NEUT1|Welcome back to Jocasta trades.
NEUT2|My name is Joseph and in today's video I'm going to be doing a lemonade technical analysis ticker symbol LMND.
NEUT3|What I see forming on the chart looks very bullish, so I'm going to show you guys the technicals and show you exactly why you should be keeping an eye on lemonade this week.

NEUT8|So right now we have lemonade pulled up on the chart and this will be a pretty quick technical analysis.
BULL9|There's not much to see on the chart, but we do know that lemonade since the IPO has shown great growth over the past year.
BEAR10|They reached a low of 44 in a high of 188, so there's a lot of people buying up this stock every time it dipped to this 50 SMAD on the chart.
NEUT11|And it just kept going higher and higher.
BEAR12|So now the fact that it eliminate has pulled back quite a bit.
NEUT13|I want to show you guys the bullish pattern that I see forming on the chart.
BEAR14|So right here we can see that lemonade has a support line right about at $80.00 an if we looked lemonade as well, has bounced off this support line twice now, once right here and then once again, which is right around here, which created a double bottom.
NEUT15|A double bottom is a bullish pattern an it's a sign to go long on the stock.
BULL16|It's showing that lemonade is honoring this support level and that buyers are buying up the stock every time it reaches around this 80 to $85 range.
NEUT17|So definitely look for a continuation on lemonade this week.
BULL18|I can definitely see them retesting their swing high, which is right around a 110 pretty soon, if not by the end of the week.
BULL19|This is a pretty decent move if you're looking to swing trade the stock.
BULL20|Right now it's at $95.00, so given the fact if it moves back up to this resistance area, that is a $15 move in your favor, which is pretty good even if you have shares an it's really really good if you have options.
NEUT21|So definitely look to buy call options for Lemonade.
BEAR22|A few weeks out, even upwards to a month out if we go over to the four hour timeframe, will see that the Mac D is starting to curl down, so I wouldn't be surprised if they eliminate starts to retest around this $90.00 level Monday and Tuesday, but definitely look for a reversal back to the upward direction.
NEUT23|an A continuation to the upside.
NEUT24|So given the fact that if you buy let's say a call option four weeks out, you have plenty of time for eliminate to reach back into this 110.
BULL25|Area this is honestly a great spot to buy shares long term as well as we can see their high is 188 and I wouldn't be surprised if lemonade reach back to their high by the end of the year or even at the start of next year.
NEUT26|So let me know what you guys think about lemonade.
BULL27|In my opinion this is a great long term company as well.
NEUT28|It's a nice insurance company and I love the set up on the chart right here which is a double bottom.
