BULL0|"""Best of all, good RX is incredible numbers."
BULL1|The company had 48% revenue growth in the first half of the year, and that's holding pretty steady since 2016.
BULL2|They've had a compound annual growth rate of 57% now.
BULL3|Maybe that's not as impressive as snowflake with triple digit growth, but could access something snowflake 1/2 years earnings.
BULL4|Yet the company is turning a profit.
BULL5|They made 55 million in the first half up from 3431 million.
NEUT6|The same.
NEUT7|2019.
BULL8|So we're talking 77% earnings growth.
NEUT9|You're not just sales with, that's a massive acceleration from which is 50% clip.
NEUT10|I told lots of like here.
BULL11|The only thing better than Turbo charge regular this turbocharged earnings growth which good RX hasn't speeds Meanwhile Good RX has been the most downloaded medical app on Apple and Google devices for the last three years.
BEAR12|Running the only flying women their user count dipped in the second quarter because of the covid lockdown.
BEAR13|Because lots of people stop calling the doctor which makes it a lot harder to get prescriptions.
NEUT14|But I bet those numbers have already turned around here specialists.
BEAR15|A lot of people desperately need to save money on medication right now.
NEUT16|OK, so then what's what's wrong?
NEUT17|It's the price like all the other recent red hots.
NEUT18|This ones expensive at these levels.
NEUT19|The company has a $19 billion market capitalization, which means it's roughly selling for roughly 30 times sales.
NEUT20|Not earnings sales and Apple, by the way, is around 30 times earnings.
BULL21|See so this makes this company a little bit more expensive than Amwell, and a little cheaper than livongo two companies with much faster revenue growth.
BEAR22|However, Good RX is proper, which changes the game problem, though, is that the earnings are still small.
BULL23|If we assume the company can keep growing rapidly, you could argue it's training.
NEUT24|It's trading in 60 times.
NEUT25|What could potentially make it 2022 but still pricey.
NEUT26|But you know what, after speaking to Co CEO Doug Hurst this morning, on squawk on the street, I'm willing to pay up for this one two reasons.
BULL27|First, the value proposition is incredible and I'm betting they can keep delivering spectacular earnings numbers.
NEUT28|Second, Good RX, largest venture capital investors, Silver Lake actually bought bought $100 million with the stock at the IPO price today.
NEUT29|Using these guys want to cash out when a company goes public but this time they up their position.
NEUT30|Bottom line, I think you can actually nibble at Good RX tomorrow if we have to pull back.
BEAR31|I actually would like it to come back to the 30s, ideally down more than 10 bucks.
NEUT32|Weird, and that's not unrealistic.
BEAR33|When you see how horrible the market is, it look.
BEAR34|Things have gotten very tough in the last three weeks.
NEUT35|I say good RX, why not be patient?
