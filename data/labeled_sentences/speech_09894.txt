NEUT0|"""Want to bring in pollster and political strategist Frank wants to our discussion this morning you've been looking at this runoff in Georgia and talking to lots of people and polling."
NEUT1|Where do you think things stand right now?
NEUT2|So I'm trying to understand specifically who's got the turn out advantage because in the end no one's going to change their votes.
NEUT3|Maybe one or two percent which you gotta figure out who's going to vote.
BEAR4|And after watching the last two weeks where so many Trump people have been disillusioned because their candidate lost for President Ann, we still find that 55% of Trump voters in Georgia 55% believe Donald Trump was elected president, and so they're mad.
BEAR5|Despite that, the Republicans have a slight advantage, first by 46 to 42% they would rather see a Republican at this time represent the state in Washington.
NEUT6|Nikki that I'm looking at are the 12% that would rather have one of each party.
NEUT7|Now the Democrats have to win both seats for them to gain control of the Senate.
BEAR8|So a split vote will not help them.
NEUT9|The other thing that I'm watching is the turn out interest.
NEUT10|80% of Republicans are definitely going to vote.
NEUT11|Only 70% of Democrats, so that can give you a one or two percent advantage for the Republicans.
NEUT12|But and this is a message for the president of the United States if he continues.
BEAR13|Too disillusioned voters, and you've got the numbers up right there.
NEUT14|Actually, that's a Corona virus we're getting to that one second.
BEAR15|If you continue to dissolution voters by saying that the elections were rigged and that your vote doesn't matter, this could have severe consequences for the administration in trying to keep those two seats Republican, I would argue that what Donald Trump says and does over the next six weeks is going to determine the outcome of the Georgia Senate race.
NEUT16|An well made determine the outcome.
NEUT17|Of our country overall.
NEUT18|Before we get to the Covid polling that you've done, which is fascinating.
NEUT19|'cause it really crosses political lines to some degree, or really is directed political lines.
NEUT20|My question to you is how rational do you think voters are in Georgia or around the country when they think about the implication?
NEUT21|If you will, of their vote.
NEUT22|The reason I ask is, I've talked to what might be described as center left voters who actually would like the Senate.
NEUT23|To be Republican really to act as simply a break on the whole system they like gridlock, they would say that they're Democrats, but they actually like the idea of gridlock.
NEUT24|There are others who obviously very much would like to turn the Senate D. And then there's others who would like it to be Republican for the for policy reasons and otherwise.
NEUT25|How do you think that actually works in reality?
NEUT26|In reality is that nobody likes gridlock, but nobody likes extremism or radical policies either.
NEUT27|And that's the key issue here.
NEUT28|Is this the Joe Biden who ran for president?
NEUT29|Or is this the Joe Biden of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and AOC and voters?
NEUT30|Still don't know that.
NEUT31|So while they don't want gridlock, want to prevent the more extreme elements?
NEUT32|The repeal of the tax cuts creating 2 new states, packing the Supreme Court, and the only way that they can do that.
NEUT33|Is by voting Republican.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
