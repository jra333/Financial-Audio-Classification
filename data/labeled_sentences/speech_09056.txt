NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT4|By 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but overall a very impressive bounce on the day when you think about the fact that the price was just down there and all of a sudden the prices battled back to where it has not gone wrong.
NEUT6|There's still work that needs to be done.
NEUT7|Point here being that's definitely been a nice move, but that does lead to more than valid question of.
NEUT8|But is there any sort of true power behind the throne?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves on a single area.
NEUT12|In that area is down here at.
NEUT13|The one 1385 Mark now why is one 1385 important?
NEUT14|I'm not saying that all this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT15|If the price were to come down to that level.
NEUT16|Behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT17|What would that be doing to the price will from a very literal point of view, that we put in the price right back inside of that range where it just was an not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT18|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly a sign of true power, true strength, or anything like that.
NEUT19|Whereas on the flip side of things, the price would come down here behave in that manner, then start to work the way back upwards and all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there you have these lows down here.
NEUT20|If you envision each one of those is Terra steps.
NEUT21|Well hey there we go.
NEUT22|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT23|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT24|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
NEUT25|It's going to make progress forward, and in this situation, quote unquote progress again, being defined right there around the one 1385 mark as far as levels of resistance are concerned near term resistance going to be that purple line right there, the 50.
NEUT26|Simple moving average currently valid it.
NEUT27|Let's just call 116 fifty, and then, as I've talked about in past videos, the more so over arching level is that resistance trend line up there.
NEUT28|But that's kind of irrelevant right now, 'cause let's just first see if the price can even break above that 50.
NEUT29|Moving average, but on all anyway you look at it great bounds today, not just a question of Canada price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
