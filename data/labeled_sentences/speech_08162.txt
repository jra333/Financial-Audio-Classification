NEUT1|Check out the moving this stock guys so the stock moved from about four bucks to $11.00 over the course of just a couple of days this has been the hottest stock in the block.
NEUT2|I mean, we've had people talking about SLS like crazy.
NEUT3|It's trending on Twitter.
NEUT4|It's turning on benzinga.com.
NEUT5|The content that we're doing.
BULL6|It's been super hot on SLS.
BEAR7|The retail traders love us less right now.
NEUT8|That's just the stock is moved from 4 bucks to 12 bucks.
NEUT9|That said, I'm I'm coming out against this one.
NEUT10|And an and let let me back up.
NEUT11|Why I'm saying that right?
BULL12|The the stock is up on news that that they signed a deal for somebody else to sell their treatment in China, right?
NEUT13|This is a health care play.
NEUT14|They announced the deal where a company is basically going to be selling on their behalf in China.
BULL15|SLS will receive a seven and a half $1,000,000 upfront milestone payment.
NEUT16|You know, the stock selling at a market cap of 24 million.
NEUT17|So yes, that is significant.
NEUT18|But again, seven and a half million bucks.
NEUT19|I mean, how far does that get you as a public company?
NEUT20|I'm not guessing very far.
NEUT21|Other news is that they can get up to $200 million of milestone payments, but I imagine I don't know.
NEUT22|But but when I've seen a lot of these deal structure in the past to get to that full milestone payment mark, I mean, it's it's typically almost freaking impossible.
NEUT23|Like I mean, the things gotta just blow out and blow out and blow out and blow out any sort of sort of realistic expectation.
NEUT24|So if anybody's looking at this and saying oh they're gonna get 20 million bucks, this is a 10 bagger automatically.
NEUT25|That's not the case.
NEUT26|I think that's where a lot of of of the interest is going is.
NEUT27|Is that type of thinking?
NEUT28|And then the royalty deal again?
NEUT29|Isn't even that great, so SLS if you know this third party's tells their treatment in China, they only get single digits of the revenue if a **** ton of it gets old, they get into the double digits for the most part, the only single digits of the revenue.
NEUT30|So basically you're asking somebody else to sell your product for you and you're going to take a single digit percent.
NEUT31|The hardest part of operating a business.
NEUT32|I mean, we know this from Benzinga is selling the product and it's tough to get somebody to depend on somebody else to do it for you.
NEUT33|So that's why I do not love this pop in SLS.
NEUT34|Check it out again.
BULL35|The stock went from 4 bucks.
NEUT36|Now it's at 12 I got.
NEUT37|Almost as high as 20 and I want to Crowdsource this thing to you guys.
NEUT38|"Anne."""
