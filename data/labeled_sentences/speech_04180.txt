NEUT0|"""Four catalysts that could fuel a 2021 bull market."
NEUT1|2020 was quite frankly bonkers.
NEUT2|And after a year like this one making hard and fast predictions about the future seems like a suckers game at best.
NEUT3|But fool Sean Williams has gathered together for events that if they come to pass could keep Wall Street's good times rolling for at least another 365 days.
NEUT4|Americans gave their COVID-19 vaccine on mass doctor Anthony Fauci, who has most definitely made Santa's nice list this year, predicts that 191 million Americans will need to get inoculated against COVID-19 in order to create herd immunity.
NEUT5|Where enough people have protection from the virus to prevent it from spreading among people who don't.
BULL6|If we can reach that milestone, the economy should return more or less to normal.
NEUT7|But first, we've got to persuade enough people to get the shot and make sure its manufacturers can produce enough of this stuff to me.
NEUT8|That demand.
NEUT9|Stimulus clause comes to town.
NEUT10|Congress passed $2.2 trillion in stimulus back in March without so much as blinking.
NEUT11|But while their house had another round ready to go in July, equals equals stimulus checks.
NEUT12|State and local funding, the whole shebang.
BULL13|The Senate dragged its feet until just this week, when it finally managed to hammer out a far smaller and screw gear deal.
NEUT14|Looking at you Mitch McConnell.
NEUT15|If by some belated holiday miracle, additional stimulus gets passed in the new year.
NEUT16|Spectre, the markets and the millions of hardworking Americans currently staring down hunger, unemployment and potential eviction to celebrate.
NEUT17|The Fed keeps money cheap as long as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates at or near their current record lows.
BULL18|Businesses will be able to borrow money for a relative song in order to hire workers, expand operations and keep the market humming.
NEUT19|History keeps doing its thing.
NEUT20|Guess what tends to happen.
NEUT21|"Historically speaking, the year after the SNP 500 grows by a double digit percentage more than six times out of 10, it does so again and 82% of the time it ends that subsequent year with some kind of positive return."""
