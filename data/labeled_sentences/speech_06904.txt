NEUT0|"""What do you think?"
NEUT1|Will we see some sort of coordinated action?
NEUT2|Reuters just flashing this headline?
NEUT3|That apparently the statement is going to say perhaps.
NEUT4|Otherwise at this point in time.
NEUT5|But what do you think it does?
NEUT6|The global economy needs some sort of coordinated action.
NEUT7|As a very good question, I think that the likelihood of us getting anything substantial out of the G7 finance ministers is extremely remote.
NEUT8|I mean, if you think about the difficulties that a lot of the regions involved here have got in doing anything in terms of expansion fiscal policy, then you very quickly come up thinking.
NEUT9|Yeah, that's that's not really a workable option.
NEUT10|Coordinated monetary policy.
NEUT11|Yeah, I guess it's possible, but coordinated with whom in the US is the only central bank with any room to cut here?
NEUT12|So we've had.
NEUT13|We've had this sort of usual.
NEUT14|You know, we are monitoring the situation closely.
NEUT15|We stand ready to blah, blah blah blah from the ECB.
NEUT16|Over the Bank of Japan, but actually it's only the US who can who can do anything here so you know, coordinated in terms of words and the market is taking a lot from this.
NEUT17|And let's be absolutely honest here.
NEUT18|Nothing has actually happened yet, they just said they'll they might do something.
NEUT19|And well, yeah, they will.
NEUT20|the Fed will cut shortly, but you know what are the rest going to do?
NEUT21|Yeah, how much do you expect the Fed will cut by and how large or when?
NEUT22|When do you think that will happen?
NEUT23|Will it be at this month's meeting?
NEUT24|Would you perhaps see some sort of emergency measures that just going to spook the markets if we have?
NEUT25|Some sort of emergency 50 basis point cut out of the Fed?
NEUT26|Yeah, it's difficult really.
NEUT27|I was chatting about this with a colleague earlier today and if you do something before the meeting then what do you do at the meeting?
NEUT28|Do you have to follow up with something else as well?
NEUT29|Well, you probably do so I think at this stage.
NEUT30|Well, most of them still are trying to figure out exactly what the implications of this are.
NEUT31|They're not going to want to box themselves in with moving too rapidly, so I think a lot of encouraging words leading up to that March 18th meeting and then 50 at that meeting and with plenty of scope and plenty of hints that there's more to come down the track.
NEUT32|Should that be necessary?
NEUT33|OK, Dan is a question for you.
NEUT34|Rob to your point, and this is really interesting, isn't it?
BULL35|Because yes, while the Fed can improve liquida tion, it can loosen monetary policy to try and navigate markets in the economy through this coronavirus outbreak, jaypal can't necessarily repair a broken supply chain, and he can't go and tap the Chinese business traveler on the shoulder and say it's OK. You can go back to China now, So what impact will lower rates actually have here?
NEUT36|And I guess from a personal perspective, would you be traveling to China today?
NEUT37|Well, that last point, no.
BULL38|And and you're absolutely right.
NEUT39|I mean actually, people talk about talking about the the supply boosting measures and the demand boosting version.
NEUT40|Of course, monetary policy typically works through the demand channels, but even then you know all the sorts of things that you're talking about.
NEUT41|Tourism, you know, going, eating out, sticking yourself in a metal box with a load of people you don't know, like public transport.
NEUT42|These are things where an interest rate cut is not going to encourage you to to increase the demand for those consumer services.
NEUT43|So in almost every level it doesn't work, and what you you probably need is is policy is which will address.
NEUT44|You know if this starts to become a much more widespread epidemic or pandemic, and you see really big impact on supply chains and the way that China has what you need are measures of financial forbearance.
NEUT45|In affirms won't be earning, they won't be able to get their product out.
BEAR46|There won't be able to make their product will still be having to pay employees.
BEAR47|They'll still have creditors bang on their door for the money.
BULL48|And yeah, to some extent they'll have some debt service and it helps a little bit at the margin there.
NEUT49|"But really, that that you know interest rate cuts do very little in this environment."""
