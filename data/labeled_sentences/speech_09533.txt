BULL6|Thank you and enjoy the video Apple gains on the week.
BULL7|It it was up about 5% at best levels.
NEUT8|Now it's given some of that up.
BEAR9|It's up about 3% right now and you can see this pattern in here, so Apple is a little bit different than some of the real negative stocks we've seen because this right over here is a monstrous move and it gives up past the 78.6%.
NEUT10|So when a stock is bullish.
NEUT11|And you can see in here there are actually minor 3rd, so these are called harmonic families.
NEUT12|You learn about that in the cycle Analysis Workshop also.
NEUT13|And now we're peaking in this first minor third.
NEUT14|You can see that.
BULL15|And Becauses breaking this 78.6%, the probability was high.
NEUT16|It would reverse under the 61.8.
BULL17|That's wrong, pointing at right now, but it actually got up close to the 78.6.
NEUT18|It's not that unusual.
NEUT19|However, it's not the highest probability.
NEUT20|The probability was that it would stop.
BULL21|Short of that earnings, and here came out well, not bad.
BULL22|I mean, the numbers were really OK. Maybe better than people expected based on the effects of the coronavirus on most other companies and this stock.
BULL23|The analysts are raised, were raising their targets on it.
BEAR24|The stock tried to rally again today, but then tick back down.
BEAR25|It's not down much, so a little over 1% right now on the day and gains on the week.
NEUT26|You can see that we do not believe this is going past the 78.6%.
NEUT27|So the first minor 3rd right over here could easily get you down here to about 265 that would be sometime in late May or early June, so that's kind of our initial target.
NEUT28|Then we want to see what kind of a rally this brings us right in here.
NEUT29|So we think Apple is done for now.
BEAR30|In this upside move, there are revenues, year over year actually fell these analysts.
NEUT31|They really want to be bullish, but but not me.
BEAR32|I mean, I really think that the stock is destined for a much bigger decline and when you look at the dates right over here, this big cycle that you see right there takes you out to November.
BEAR33|I think by that time the stock is going to be pushing this low closer to 220.
NEUT34|Then it is up here close to 3:20, and I'll bet you I get a lot of people that argue that with me in here in Apple.
NEUT35|Alright, so that is it.
BEAR36|And that's all about the weakness that I see in the economy moving forward.
BEAR37|"That I think is going to be severe."""
