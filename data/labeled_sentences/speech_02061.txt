NEUT0|"""We'll be talking about Coca Cola."
NEUT1|Basically why we talking about this is because today, well yesterday I was doing some surfing like I normally do around 2:00 PM, twelve o'clock, and I saw online that Coke is gonna be adding cannabis infused or CBD again, weed infused drinks to their lineup.
NEUT2|Or is talk about it and I was like damn so alright alright.
NEUT3|So let me go watch the stock market.
NEUT4|So I went as soon as I got online I saw the Aurora.
BULL5|Up Canopy was up.
NEUT6|Well.
BEAR7|Canopy went up like really early in the day and then it dipped.
NEUT8|But then I looked at Aurora rose up and I was like what the **** is a roll up like 15% then I did some more digging.
BULL9|Found out that Coke is trying to talk about a deal with Aurora or there's rumors whispers and you should happen yet but ****** ******* whispering the stock go up.
NEUT10|That's how volatile this industry is still right after learning that I was like huh I was like huh?
NEUT11|How can I get in on this ship potentially getting on this **** right?
NEUT12|That's what we talked about today.
NEUT13|Why will I be purchasing Coca Cola stock?
NEUT14|I'm repurchasing Coca Cola stock for three reasons.
NEUT15|First reason is because Coke is talking to the cannabis industry potentially talking to the cancer industry about infusing beverages, and cannabis is the future.
NEUT16|That's where we're going.
NEUT17|So there's gonna be legal.
NEUT18|I think.
NEUT19|I just heard Tilray got like some license.
NEUT20|Something export to the US or some funny **** like that.
NEUT21|If big beverage companies like Constellation, he's ******* companies adding on like they're jumping on to these these pot stocks and all these pop companies.
NEUT22|It would make sense if you want to stay in business to at least have a line when it is CBD in the drink and not THC CBD is meant for like joints and pain in neck and back and swelling and **** like that.
NEUT23|Anti inflammatory right?
NEUT24|And that's what Coke is trying to.
NEUT25|They're trying to create like a Wellness beverage, right?
NEUT26|So that's the first reason because of innovation right?
NEUT27|You gotta keep **** moving old **** dead that ****.
NEUT28|Oh ****.
NEUT29|Two coping around forever and around forever it's like a ******* blue chip stock right now you probably got a Coke on your desk watching this **** you feel me.
BEAR30|And also I heard that will rent that they're trying to cut down on the sugar.
NEUT31|That's also why they go into the CBD market because they're trying to cut down on the sugar in their beverages for the consumer.
BEAR32|Could know that **** is ******* people up.
NEUT33|Third is because they paid and I still didn't.
NEUT34|You know?
NEUT35|I mean, I'm a dividend guy.
NEUT36|You know that if you ******* channel ******* Shaq talks talks, you know I'm a dividend God.
NEUT37|**** with you for like $0.39 per share.
BULL38|Not bad.
NEUT39|I think it's like 4732 was the last time I looked at Coke per share.
NEUT40|It's not bad.
NEUT41|So those are the three reasons why will be invested in Coke.
NEUT42|Quickly before the video ends guys, will you be invested in Coke after watching this video or Aurora?
NEUT43|What do you think about the CBD when you think about all this ****?
