NEUT0|"""All day we heard rumors that Uber is about to acquire Grubhub in an all stock deal."
NEUT1|That would value the business at roughly $6.25 billion.
BEAR2|If you close the report that the two companies might not be able to agree on price.
BULL3|But I'm hoping Uber is willing to pay more because this would be a genius move for every year.
NEUT4|I've been saying that Uber's Achilles heel is Uber eats their delivery business.
BEAR5|There's just too much competition, delivery spaces, question profitability.
BEAR6|Uber knows that investors cheered when the company pulled out of some of those markets that were the most dreary before the pandemic.
BEAR7|There was a lousy business here in the US.
BEAR8|The restaurants have been able to pick the big delivery services against each other, problems the dominant player, but they've been struggling because their customers have no real brand loyalty.
NEUT9|They've got no problem switching to Postmates and DoorDash if it means they had a better deal.
NEUT10|CEO Matt Maloney said it.
BEAR11|He called customers promiscuous.
BEAR12|One of his releases couldn't agree more, however his clubs dominance has been challenged.
BULL13|They've responded with incredibly cool technology.
BULL14|Thanks to COVID-19, that technology is suddenly a lot more valuable.
NEUT15|For example, they let you order takeout from a restaurant, and you'll know precisely when it will be ready.
NEUT16|It's like a train time schedule.
NEUT17|There you are.
NEUT18|You can get in and out rather than getting stuck in line at a time when mass people are supposed to be stay 6 feet apart but instead are massless Anna right next each other gets better as firms have been forced to embrace delivery there.
BULL19|Now reckoning with the fact that delivery services can be really spotting.
BULL20|Plus everyone wants a strong competitor to the venture capital funding door Dash.
NEUT21|We just acquired caviar from square.
BEAR22|In some ways, DoorDash has become too powerful.
NEUT23|Restaurants wanted partner.
NEUT24|They can get food to the customer quickly and with the least expense.
NEUT25|The best way to get that is to Pita Fortify Grubhub.
BULL26|Uber eats against the DoorDash.
BEAR27|Grubhub is currently lacking coverage for its full House delivery service, who breaches probably thought to be too expensive.
NEUT28|Put them together.
BULL29|I think we got a real winner.
BULL30|This combination makes so much sense for the industry that I think it would actually allow post mates to finally come public.
BULL31|Good company these companies can thrive in a world where there are three viable delivery services.
NEUT32|That's just the right amount of competition.
BULL33|Could be great.
NEUT34|So one fell swoop.
BULL35|This deal would create an incredible amount of value for Kuberan, Grubhub shareholders, restaurants, winter paying, maybe a little bit more.
BULL36|But the major operators would be able to offer consistent service that is really worth the trade off.
NEUT37|If I were Matt Maloney, the CEO of Grubhub, I would hold out.
NEUT38|I bet you can get two point.
BULL39|Five shares of Uber for each share of Grubhub, up from 2.15 number where we hear about earlier.
NEUT40|Come on, Matt, the deal makes too much sense not to do that said in the year of Covid, I'll take a deal any deal just to show a pulse in the M&A market, which is pretty much ceased to exist.
NEUT41|Until today, stick with grammar.
