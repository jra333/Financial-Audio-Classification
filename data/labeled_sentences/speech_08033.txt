NEUT0|"""Age playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, quite the eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man, well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first area of support is what I would call the ideal automatically.
BULL8|One make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price could say up there.
BULL9|Above that 131 mark.
NEUT10|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 131.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have to price could stay above that level.
BULL12|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Now, taking a step back and looking at things from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by, that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there, being defined as the move, just watch that Purple line.
NEUT17|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control rights.
NEUT18|Visualize that that is what has been represented.
NEUT19|Again, yes and above 131 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT20|As long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|Let's squeeze down the chart here a little bit.
NEUT22|Next Big Battle ground here for Apple.
BEAR23|Moving forward, going to be right up here at one 3260 and if you go back through the history of the chart you can see that this area has been very, very stubborn.
NEUT24|So while I'm not saying it's impossible to break through this area, I'm just saying that when you look at those past couple of times right there, you know it's been a struggle and even write their price never hit exactly, but got, you know, within the general vicinity of it and once again struggled with that area.
BULL25|So that will certainly be Rd block number one moving forward, but All in all, any angle you look at it, great volume today, very impressive price movement.
NEUT26|Not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward?
NEUT27|Let's see what happens.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
