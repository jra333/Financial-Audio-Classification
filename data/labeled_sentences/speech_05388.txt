NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm gonna be talking about the cryptocurrency enj again, so this is engine coin.
NEUT3|I'm going to be looking at it against tether US from finance.
NEUT4|As a disclaimer, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT5|This videos, not financial advice.
NEUT6|If you're gonna do any investing, go speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT7|So that being said, let's just kick it right off so I talked about this one.
NEUT8|I think yesterday around like midnight, so pretty late, but if you go back and pull up that technical analysis video, or really any of the GTA videos I've been making, you would see, like right around that like $2.33 Mark is what I said.
NEUT9|Kind of needed to act as support on the daily chart.
BEAR10|So once we started to lose that level yesterday, I kind of mentioned it was starting to feel a little bit weak.
BEAR11|So we had a pretty big red candle that dipped all the way below it and I kind of mentioned my next level to watch would be the low twos, potentially down to like 210 and this one got pretty close.
BEAR12|It went down to like 213 to 14 so I mean it was almost a 10% drop a little bit less so that was a pretty significant drop even though it doesn't look like much.
NEUT13|I would have offered some pretty decent entries, so at this point now the level I want to see hold is like 210.
BEAR14|Anything below that and on the daily like a close below that on the daily and I really would have a hard time staying super bullish on this one in the short term as long as we continue to put in some higher lows though like as long as we can put in some higher lows from this little area.
BULL15|I think this one still looks fine on the daily chart.
NEUT16|So if you want to see like my thoughts on like support and resistance is just go back and watch my video from yesterday.
NEUT17|I think now the levels to watch to the upside to be 233 we need a daily candle to just close above that.
BULL18|Now with some strength maybe get some volume coming back in but it would need to recapture this this level.
NEUT19|So typically when a support is lost it becomes a new resistance.
BEAR20|So it's kind of been trying to get through it all day so far.
NEUT21|So I would like to see that start to happen and then potentially bounce around in this range again and then a break about that 270 with volume and holding above it would be, you know, making like ultimately bullish on this one.
NEUT22|Not saying you can't scale in before that, but that's just kind of what we would be watching just to see how this candle closes 'cause it is breaking above that level now.
NEUT23|But there's still five hours left.
NEUT24|So people like the four hour chart and this is something I talked about in my last video.
NEUT25|As you can see here we had this like.
NEUT26|Channel to the downside on the four hour chart.
BEAR27|So it kind of started to lose that level.
NEUT28|That was when you got like a pretty nice move to the downside.
NEUT29|You could potentially potentially bought this dip.
BULL30|It was pretty close to the resistance or the support level I had drawn out, but now we're starting to balance a little bit Mackie starting to curl.
NEUT31|This one is starting to get a little bit of volume on it a little bit more eyes on it.
BULL32|Starting to break back above 233.
NEUT33|The only things I want to see I want to see a lot more volume start to come in if we are going to break out, I think the green volume like a lot of the buying volume needs to be a lot bigger than the red volume candles to really make this one strong because of the volume stays really low and we start getting above you at 233 mark and there's really not a lot of volume on the daily chart.
BEAR34|I'm going to have a hard time flipping back to being bullish on this one.
NEUT35|So I think volumes like one of the biggest things to watch now and just seeing if it breaks above this 233 and close above it, or if it starts to come back down to like the mid to low.
NEUT36|Like the two two 2225 kind of range.
NEUT37|So those are just some of the levels I'd be watching, especially in the short term.
NEUT38|But you can go back and look at some of my older engine technical analysis videos if you want like some of the big picture ideas I've been talking about as well, but that's just what I'm watching for just pretty much for today and maybe into tomorrow.
NEUT39|So this video is valuable at all.
