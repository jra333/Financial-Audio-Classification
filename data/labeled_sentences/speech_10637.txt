NEUT0|"""Lloyd Blankfein, of course everybody, has an opinion right now about where specs fit in in terms of the overall market narrative."
NEUT1|Certainly Lloyd Blankfein, earlier on, Squawk weighed in on that.
NEUT2|Here's what he said.
NEUT3|If a few of these go bad or they were overpaid and some people made a lot of money and investors lost money, people are going to say where you know you achieve the economic equivalent of an IPO.
NEUT4|But where was the process and diligence that we all associated with a rigorous IPO diligence process and that kind of drops out now.
NEUT5|Not saying that they're all bad, or that any of the ones that you could bring up are there, but some of these won't work and I my advice to people who are doing this now.
NEUT6|Would be really really diligence really really documents, but you know again in hindsight, if something goes bad down the road, people will look back and you know, you know, show trials to follow.
NEUT7|Wow Jim Adamson Golda of Taboola this morning on Squawk made the argument look we're all trying to be well behaved public companies on the other side, why should you?
NEUT8|Why should you look negatively upon us as we go through this Crucible in a different way?
NEUT9|Well look, I think that people are genuinely excited.
NEUT10|A lot of what's going on our younger investors hate to keep coming back to them, but they're very excited about what these companies are doing and the way they express their excitement.
NEUT11|Is to buy stock.
NEUT12|They don't just sit there and say boy this is interesting David.
NEUT13|They place bets on the stock they do and you can see these moves.
BULL14|Many of them were having not the handler not the locate land Kateland Cadia one that's Tillman Fertitta or Chandler doing that deal this morning, but everything else is moving up significantly.
NEUT15|Foley of course, remember they did their last deal is at 19 right BFT?
NEUT16|Is not the symbol on that they haven't closed it yet, but they announced it.
NEUT17|This is about having so much money.
BULL18|There's so much there is a man by the way, the investment banks are benefiting.
NEUT19|I mean, it's funny listening to blank fine, but Goldman list their underwriting.
NEUT20|This packs.
NEUT21|They're also getting merger credit as well when the deals are done, because remember, they are a merger, even though really it is a way of course to go public.
BULL22|It's also credited as a merger, so Wall Street is very happy with this and it will continue for some time.
NEUT23|And of course to his point there are going to be those that are not good and they're going to be plenty that that succeed.
NEUT24|As well, there's no doubt.
BULL25|We're just pointing out some of the moves here ahead of time, and you know they're already valuing many of these companies far above where they were valued on their last round when they were private.
BULL26|Having raised money and yet there, then getting a boost in the stock market to the tune of 3070% in some of these names, which is pretty extraordinary at this point, but not unlike what we've been seeing to a certain extent, Jim and some of the IPO's that we've been seeing.
NEUT27|Well, yes, I mean, there's just.
NEUT28|If you look at Snowflake, if you look at door Dash list somewhere, BNB Air BNB very, very successful.
NEUT29|Never really came in.
NEUT30|I want to go back if you don't mind to bed, Bath and beyond.
NEUT31|So loops.
BEAR32|Note today says they do a periodic pricing price gap is narrowing.
NEUT33|It doesn't matter.
NEUT34|David, it's 67% sure it just gives these people another reason to break the shorts.
NEUT35|And that's what this is about.
NEUT36|There's this, not this packs, but the big short positions the shorts better cover because the logs are coming for you.
NEUT37|Yeah, yeah, that's getting more evident every day, Jim.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
