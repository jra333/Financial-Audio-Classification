NEUT0|"""JDA, we start with one hour chart."
NEUT1|OK, further analyze this.
BEAR2|As we mentioned, we want to get the price to drop and this is what we get.
NEUT3|And even if we refer to one analysis when the price was within this movie mentioned, we need to get the proper reversal trade set up to look for.
BULL4|Buying OK as we can see the price broke the previous low.
NEUT5|No want to see whether we can look for trade or not and what we get here is still we don't have any.
NEUT6|Trade setup, no.
NEUT7|Wanna see how we can trade it because currently we got this down move.
BEAR8|I mean we got this correction related to this.
NEUT9|Any reversal from here we can look for by but we don't have the reversal yet.
NEUT10|And even if we move to 15 minutes.
NEUT11|We cannot call this one as a reversal.
NEUT12|Simply.
NEUT13|We can put this one in relative to this.
NEUT14|All these things for woman drop.
NEUT15|OK, for sure if the price retest this Loanny River so we can look for by, but it doesn't mean the price cannot reverse from here.
NEUT16|Even if we get everywhere.
NEUT17|So we can look for by then.
NEUT18|We need to look for by set up alright in this case we start with higher time frame.
NEUT19|And as you can see this on daily chart, we want to see whether this is a correction relative to this for continuation and we want to see whether the only things we want to see whether the price can broke the can break the previous stop or not, because the first the second times when the price.
NEUT20|I mean after the price we get the highest price.
NEUT21|I mean there's this one the next time when the price reverse it couldn't break the previous stop, even it based on lower timeframes tag, but it couldn't break and continue.
NEUT22|No wanna see how complex can be.
NEUT23|That's why it's still we're looking for this correction.
NEUT24|Or continuation, but in over analyzes we mentioned made this 110 two.
NEUT25|Correction for one more drop before we get the next move.
NEUT26|We are not looking for the down move.
NEUT27|Just we need to be aware if you want to take the trade and even if we move to forward chart as we can see still we're looking at this correction.
NEUT28|And this is what we were expected.
NEUT29|And because we mentioned we want the price to break the previous stop and this is 1.13, this is what we expected.
NEUT30|This happened because now we put this correction relative to this.
NEUT31|But to look for trade we need to get the reverser because what we get here specially this shadow, it doesn't give us any good traits that are 4 by.
BEAR32|That's why it's still we can expect this one to drop a bit more before we get the next move.
NEUT33|By the way, if you get any trade setup with the break out of this so we start to manage.
NEUT34|But we need to get through it, set up with a sharp move, not the corrective.
NEUT35|OK. And.
NEUT36|Rather than that, we have nothing else to talk about.
BEAR37|An if we move to one hour chart as I mentioned, is still as we can see, the prices start to drop.
NEUT38|By the way, how deep it can go?
NEUT39|We cannot confirm even with the price, can break 1.138, but any reversal from there we can take it all right now we're looking at the trade setup to look for by the only things we want to see how deep it can go on right now.
NEUT40|We don't have any trade setup and we should know that even this one can if there is a continuation, we can expect the price for it is.
NEUT41|This look if the price retest this road then we cannot look at the buy from this correction and we cannot put this correction in related to this because at that time, so we need to see the entire structure.
NEUT42|Alright, then maybe we need to put this one as a relative each other.
NEUT43|We need to be aware of this, that's why I mentioned if we want to look for my we need to get the reversal in case.
BEAR44|This one is start to drop and we get this internal.
NEUT45|Correction alright, by the way, right now we're looking at this.
NEUT46|We're looking at the by.
NEUT47|The only thing says I want to see you.
NEUT48|Whether we can get the reversal by setup or not OK, and as I mentioned, any short movie The flag we can take it for continuation.
NEUT49|If easy, then continuation with the price is moving sharp.
NEUT50|We keep that rate if moving as a corrective we don't stay with the trade at all.
BULL51|OK, by the way we just followed the chart.
NEUT52|"If I see any update I will share, thanks."""
