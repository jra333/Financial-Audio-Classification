BULL0|"""I thought that this was a really fantastic quarter."
NEUT1|A couple reasons.
NEUT2|One is is that if you look at the financials of Tesla they are as clean as can be.
BULL3|An I could argue that this company is doing incredibly well.
NEUT4|The conference call was a conference call that reminds me of people who just want to tell the truth.
NEUT5|Stratus can be you on Musk.
BULL6|I'm not saying he's restrained reason Straitjacket, but what a terrific conference call.
NEUT7|It's very hard to think.
NEUT8|Negatively about this company, I know that there are people who talk obviously valuation, but there are a couple upgrades today and I think they have.
NEUT9|They can't fight.
NEUT10|It is the the reason why they can't fight is because when everything works it's very difficult to argue what the price should be.
BULL11|Because right now this company is doing incredibly well and they make as many cars as they say.
NEUT12|What you're going to say is you know what I know that it sells at a gigantic price, turning small price to multiple whatever.
NEUT13|But David, when I read through the Tesla notes, what I what I read, our analysts who are just saying, you know what?
NEUT14|I can't fight it anymore.
NEUT15|I have to like it.
BULL16|Yeah, I did notice one of those fashionably late title Baird upgrading to outperform.
NEUT17|I mean fashionably.
NEUT18|Look at the move in that stock I.
NEUT19|At this point I'm not sure you want to weigh in and say you're out you're upgrading.
BEAR20|Now that's that's pretty embarrassing.
NEUT21|But Jim, when you get to the metrics that you're looking at to try to determine what the price should be granted, if this company is operating extraordinarily well, I still wonder.
NEUT22|What is an appropriate multiple mean?
NEUT23|They still largely are.
NEUT24|I mean, again, you argue their technology company.
NEUT25|That's what I think you have to.
BEAR26|I mean, this morning there are two price target bumps for Ford.
BULL27|Now I happen to think Ford is doing extremely well because they decided to not lose as much money as they used to talking about JP.
NEUT28|JP Morgan going from 7 to 9 Barclays 8 tonight.
NEUT29|But you know what David these are companies that are bound by the conventional 4 walls of the spreadsheet.
NEUT30|People are not going to give forward any of the credit because they don't like this whole model.
NEUT31|I had Mr Fister on last night and basically what those guys do is make a car OK and it sells 'cause it's great looking and that's what I feel about Elon Musk.
NEUT32|He makes cars but he's fully integrated the cars 500.
NEUT33|Whatever he sells.
NEUT34|Whatever he makes, he's gonna sell.
NEUT35|There's no dealer network.
NEUT36|And now he started to say the same thing in China.
NEUT37|So what you see is a frictionless model, so you have the analyst who don't know what to do.
NEUT38|They really don't.
NEUT39|Because they've been wrong.
NEUT40|David, they've been so wrong that it's better just to say, you know what?
NEUT41|I definitely understand the valuation, but I do think the company is a pretty good company and that's where these people are coming down.
NEUT42|It's amazing.
NEUT43|I can't think of another to place time I've ever seen it.
NEUT44|No, really, no?
NEUT45|Meanwhile, the company is where CEO is masterful, where a company has done amazing things and the financials no longer seem member with short sellers requires the financials are phoning.
NEUT46|You take a little bit of movies that yes, you know Carl, I know the credits matter but what really matters?
NEUT47|I think with Teslas is that it's flawless, flawless execution even in the time of covid they ended up doing everything right and Carla.
NEUT48|I just read it and I think if this word tech company it deserves to sell exactly where it's selling.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
