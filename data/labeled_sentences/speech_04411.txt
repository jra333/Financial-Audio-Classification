NEUT0|"""Hi guys and welcome back in this video I'm just going to share an update on my options that I bought back in February."
NEUT1|But before I continue just want to let you know that I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT2|This is just for entertainment purposes only.
NEUT3|I also created a Patreon page where like minded people can talk about thoughts, whether that is Penny, stock growth stocks and dividend stocks as well as options in crypto currencies.
NEUT4|So if you guys are interested check out my link down below.
BULL5|So Amazon is up 2% for the day, but we take a look at this six month chart.
BEAR6|It's just been trading in this range of 3000 and 3300, so I bought my first option contract back in February and ever since then the stock has been moving sideways or been going down.
NEUT7|Well, when I first bought it, the option was worth 26,000 and now it's only worth $1000.
NEUT8|So that's how much value is lost from beta decay, and the closer that it is to expiration dates, which is 2 weeks away now.
NEUT9|The Theta will just increase, so if Amazon doesn't get to 3400 by April 16th.
BEAR10|I will lose the rest of whatever is in here, which is not much.
NEUT11|There is only $9000 left.
NEUT12|If you take a look at the data.
BEAR13|It's negative 839.
NEUT14|What that means is every single day that goes by an loses $839, so that number will increase the closer that it gets to April 16th.
BEAR15|So this will definitely be my biggest loss so far since I've been trading an few things I learned is cut losses.
NEUT16|Fast, because the longer we hold off these losses, the bigger hole we put ourselves in.
NEUT17|And also I need to stay away from buying short term options.
NEUT18|Anything less than six months I need to stay away from.
NEUT19|So how can I recover this back?
NEUT20|Well, it's going to take a very long time and I was thinking of taking whatever I have left, which is 9000 today.
NEUT21|It will go down Monday because of the data, so whatever the value I have in there, I was going to take it out, place them on some yellow beds.
NEUT22|So if you guys have any suggestions, let me know because.
NEUT23|I rather put it on something that I can possibly make some money back than Amazon because we know Amazon is not going to 3400.
NEUT24|I shouldn't even be wasting my time with them.
BULL25|They are going to get to 3400, but in the next two weeks not going to happen unless there's a major event, but we had good earnings.
NEUT26|We have all these good news about Amazon and nothing.
NEUT27|The stock is still at 3161 so it's been flat for the last nine months, so let me know what you guys think.
BULL28|"Thanks for watching guys."""
