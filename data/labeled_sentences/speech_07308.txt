NEUT0|"""The two year yield, which looks a lot like the German yield, which is a chart of disinflation Carl Weinberg are we dis inflating, or do we need to worry about the Dallas trim?"
NEUT1|CPI is Chairman Powell would like us to worry about.
NEUT2|Well, I think inflation is low and slow and steady.
NEUT3|I think that's the best way to think about it.
NEUT4|We're not in any danger of deflation, I believe.
BEAR5|But however, we are at a very, very historic low and inflation and bond yields are appropriately low.
NEUT6|Reflecting both as it do to retirees, I was around the Barbie in Faroe.
NEUT7|We're doing beyond meat in Central Park and you know a lot of fossils are with us.
NEUT8|What are the what are the fossils do fossils?
NEUT9|The fossils they need to save guys older than us?
NEUT10|They need to save.
NEUT11|There's no real yield.
NEUT12|What do they do?
NEUT13|Well they live a little bit less large than they thought they were going to and there certainly is some imbalance.
BULL14|Perhaps between peoples retirement expectations and what they're actually going to be able to realize at some point, interest rates will go up again.
BEAR15|At some point, inflation will probably go up again.
NEUT16|At some point the Fed will be tightening with a higher degree of intensity than it is right now, because there will be clear signs that it will be needed.
NEUT17|It's not right at this moment, so we're at a transition point, but this is not forever and I think that's what retirees have to look forward to that the future will be different.
NEUT18|But Carl, once at some point is it.
NEUT19|Second half of this year is that after the next recession, well, it's going to be when it's going to be when prices start responding to a low unemployment rate and when the unemployment rate gets unsustainably low.
BEAR20|At some point the Fed has to stop the unemployment rate from falling.
BULL21|"It has to do it permanently and it even had probably has to push it up a little bit overtime and the point comes the Fed will be raising rates with intensity, and when that happens we'll see bond yields start to go up again."""
