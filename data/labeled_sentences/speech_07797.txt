NEUT0|"""Alright, let's turn our attention to Julia LaRoche."
NEUT1|She is watching the news of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway buying into gold and Anne.
NEUT2|How would you describe this best?
NEUT3|Julia?
NEUT4|Because he and Charlie Munger used to trash gold.
NEUT5|OK, Adam?
NEUT6|Warren Buffett reported his second quarter stock moves on Friday afternoon and there was only one knew a single purchase of a public equity and that was of the gold mining stock.
BULL7|Barrick Gold snapping up.
NEUT8|20.9 million shares and of course, Barrick Gold is moving on this news.
NEUT9|I'm checking the stock right now.
BULL10|It's up about 11.93%, so he's probably made about just on paper gains since Friday, 70 million on that position.
NEUT11|Just to give you a little bit of context, Barrick Gold course.
NEUT12|The new position for him.
NEUT13|It ranks about #22 in Warren Buffett's famous stock portfolio.
NEUT14|It's a pretty miniscule position when you look at it broadly, because if you look at the names up there, I'm talking about Apple NASA position for him.
NEUT15|Bank of America, another one.
NEUT16|Coca Cola being another so it's a very small percentage of the portfolio, but still a big move for someone who in the past historically, along with his right hand man, Charlie Munger have disc gold in some of his annual meetings in the past.
NEUT17|They basically said that look gold is not a productive asset.
BEAR18|They've called it an unproductive asset.
NEUT19|Once Warren Buffett in 2000 said I would rather trust in the intrinsic value of a bunch of really fine businesses run by good manager selling products that people like to buy an have like to buy for a long time, he referenced up in that.
NEUT20|Sees candy in Coca Cola, for example.
NEUT21|Versus.
NEUT22|You know, taking a piece of metal that people dig out of the ground in South Africa and then put it back in the ground at Fort Knox.
NEUT23|Of course he's also said that it's not a very good store of value.
NEUT24|He said that he would.
BEAR25|I would say that gold would be way down on the list as a store of value, that something he said at the 2005 annual meeting.
NEUT26|Buffett, whose dad by the way, was a gold enthusiast and someone who liked the gold Standard said that he would even bet his life that Berkshire Hathaway shares over a 50 year.
BULL27|Would outperform gold.
NEUT28|And he's like look, you buy an ounce of gold.
NEUT29|100 years later, you still own.
NEUT30|Analysis of Golden monger even took a swipe once he said, I can't imagine a worse crowd to deal with and a bunch of gold bugs.
NEUT31|So my big inference here Adam, is that Buffett and Munger's that could have certainly changed their minds here on gold.
NEUT32|They've done that in the past where there's airline stocks or even getting into tech stocks like Apple, which is now the largest position.
NEUT33|Or it could be they have a bit more autonomy for those young investment deputies at Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.
NEUT34|Perhaps they were the ones that made that Buffett did reference in the past, or at least hit in the past set.
NEUT35|It was one of the young deputies that made the.
NEUT36|Initial Apple Investment will also note that of course back in the annual meeting this year he did.
BEAR37|It confirmed they exited the airline stocks.
NEUT38|You know they had once said they would never buy an airline stock again.
NEUT39|They made pretty big investments back in 2016.
NEUT40|Of course, dumping those, I had an interesting phone call Adam with a macro strategist about this that this could just be it.
NEUT41|You know, an expression for buffet or Berkshire on more of a macro trend here.
BEAR42|Not because they think that the dollar is going to get debased by any means.
NEUT43|And if you're going to play a macro, trend is gold.
NEUT44|In other words, if you don't want to own Treasurys 'cause they're unattractive because of the duration risk.
NEUT45|As we talked to.
NEUT46|Peter Bush about earlier you might play in a publicly traded Pretty liquid company like a big mining company like Barrick Gold.
NEUT47|And of course it's certainly not cheap.
NEUT48|It was great trading earlier 28 times.
NEUT49|So not really a value play but still very we're watching it.
NEUT50|Very interesting move.
