NEUT0|"""What's up guys, it's your boy will back on the video today."
NEUT1|Today we will be talking about Nano Dimension's ticker symbol and MDM.
NEUT2|I'll be giving you guys some key support and resistance levels and also this level that I told you guys to watch out for and look how it acted right at that level, right?
NEUT3|So make sure guys like the video hit that subscribe button to post vacation so you don't miss any updates on stocks.
NEUT4|And also check out my Patreon page down below if you want to know when I'm buying and selling so.
NEUT5|Earlier this week or last week.
NEUT6|I said this is a support level, right?
NEUT7|They opened up higher, premarket came down hit it shut up.
NEUT8|So this is still a support level.
BEAR9|I see if the stock does go want to go down but I think that this is a pretty far drop.
NEUT10|What percentage is this?
NEUT11|So?
BEAR12|That's like a 44% drop that is very deep, but I don't see any new support.
NEUT13|I'd nysia support around.
BULL14|13.3 like around here and as you can see and it bounced off that, but that was a quicker support and I have enough time to make a video on that support, but it did support that and shot higher quickly.
NEUT15|So like I told you guys just resistance level at 1698 or $17.00.
NEUT16|You guys want to have this on your chart because I thought if the price did go higher that was show some resistance and as you can see it did.
BEAR17|It came right there and drop came back up drop OK so it is down at the hours as well.
NEUT18|So now.
NEUT19|We need to see if it wants to breakthrough this level.
NEUT20|That will be very bullish.
BULL21|'cause right now it's like resistance, but if it breaks through that level then I think we could see prices well over $20.
NEUT22|Or it might want to come around that $20 mark and reject again.
BULL23|So if this passes through, washed their $20 mark up there, 'cause that would be another key level of resistance.
BULL24|But if it breaks through that, then very bullish Nano is getting a lot of traction with all the new stuff that they're doing.
NEUT25|And more people are getting their eye on them.
NEUT26|So I am pulling this longer term, but as you guys know I like to do longer term and short term place.
NEUT27|The longer term just sits and I write this in short term plays.
NEUT28|I'll get in, get out, get in, get out, stuff like that.
NEUT29|OK so support level 61.
NEUT30|1037 you can also have the support level as it was like 13.
NEUT31|You can also have 13.3 in your chart is like right here.
NEUT32|Somewhere it did bounce all this as a key support, but watch this resistance.
NEUT33|This will tell us if this bullish or bearish OK, if it starts to bring it through this that's bullish.
NEUT34|But if you start seeing it come down then that means it is bearish on the shirt.
NEUT35|Short term, OK?
NEUT36|So hope you guys like this video now.
