NEUT0|"""OK, so which?"
NEUT1|Which are the best pass?
BULL2|Because I know you pulled back from a lot of things.
NEUT3|Looks like medicines out growings out.
NEUT4|It's like New York is growing out.
NEUT5|You close in green houses but you've got new product.
NEUT6|You've got a breadth of product.
NEUT7|You've got some edibles.
NEUT8|Ann, you have drinks which are going to be the stores.
NEUT9|Well, look, I think the drinks are going to be something really special in in the reason that I would pick on drinks is that you know there are.
NEUT10|There's a large number of people that haven't tried cannabis but intend to.
NEUT11|In fact, in Canada, 17% of the adult population claims that they intend to try cannabis, but haven't in the last 12 months.
NEUT12|Those people are not going to enter the category by smoking, so we need to give them another reason to enter the category, and then when you when you look at our drinks, we can.
NEUT13|Make our drinks taste like literally anything that we want so we can meet the consumer need there.
NEUT14|We get an onset time of about 10 minutes, which is equivalent to a drink of alcohol.
NEUT15|We can have an effect that kind of equates to about a glass of wine or a beer, and we can do that Jim in a way that has 0 calories in zero carbs.
NEUT16|These things are outstanding in terms of the experience they give.
NEUT17|I think they're better than Seltzers and I can't wait to get them in more and more people's hands in Canada and then bring them to the US through our partner acreage as soon as we possibly Dave.
NEUT18|What this sounds like is this was the beauty of what I always loved.
NEUT19|About the deal.
NEUT20|I always thought we combine your sense about money and your abilities.
BULL21|Create taste with a product that is better than the old Miller Lite.
NEUT22|You know less filling, no filling, great taste.
NEUT23|So you're telling me this is happening and you know I'm going to use a term that we would use it doing alright at home.
NEUT24|You tell me you can get me a good buzz where I'll be fine not to drive I know that but a good buzz without calories.
NEUT25|And I'm telling you that I'm also saying that unlike unlike alcohol, where the effect of the buzz, if you will, is based upon maybe the mood you're in or or what you've eaten that day.
NEUT26|We can dial in that buzz a little bit when you're talking about cannabis, because we can give you a relaxing experience.
BULL27|We can give you an invigorating experience.
NEUT28|So there is a lot that we can do with this next generation set of cannabis products.
NEUT29|And that's why that's why early on, I'm spending money to get more and more consumer insights so that we know what's going to be necessary to bring.
NEUT30|Consumers into the category we already have.
NEUT31|What I believe is best in class science from the perspective of plant science formulation.
BULL32|In most importantly human effects, and I think we're going to be able to put these together and create quite a quite an amazing experience for our consumer set.
NEUT33|Don't miss a second of mad money.
