BULL0|"""Welcome back guys."
NEUT1|We are going to talk about Disney now.
NEUT2|Those of you who follow our our Discord channel.
NEUT3|The link is of course down below know that we were watching Disney all the way on Friday.
NEUT4|Every time we see a big run up we know what's going to happen.
NEUT5|It pops up on our customized scan and we know we have to take action.
NEUT6|We took action on Friday.
BULL7|Guys, we got some puts our call spreads going on Friday at a nice, you know one 75180 range.
NEUT8|And then look what happens after hours and into this morning Sunday night we had a strategy session at 9:00 PM.
NEUT9|We have one every Wednesday and every Sunday and we specifically talked about Disney.
NEUT10|We talked about how it's going to open, come back down, make another test.
BEAR11|Another high point which was the close of that of Friday didn't come back and hit support.
NEUT12|All that was discussed.
NEUT13|This is where we started buying our puts we bought.
NEUT14|We bought some 180 puts here.
NEUT15|We bought some 172 1/2 puts here.
NEUT16|As a matter fact, I threw in a 167 put as well.
NEUT17|In anticipation of the breakdown, now we know what we have to look for.
NEUT18|We have to look for a rejection.
NEUT19|Retest and then rejection and we didn't see that rejection happen, right?
NEUT20|So we were waiting patiently.
BEAR21|At this point we alerted the group if the stock goes over 122 five, we have to get rid of it.
NEUT22|Whatever your profit would everlost get rid of it be completely done.
NEUT23|It never did that right.
BULL24|It bounced right off of our resistance points and then towards the last 30 minutes of the day is where we saw it come back down and hit our goal.
NEUT25|So this was our daily goal for today.
BEAR26|We're expecting it to go down to 165 tomorrow.
NEUT27|Now it can happen after hours.
NEUT28|It can happen during the day.
NEUT29|But we're expecting a touch of 165 and you can even possibly go a little lower, but we're not going to take that much of a risk.
NEUT30|We have some naked puts.
NEUT31|There were going to get rid of tomorrow.
BULL32|We are up around 50 to 60% on all of our naked puts right now for Disney.
BULL33|For our call spread, we're already more than 50% recognized on those, so those were going to keep till the end of the week.
NEUT34|As long as Disney keeps coming down, will recognize full profit and there's 1000 bucks left to make on that one.
NEUT35|And then we're going to move on to something else.
NEUT36|If you follow our Discord channel, you'll get the most up-to-date watch list, and you'll get commentary.
NEUT37|For me, a live video every single evening on why I'm picking this talk.
NEUT38|What I'm going to do with it, and how the next day may turn out to be.
NEUT39|And of course, no matter what your skill level is, will walk you to the trade, whether it be just a call report or something a little more complex like a kostbar put, spread, or even Iron Condor.
