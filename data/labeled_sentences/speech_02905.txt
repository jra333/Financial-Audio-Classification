NEUT0|"""Is the electricity still in the air out in the Bay Area on the back of the Facebook IPO?"
NEUT1|I think nothing can deflate the optimism in Silicon Valley, right?
NEUT2|Yeah, that's not even not even an IPO that broke issue.
NEUT3|It doesn't matter.
NEUT4|People don't care about stuff like that.
NEUT5|All they care about is $100 billion and that companies with zero revenue like Instagram and Pinterest.
NEUT6|And companies that you've never heard of that people are talking about Silicon Valley are highly valued, right?
NEUT7|That's the only thing they care about.
NEUT8|So, so you're saying that all they care about is the money or all they care about is that is that there's still the hot **** next thing going.
NEUT9|I mean, I think the thing that really struck me about being in the Bay Area is that there is this sense of optimism and people don't really care, aren't really touched by discussions about worries in Europe or worries about the economy at large.
NEUT10|All they know is that there's lots of energy, enthusiasm, and startups fomenting in Silicon Valley in San Francisco.
NEUT11|I mean that it's just a different mindset.
NEUT12|Or is it?
NEUT13|Are they in effect living in a bubble?
NEUT14|Is this just a social media bubble, bubble 2.0 or whatever you want to call?
NEUT15|Think it's both.
NEUT16|I think the mentality is different and I think that they are living in a little bit of a bubble untouched by the rest of the troubles infecting the world in the country right now.
NEUT17|Do you believe by the time you head back home in San Francisco once the IPO broke issue price for this morning?
NEUT18|And I don't know where it's going to close, but let's assume that it doesn't close above 38 for some time to come.
NEUT19|Who knows, will do you think there will be a change in mentality or do you think people go out?
NEUT20|You know?
NEUT21|So what?
NEUT22|I think people will say.
BEAR23|So what I mean, nobody in San Francisco or in Silicon Valley is going to say Facebook is a failure because it broke through the IPO price.
NEUT24|I mean you know that this is just kind of a trading phenomenon where once it falls below 38 people just press sell out of habit.
NEUT25|I don't think that this Facebook isn't less valuable as a company today than it was a week ago or two weeks ago.
NEUT26|Even if the stock market value is less than.
NEUT27|Was on Friday.
BEAR28|Well, it is less valuable than it was.
NEUT29|I mean, that just in the wrong is wrong.
NEUT30|Numbers are in the wrong number.
NEUT31|You'd have a hard time proving to me that the thing was worth, you know, $38.00 a share to begin with.
NEUT32|But every question, it's a separate quick.
NEUT33|Let's talk about the San Francisco scene.
NEUT34|Yeah, the one that you are the part of right now.
NEUT35|Have you been using these various social media, Instagram, and Pinterest More since you moved out there?
NEUT36|Or do you feel like you still have a healthy?
NEUT37|Disregard or contempt for the social media phenomenon.
NEUT38|Well, I don't know if it's contempt.
NEUT39|I think it's just I'm too stupid and I have other things to do than to fixate on whatever hot startup is going on at that particular moment.
NEUT40|But I have tried some of these new things.
NEUT41|You know, Pinterest and path.
NEUT42|An Instagram and things that are, I'm probably too uncool to even know what they are, but I've tried to use some of them since I've been out there so I can at least know what people are talking about.
NEUT43|A cocktail party?
BEAR44|Yeah, and by the way, at Berman I had a fight with Berman about this very subject.
NEUT45|I asked him why do you use Facebook Berman?
NEUT46|We're showing some nice shots of the Golden Gate Bridge, which you know, nice.
NEUT47|You missed it.
NEUT48|I I had this always fogged in Burma was like.
NEUT49|Well Evan you you have to be doing this now if you want to know what's going on and I said no I don't.
NEUT50|I could still get away with reading old books and watching old movies and he said well maybe you can can you do that in San Francisco?
NEUT51|Still you really can't I just a short story that I think will upset my friends in Waterloo ON.
NEUT52|I'm probably the only person in the Bay Area who has a BlackBerry and it's really just embarrassing marker of my East Coast Ness that I don't have the latest and greatest gadgets but now you.
NEUT53|It is a badge of pride.
NEUT54|I do a little bit.
NEUT55|It's my sign of backwardness.
NEUT56|Share a old school.
BULL57|Not sure we gotta run but thank you very much for joining my pleasure.
NEUT58|"I mean St."""
