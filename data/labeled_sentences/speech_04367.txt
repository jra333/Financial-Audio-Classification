BULL0|"""Hello and welcome in this new video."
NEUT1|Today we're going to see the Jaguar Health Inc. Stock chart analysis for April 2021.
NEUT2|So this is the first video of April and we're very bullish for the stocks that we are going to present today.
NEUT3|So if you feel confident, Please remember to smash the like and subscribe button to the channel and let's get straight into it.
NEUT4|Those are my positions at the moment.
NEUT5|I have $100 invested into Jaguar, but I'm planning to invest more if this is gonna deep even further and I am not rushing in investing so I'm not chasing the stock.
NEUT6|Is something that I don't advise you to do either.
NEUT7|We can see here on the chart we did already 3 episodes, so feel free to check out the channel for other stocks as well and many other information that could be useful for the long term.
NEUT8|So we have this buying channel right here that I consider buying channel.
NEUT9|I wasn't able to buy there unfortunately, but they both want the Java stock hit this channel right here.
NEUT10|So now we're seeing that we had a rejection.
BULL11|On the last day of trading Friday and I think this is gonna go up, up, up and will try to test the bottom of the channel that is above the 100 day moving average.
NEUT12|Why is this important?
NEUT13|Because if we are going to break the one under the moving average and then consolidate above the 200 day moving average that is just below.
NEUT14|So break the 100 and then consolidate about the 200 and then go to break this channel.
NEUT15|We could see Jagger back to the three $4 sooner than you expect, so we can see also that this W pattern right here is forming as we were talking last week and.
NEUT16|In my opinion, this is very bullish.
NEUT17|I do consider that Jumper could reach in 2023, so in two years time, $20 per share.
NEUT18|So that's a 10X from the price that is trading.
BULL19|Right now I'm planning to keep adding to my position and to keep averaging up while it starts climbing to $3.00 in the case is gonna go to have a bull run and then sell about $4.
NEUT20|This non financial advisory just might.
NEUT21|Plan for how to trade the stock of Jaguar and I'm planning to add positions all the way from here to this spot right here and then sell them above this resistance that we have around $3 so I will add positions here that have profit potential of 50%.
NEUT22|Then positions here that have profit potential of 20% and finally positions for the long term.
NEUT23|Obviously when Jaguar reaches this channel.
NEUT24|For the actual 2023 slash forward 480% and more only if this reaches the all time high and if this reaches highs of.
NEUT25|More for example.
NEUT26|$8.00, Let's say we have already 400% profit.
NEUT27|So imagine this reaching $20.
BULL28|That's a pretty good pretty good deal in my opinion.
NEUT29|So this is our stuff stock.
NEUT30|Health Inc. Is the analysis from a data analyst point of view.
