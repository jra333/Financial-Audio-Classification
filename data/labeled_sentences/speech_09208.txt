NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video we'll be talking about BlackBerry stock ticker symbol BB and give you guys some BB analysts and also some stock predictions and also the one key level only.
NEUT4|I am looking to buy.
NEUT5|And the exit that I'm looking to exit the play at.
NEUT6|It will be a shorter term play, like less than a week.
NEUT7|It just depends on how long it takes to go from the entry so that exit.
NEUT8|But assuming less than a week, OK?
NEUT9|So let's get into it.
BULL10|Hope you guys like the video.
NEUT11|Leave a like subscribe and also turn publications so you don't miss any updates now.
NEUT12|Or resistance level as persons coming down let me zoom in.
NEUT13|As prices coming down.
BULL14|I see a resistance level.
NEUT15|And this will also be the exit from my entry.
NEUT16|OK 11:15.
NEUT17|Little bit so 11:15 will be my resistance level.
NEUT18|And this will also be my exit from my entry.
NEUT19|This would be my exit level and then my entry level would be $9.85.
NEUT20|OK when I zoom in it doesn't show that level so from $9.80.
BULL21|$9.85 2 So that's about a 12% gain.
BULL22|I'll be looking for a 10% gain and I'll get out the play.
BULL23|OK, so I'm looking for a nice 10% scalp in between here, but for this to go well it would need to open up and start raining down and hit this level.
BEAR24|OK, it did close around 1071 and it is down a little bit after hours so I do want it to hit this level during normal hours.
BEAR25|OK, I do think we will see some buying pressure off this level.
NEUT26|OK, but if it opens up and starts going higher then watch this resistance.
BEAR27|If it breaks it starts applying pressure that we could look for a new entry.
NEUT28|OK, but if it holds this resistance level and comes down, this is where I'll be looking to get shares at for the shorter term play and this will be my exit.
NEUT29|OK as you can tell BlackBerry and really hasn't moved any right?
NEUT30|This is March 10th, OK the Open was 1101.
NEUT31|So 123456789 days and look where it closed at 1070 so it only moved about $0.30 right?
NEUT32|Hasn't moved a lot, but I'm trying to get a type of play like this, right?
NEUT33|I think one day it will have a little pop and I think it will be at this level so just watch this level and this is really the only level I'm looking at at 985 to buy shares at.
