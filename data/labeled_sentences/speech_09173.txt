NEUT0|"""I want to end on Bitcoin."
NEUT1|Here we talk a lot about the fundamentals of Bitcoin.
NEUT2|You sort of look into technical indicators of Bitcoin, which will be kind of revolutionary for the market.
NEUT3|Walk us through it OK, back in 2017 we were encouraged that we had and monitor the Bitcoin market, but there wasn't much data.
NEUT4|You know it was in its infancy and the data wasn't.
NEUT5|It was really unchartered data or uncharted data.
NEUT6|In fact there wasn't much reservoir of data.
NEUT7|But once we started following that, we followed it closely and we applied the same.
NEUT8|Approach with the Nines and 13th and lo and behold, December 18th.
NEUT9|The exact day of the high.
NEUT10|Was a 13 so we thought that was just a chance event.
NEUT11|It won't happen again.
NEUT12|But then on December 14th the exact date of the lower recorded a 13th and that you know goes from from profit from a chance or coincidence into something with a higher probability and then in June of this year on June 17th we got what we call a misfire or early 13 but a week and a half later on the June 26 high we saw another 13.
NEUT13|So what's happened?
NEUT14|Three out of the four occasions.
NEUT15|They've been the precise, the Hyatt top and bottom, and then on the client that we had in in September.
BEAR16|A number of people who use our indicators but really abuse them and misuse and call the market bottom, which was wrong because the nine set up should have been perfected and it wasn't perfected until they had a little.
BULL17|We got a 2300 point rally.
BEAR18|Since then, the market traded lower, which we're expecting, and currently we're on a date countdown and the risk downside is quite a bit from here.
BEAR19|Even from here we've got a downside.
BEAR20|Projection is 6308 minimum, and in a crash decline in this market we go to 5294.
NEUT21|We've been speaking to a Thomas Lee who would be considered the authority on crypto currencies.
NEUT22|Bitcoin and he's got the fundamentals and he said there's really there's nothing available as far as timing markets, and that's what we're trying to do is coordinate combined.
BULL23|Fundamental in that market timing and hopefully will unlock this market.
BULL24|"It's responded very well, just like our indicators did back in the 70s, so we'll keep you updated and hopefully you'll have us on the air when we recorded 13."""
