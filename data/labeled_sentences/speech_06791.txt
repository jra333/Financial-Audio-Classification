NEUT3|So let's begin in this video.
NEUT4|I will answer the common questions.
NEUT5|Should I invest in Tesla stock?
NEUT6|Should I trade Tesla stock?
NEUT7|What is the Tesla stock price production?
NEUT8|All of that will be answered in this video.
BULL9|So Tesla shares rocketed higher Tuesday following the news that the electric automaker is joining the SP 500.
BEAR10|On Tuesday, at their highest price in the month of November and awaken the tree, they lose and strike.
BULL11|Sell the shares, climbed as much as 13% before closing up at 8%.
NEUT12|Profits for the day.
NEUT13|The company will join the SP 500 next month and it will be the biggest company to join the SP 500 Index in decades.
NEUT14|Workers hatchway was the largest company to join the SP 500 at $189 billion in market cap in 2010 and then time Tesla will be the 9th largest company in the index by market cap based on its market cap that worth more than $420 billion.
BEAR15|The reason that will make the stock skyrocket is in a major index typically sets off a scramble among investors.
NEUT16|To buy shares of the newly added company.
NEUT17|Because many investment funds are designed to measure the index exactly and the SP 500 is one of the most widely followed measures of the performance of the American stock market with more than $11 trillion worth of mutual funds and other investment measures against an index that includes more than $4.5 trillion, an index fund investment.
NEUT18|The second reason that will make the stock explode as the $25,000 car.
BULL19|The most affordable car ever tested, made and last but not least, analysis estimates and earnings increase in this quarter of $0.55 per share.
NEUT20|All of these previous reasons I believe that will cause the stock to skyrocket again, so that was this for this video.
BULL21|Hope you like it.
