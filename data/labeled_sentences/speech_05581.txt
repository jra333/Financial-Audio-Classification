NEUT0|"""She not a lot of people's minds."
NEUT1|How long will this outbreak lasted?
NEUT2|How long will we be under orders to stay at home?
NEUT3|Stacy Smith spoke with PNC's top economists about that and how long it might take for the economy to bounce back.
BEAR4|It's going to be millions of people who lose their jobs and and you know it.
BEAR5|It's still unclear at this point exactly how bad it's going to be.
NEUT6|Gospel Shane, the chief economist at PNC, also says the key to getting people back to work and reviving the economy rests with one basic question.
BEAR7|The key question is, how long are people laid off?
BEAR8|Is this the kind of thing where people are out of work for a couple of months?
BEAR9|But then businesses restart again and rehire their employees, in which case the damage will be pretty bad, but the stimulus will help make up for that.
BEAR10|Or is it going to be the the situation or we see a lot of businesses closed permanently?
BEAR11|Those people lose their jobs permanently.
BEAR12|That means a longer recession.
BEAR13|It means a weaker recovery.
BEAR14|And it means that those job losses become permanent and so it's a much greater impact on individuals in the economy.
BULL15|Faucher says that if the social distancing orders are relaxed, the government stimulus package should help kick start the economy.
NEUT16|But the hope is, is that between the stimulus checks that individuals who beginning the aid to businesses, all of that.
BULL17|By the time things gradually returned to normal, that people will have enough money to go out and spend, and then we could see a pretty strong recovery from this.
BULL18|Thanks in large part to the stimulus that we will be receiving, but Foshay cautions that if we are still at home three or four months from now, we might not see a recovery until late this year or into next year.
