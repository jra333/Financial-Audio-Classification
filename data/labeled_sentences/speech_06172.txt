NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Charter Communications ranges between $0.15 per share and negative $15.09 per share."
NEUT1|However, those values calculated paying $0.15 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
BEAR2|They have $0.15 in cash and cash equivalents pretty low.
NEUT3|How about this value here?
NEUT4|So as opposed to paying anything, the calculation is suggesting that in fact Charter Communications would have to pay us $15.09 per share in order to make the deal happen.
NEUT5|Now the reason why this is happening is simply a function of the calculation itself.
NEUT6|Remember that the calculation for high end for intrinsic value, according to Benjamin Graham and Securities Analysis is earnings times 20 divided by the outstanding shares.
BEAR7|So the reason we're getting a negative value here is because the net profit.
BEAR8|Over the last 10 years, the median net profit number that I use is negative, so it's negative $169 million.
BULL9|Now, even though they've been in somewhat of a wonky uptrend, at least at the very least, their earnings have been positive in the last four years.
BEAR10|The fact that they were negative in other years is, well, it's a red flag.
NEUT11|So how much are they trading at now?
NEUT12|Well, Charter Communications, AKA spectrum.
NEUT13|Is trading at $593.68, which doesn't appear all that justified and take a look at the PE ratio down here.
NEUT14|It's at 4698 which is huge.
NEUT15|Benjamin Graham suggests anything above 20 is, well.
NEUT16|You should look at for an alternative.
NEUT17|An alternative investment vehicle.
NEUT18|And that's what we'll do now, so we'll turn to an investment vehicle that offers a similar return to a stock common stock with similar risk while maintaining safety of principle and.
NEUT19|And ample margin of safety so well, that fund is the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT20|So that's where we would place our money as opposed to Charter Communications.
BULL21|And we would do that until they start posting some positive earnings.
NEUT22|So they need at least a 10 year trend of positive and growing earnings, not this wonky stuff before we're willing to take a second glance and maybe start some deeper fundamental analysis so.
