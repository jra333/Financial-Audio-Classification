NEUT0|"""Now we have ownership from Digas Anjo Digas lot of upside left here, you think?"
BEAR1|Definitely not upside.
NEUT2|We like it at these levels.
BULL3|Positive outlook.
BULL4|We're seeing about a 15 to 20% gain from here.
NEUT5|It's around $60.00.
BULL6|We can easily see this getting to $70.00 because the fact of the valuation the operating cash flow yield is about 30% so.
BULL7|So a lot of upside here.
BULL8|The profitability as measured by cash flow to return on invested capital is around 20%.
NEUT9|The forward expectations.
BULL10|They're actually investing about $27 billion in next Gen TV, and we see this as a definitely positive.
BULL11|Also, they have a partnership with their autonomous vehicle to work with Microsoft using the Azure platform for the autonomous vehicle software, so we see a lot of upside to General Motors at these levels.
BULL12|Yeah, Joe are being better late than never for you right in GM.
NEUT13|Yes, certainly I'm one of the last on the show to get into GM, but I'm OK with that.
NEUT14|I believe in buying high and selling higher, higher as digas rightly dis yeah, and the story is digas rightly describes it.
NEUT15|It is a very positive one and it's a secular story and there's clear policy support in this country for ivys you're seeing higher gas prices, lower battery prices, and you're talking about a company that's really done a good job in terms of guiding what their balance sheet is going to look like.
NEUT16|Digges talked about the free cash flow, what the expectations are there, what the cap ex is going to be, but they've already guided forward what their corporate tax rate is going to look like at 24% under the new corporate tax structure.
BULL17|So I think this company is really getting ahead of both the balance sheet management and the introduction into ivys 30 vehicles by 2025, fully EV by 2035.
NEUT18|I don't know, certainly.
NEUT19|It seems to me that they are positioned to take some market share from Tesla, which I know is very, very complicated and controversial.
BULL20|I would hope so if the stocks had double this year, right?
BULL21|Yeah, I mean it's up 230% / 1 year and it's up.
BULL22|"It's a double year to date so I'm just wondering, OK, thank you very much for this call."""
