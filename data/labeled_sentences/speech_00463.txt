BULL0|"""Congratulations for getting this back out the door."
NEUT1|Well, thank you.
NEUT2|It's good to be here so you have two years plus really sort of an unlimited amount of time.
NEUT3|What are you looking for in a company that you might want to go public with or merge with?
NEUT4|But what we're looking for?
NEUT5|I mean, obviously we're in the restaurant segment, so we're very focused on that, and we actually prefer more of the QSR or fast casual area of the of that segment.
BULL6|What we're looking for is a good brand that we can make great.
NEUT7|And how do you do that?
BULL8|You do that by making the brand stronger, more relevant, resonating more with the consumer, more product driven, culinary focused more technology application, and that's really key today.
BULL9|Along with branding and then of course, be able to fold in operations and a great great talent team.
NEUT10|To for real estate for future growth.
NEUT11|Now Sandy, I'm curious.
NEUT12|Now that you've got this back launched, you have a short list in terms of opportunities.
NEUT13|I mean, you're welcome to share those names with us if you like understand.
NEUT14|Maybe if you don't want to, but Are you ready to execute and in short order?
NEUT15|We are.
NEUT16|We do have a short list for about 100 down to current, about 10.
NEUT17|We have.
NEUT18|We're going to put it away after about 3:00 at a time as Susan arrested, we're pretty agnostic as to who in the 10 we get.
BULL19|We think all of them could be good, could be made great and we look forward to the journey on that, but we plan you know we'd like to move fast, not slow so Sunday you know.
NEUT20|Obviously Ruby Tuesday.
BULL21|Great success.
BULL22|You know you have proven your mettle in this industry, but at the same time.
NEUT23|You know all of those that you mentioned.
NEUT24|If you're agnostic as to which one, that means they're all doing a good enough job, right?
NEUT25|Or there are things that you see in each one of them that you think you could shine up like a diamond.
NEUT26|Let's say what would attract you or them to you if you like, why?
NEUT27|Why should they pick you?
NEUT28|Well, I think I think one it could be if it's a.
NEUT29|If it's an entrepreneur or owner, operator, family operated.
NEUT30|Let's say more likely.
NEUT31|Maybe they'd like to be public.
NEUT32|Maybe they'd like to hedge their risks on so.
BULL33|Merging with us in form of public company could be a great benefit to them, minimize their risk.
BULL34|But in addition to that you get a great team.
NEUT35|I mean, our team, we've we've run fast, casual brands.
NEUT36|We've run full service brands large $2 billion companies, you know, billion dollar companies international domestic.
NEUT37|Small, whatever we've done it at all.
NEUT38|So I think that we have.
BULL39|We have some wisdom and we could help smaller company in that half billion debate and half dollar range quite a bit.
NEUT40|Then if you could move to private equity funds, you know there you know these.
NEUT41|These are challenging times.
NEUT42|There are some funds to have their time limits.
NEUT43|Of course an it's just might be the right time to have a transaction.
BULL44|"So there's different reasons for different folks, but we believe that there we think will be a positive to either group."""
