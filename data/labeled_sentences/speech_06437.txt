BULL0|"""Welcome back so 19 to focus 2020."
NEUT1|When is the the Today after week?
NEUT2|So we are at #30 synthetics.
NEUT3|Never token Weber ticker SNX so for SNX against very easy.
NEUT4|OK, I don't know is this the top?
NEUT5|There's no clear reversal.
NEUT6|Chop it and we don't see any clear reversals yet.
NEUT7|There's no bearish candle sticks, not bearish, engulfing there is no shooting stars.
NEUT8|There's no hidden shoulders, there's no dissension yet, so this is not a reversal, not yet.
NEUT9|It might morph into a reversal, but right now there's nothing much happening for synthetics against BTC.
BEAR10|We're in some sort of a correction.
NEUT11|I don't know how much longer we're going to correct.
NEUT12|Obviously everything follows behind.
BEAR13|Bitcoin false, obviously.
NEUT14|Synthetics is going to fall as well, so right now I'm not exactly sure what the wheels of synthetics are trying to do, so we're just going to be very patient and we're going to wait for the synthetic skills to give us a higher quality chapter first before we do anything.
NEUT15|Alright, so as we want to synthetics against USD T, But before that please Chris video like if enjoyed it.
NEUT16|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think in the comments below.
BULL17|So far.
BEAR18|Synthetix network token against USD.
NEUT19|T yeah, it seems to me for the past four days.
BEAR20|Things have been falling lower if you look at the Magdi again, you can see that the histogram again is ticking lower and lower and lower and lower and lower, so there's also potential data.
NEUT21|Crossover could be happening for synthetics against USD.
NEUT22|There could be a very clear crossover coming in so.
NEUT23|Be very careful right?
NEUT24|Be very, very careful.
NEUT25|I'm not saying you can't go any higher, you know we already at where we $7.40.
NEUT26|We still might.
NEUT27|You know, perform a.
NEUT28|You turn back towards the upside and hit $10.
NEUT29|Yeah, we could still do that, but at this point of time.
NEUT30|I think we should be staying safe and I'll be waiting for a clear chop it in first year, but synthetics has been very, very untradeable very untradeable in the beginning it was tradeable after that.
NEUT31|Yeah, just lots it.
BEAR32|Just lossed.
NEUT33|It's tradability and you just went higher and higher after that.
NEUT34|2128 cents.
NEUT35|Yeah and he just went parabolic so it's crazy.
NEUT36|This defy crisis is D5 bubble will pop eventually one fine day so be very very careful and always secure your.
