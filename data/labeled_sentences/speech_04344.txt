NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my carnal dear Co-founder Patrick Partners on the Power BI Chino."
BEAR1|So check it on Amazon, which came down.
BEAR2|We had a projective levels where we're watching for reversal down at 1491, got down to 1476, and then strongly reversed back in the rotation zone, returning it to the 208 simple moving average.
NEUT3|So just one before I updated those levels, just wanted to show you where it returned to and also the 37 and a half percent retracement.
NEUT4|If we get any further rally next level of will be watching for is around 1725 and if we get through there then we'll be watching for a 50% retracement from this whole sell off which is 1763.
NEUT5|Those are key resistance levels.
NEUT6|If we break back down 1st, next level of support is about 1620 then below that 1548, so I'll call it 1550.
NEUT7|Let's check in on that daily chart.
BEAR8|Now the rotation zone is against us on the daily.
NEUT9|So let's go to weekly Chart weekly chart.
NEUT10|We might be getting the first cross of the rotation zone, so that's major area.
BEAR11|That's pretty negative right now for Amazon, unless it can get a very strong rally above about 1800 again, so that's what we'll be watching.
NEUT12|Or but we're not going to be in bullish mode until we can get back above 1800 or less.
BULL13|We get a very, very strong bottoming pattern.
BEAR14|You can see it did dip below the 50 week exponential moving average, and we got a strong reversal back up here.
NEUT15|So start watching for next week to see if we can get a key close above this 1691.
NEUT16|So we'll call it essentially the 1700 level.
NEUT17|That's what we're watching for on Amazon.
NEUT18|And it also did trigger this small double top that was triggered a couple weeks ago, and it did go to full target so.
NEUT19|That's about the latest on Amazon, so we're just being patient either waiting for a very strong bottoming pattern or back above 1800.
NEUT20|And then we'll start looking to buy any pullbacks again.
BEAR21|"But the rotation zone is against us on the daily, so that is holding us back for now."""
