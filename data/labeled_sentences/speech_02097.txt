NEUT2|And, of course, this is a direct aim at Facebook, which has been under pressure because of this flow of advertisers.
NEUT3|Deciding to support this boycott Tim.
BULL4|That is extraordinary.
BEAR5|Wow, the follow through here and again you know, give credit to the early stage advertisers, but when I hear this I think I know it's very difficult time for AD dollars in every media company is assessing that and going through potentially a painful time.
NEUT6|Although if you listen to Facebook and their Q1 numbers, that was the extraordinary thing you really haven't seen in effect.
NEUT7|But there are other options.
NEUT8|There are other media companies that are hearing this news.

NEUT12|Singling out social media as being a wild.
NEUT13|Maybe an untethered environment of uncertainty in terms of the messaging appetizers.

NEUT28|I mean, you know, companies like Coca Cola and Hershey.
NEUT29|This is it.
NEUT30|You as a corporate board member as a CEO, cannot cannot continue on.
NEUT31|You have to go along.
BEAR32|Reminds me of when Apple closed their stores for Covid.
