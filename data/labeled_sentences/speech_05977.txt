NEUT0|"""Like Bossy or folks that are going to be talking stock market margin debt, the New York Stock Exchange recently updated its stock market margin, debt data and Main Street and Wall Street are continuing to dump billions of dollars borrowed dollars, that is into the stock market."
NEUT1|Before we jump into the numbers that I wanted to kind of explain what exactly margin debt is, well put simply, basically it alone, an investor would take out to invest money in the stock market.
NEUT2|So they're investing borrowed money would be like going down to your bank, getting a loan for $1000 and investing that money hoping you would make more money than $1000 you invest.
BULL3|This leverages your return, so you can make a lot more money if your investments go up.
BEAR4|Unfortunately, you can also lose a lot more money than you have if your investments go down.
NEUT5|You know if you lose money on borrowed money, you still have to pay that money back, so it's kind of a double edged sword.
BEAR6|This debt generally rises as the market rises and speculators chase returns and therefore decreases as the markets fall.
BEAR7|Speculators get spooked, sell off their margin debt Holdings, and close those margin accounts.
NEUT8|But when we want to look at the data here, I made this chart for you.
BULL9|So we can see here borrowed money in the stock market known as margin debt hit an all time high of $412.45 billion in October.
NEUT10|As you can see on the far right side of the graph there.
NEUT11|But keep in mind that's unadjusted for inflation.
NEUT12|When we adjust this for inflation were around 7% below levels seen during the housing bubble that I've called out right there for you.
BULL13|And looking forward, it looks like you could see margin debt go up a little bit.
NEUT14|You know predictions are foolhardy, but one could assume with the low interest rates were seen in today's environment.
BEAR15|Debt could potentially go a lot higher than past records, 'cause it's so cheap to take out.
NEUT16|This dip history shows us that this is typical market behavior when you have big name companies like Micron Technology, Netflix, Tesla Motors, all rising more than 100% a year in the S&P 500.
BULL17|Also hitting all time highs from day to day, month to month.
NEUT18|So although this shouldn't be used as a timing mechanism folks, you shouldn't look at margin debt data and say Oh my goodness, I need to sell off my important my entire portfolio.
BEAR19|That would be bad advice.
BULL20|In my opinion, I used it as a warning sign that the overall market could be a bit overvalued and propped up by additional shared demand created from this borrowed money that's flowing into the market.
NEUT21|I always have my wish list ready of great companies.
NEUT22|I'd like to own on a sell off that I'd like to double down in, and I'm also always ready to step up my IR a contributions as a percentage of my income if the market does sell off.
NEUT23|Remember, as Warren Buffett says, we always want to be grateful, greedy when others are fearful.
NEUT24|That's what you want to do, folks.
NEUT25|That's how you can win in the long term.
