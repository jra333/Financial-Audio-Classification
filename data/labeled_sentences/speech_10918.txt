BULL0|"""So we are just climbing a little bit while she was speaking up to 1:30 on the Dow points are which is near the session highs."
BEAR1|Some Reddit users are turning their attention to pot stocks, sending shares of Tilray.
NEUT2|Another kind of his name's Soaring Today Tour is at 44%, joining us now Sean Stiefel, our CEO of Navy Capital.
NEUT3|His firm manages approximately $375 million in cannabis focused strategies.
BULL4|Thanks so much for joining us, Sean.
BULL5|Good to see.
BULL6|Thank you very much.
NEUT7|So I was reading some of your recent notes saying that Reddit traders are right on the pot thesis but wrong on the exposures they're getting, particularly of this of this last latest leg higher.
NEUT8|What?
NEUT9|Why do you say that?
NEUT10|Because what they're buying today are Canadian licensed producers that have little or no exposure in the United States, but you want to be buying or the actual operators here or benefiting from all of the federal changes in the state by state.
BEAR11|Legalization were very excited about the opportunity for US cannabis operators and every day that goes by, it's going to be harder and harder for Canadian LP's to establish a foothold here.
NEUT12|So how wrong?
NEUT13|Perhaps, if they got it with their stock exposures like the Canadian names you mentioned, wrong enough that you want to short those names, or just.
NEUT14|Focus on others.
NEUT15|I think in this day and age it happens.
BEAR16|Everyone knows is very dangerous to shore.
NEUT17|We wanna basket of puts on some of these names.
NEUT18|But in general we believe that you want to put your money in US operators and not be buying and chasing his Canadian LP's that are trading at insane valuations.
BEAR19|If those Canadian names do pull back, do you think your US names will suffer as well?
NEUT20|Providing a good entry opportunity to them and which are some of the names your long and you like?
BEAR21|Yeah so today you saw a little bit of a pullback earlier in the day and you just saw a wall of money.
NEUT22|Coming into the space, I think what you're seeing and you saw this with Green Thumb industries.
NEUT23|Yesterday you're seeing huge amounts of institutional capital.
BULL24|Comment to cannabis compliance officers are more comfortable with it and we believe companies like Green Thumb, Trulieve, Curaleaf, Cresco Labs, Jewish gene, which are extremely well positioned as states like Virginia, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, all of which are starting to legalization process in these kind of companies that are actually going to benefit as opposed to the Canadian LP's where?
NEUT25|You're just buying some hope that somehow someway they're going to find a way into the United States.
NEUT26|But is that all you're buying?
NEUT27|Because firstly, am I wrong in saying that these names do have some exposure in the US orbit?
NEUT28|Maybe it's not as big as some of the US names, but they're also part of a trend of growing legalization potentially in places like Europe too.
NEUT29|Yeah, and just for perspective, the European market this year will be shocked if it hits 100,000,000 and THC sales U.S. market this year could hit 30 billion, so there's not a lot of skin in the game.
NEUT30|Kind of outside the United States.
NEUT31|Yes, some of them like Canopy do have exposure in the US, but it's the minimas compared to operators like Green Thumb industries that have that will have hundreds of stores and it doesn't.
NEUT32|Plus states, that's where we want to play.
NEUT33|And those are the companies that are positioned as more and more states legalize.
BULL34|Sean, thanks so much for joining us.
BULL35|Thank you, Bradley.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
