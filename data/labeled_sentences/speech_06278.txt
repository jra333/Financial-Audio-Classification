NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, a rough day here in a very rough close and sits up for a very interesting weekend.
NEUT4|In terms of, you know, just how much more bearishness is going to show.
NEUT5|Maybe this will correct itself and it will turn out to be really nothing.
NEUT6|But before we get to late day action today, let's just set up the overall context that very clearly over the past couple of days there's been selling pressure.
NEUT7|Now I get it me just saying, selling pressure.
NEUT8|Those are just words, but that's the great thing about charts and why I love him.
NEUT9|They allow you to take words and phrases and then make them more visual.
NEUT10|So when I say selling pressure, what I mean is this resistance trendline?
NEUT11|Right there, which you can see is then a very respectable job of showing that every time the prices bounced each of these balances just keeps getting lower and lower.
NEUT12|So that represents, you know, the general selling pressure that we knew was already in there even before the late Day action, and then the Late Day action happened today.
NEUT13|And of course being Friday going into the weekend was basically the price going straight down.
NEUT14|And what's now very gonna interesting.
BEAR15|His cat is the price going to breakdown through that level right there at the 3098 mark.
NEUT16|You can see this is a pretty historic level.
NEUT17|I mean, you can see right there.
NEUT18|Generally speaking acted as support, right there acted as support and then the price is basically sitting right here, so there's going to be all sorts of people watching that level.
NEUT19|And I make that comment about all sorts of people because when you have lots of people watching the same areas and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy called whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT20|And that is exactly what's going on right here.
NEUT21|Nothing is guaranteed.
NEUT22|But my point here is that it's more than plausible.
BEAR23|It's more than you know, realistic to think that the price does get down there and break through that area that break in and of itself could create quite a bit of downward selling pressure, which you know realistically could very well carry this thing all the way down to.
NEUT24|You know the thirty 3080 Mark, if not even lower than that.
BEAR25|So yeah, we already knew there was selling pressure.
BEAR26|Now there is that selling pressure accelerated.
NEUT27|So is the price going?
NEUT28|Alternately breakdown below these areas it will be a very interesting Monday, so we'll see how this all plays out.
NEUT29|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL33|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
