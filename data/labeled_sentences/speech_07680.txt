BULL0|"""Hey, how you doing?"
NEUT1|I'm Eric Schlein from Larchmont, NY.
NEUT2|This is actually a follow-up question from a question that I asked last year at the meeting.
NEUT3|I asked you guys you know what you would do with a small sums of money.
NEUT4|Since you know I run a small portfolio under $1,000,000.
NEUT5|And you know, I asked you if you be doing things you know, like the net Nets that Benjamin Graham used to talk about an you know liquidation arbitrage.
NEUT6|You know a lot of the things that used to do in the buffet partnership and you acknowledged that you wouldn't be just to buy and hold investor that you basically are today.
NEUT7|But we'd be doing a lot of those transactions.
NEUT8|And Mr. Buffett, you also talked about how a lot of the investments you would do with under $1,000,000 would have nothing to do with stocks and would be with other types of securities.
NEUT9|And you're really not elaborate.
NEUT10|Neither of you really elaborated.
NEUT11|Anymore than that, so I guess I was wondering if you could elaborate a little more little bit more on how your investment strategy.
NEUT12|You know back then.
NEUT13|You know in reference to non stock investments would be different than your buy and hold strategy today.
NEUT14|So what kind of stuff would you be doing?
NEUT15|Maybe you can give me a past example that you did in the 50s and 60s that would be great.
NEUT16|Thank you.
NEUT17|Appreciate it well.
NEUT18|If I were working with small sums of money and I would be happy doing that.
NEUT19|The.
NEUT20|It would just open up.
NEUT21|Thousands of possibilities to man.
NEUT22|You might very well, certainly we found.
BEAR23|Very mispriced.
NEUT24|Bond switch where we could.
NEUT25|Come nowhere near buying a position of enough size in Berkshire to make a difference, but.
NEUT26|Where it would have made a difference if you were working with $1,000,000 but.
NEUT27|It would be bonds.
NEUT28|It would be.
NEUT29|It would be stocks of.
NEUT30|Both in the United States and elsewhere, we found him in Korea a few years ago that were ridiculously cheap.
NEUT31|You know, you basically had to make very significant returns, but you couldn't put big money out in it, so it could be in stocks that could be in.
NEUT32|Bonds wouldn't be in currencies with small amounts.
NEUT33|But you know, I had a friend who used to buy tax liens.
NEUT34|You know Tom, now he's got some relatives here and an enterprising person can find a lot of different ways of making money.
NEUT35|You'll find them, most of them will be in small stocks if you're working small money, they'll be in small stocks or in some specialized bond situations.
NEUT36|"Would you say that Charlie, sure?"""
