BULL0|"""Just want to point out one other metric here for Coke, which is organic revenue growth really important for consumer staples, much stronger than expected up 5%."
BEAR1|The estimates were around 2.7% and this is the outperformance that investors really like from Coca Cola and its new CEO James Quincy right now.
BEAR2|That's why the stock is outperformed up almost 20% over the last 12 months, way outperforming some of the other staples.
BEAR3|Now the weak spot in this report is actually the guidance.
NEUT4|The earnings outlook 208 the Street was looking for 223 so I just talked to James Quincy.
NEUT5|The CEO got a little color on that.
BEAR6|He said our biggest headwind.
NEUT7|Looking out right now is currency.
BEAR8|The dollar has moved against them.
BULL9|Strong dollar really started to make an impact on earnings this quarter and will continue to do so if we stay at these levels.
BEAR10|Quincy also told me generally we expect less growth in 2019 and 2018 because of macro.
NEUT11|He said the dynamic looks it looks a little more dynamic right now.
BEAR12|If you look at the global economy, they're seeing particular weakness there.
NEUT13|In Argentina, for instance, he did say that Diet Coke.
BULL14|I know Joe, that you'd be interested in this, did very well again in the quarter.
NEUT15|Zero.
NEUT16|I mean, they've revitalized Diet Coke.
BULL17|It pretty much had a flat year after shrinking for the last several years, thanks in part to the new flavors and they're rolling out a few others this year, including Blueberry Acai E oh sorry.
BULL18|They also, by the way, put in a new flavor for Brand Coke for the first time in 10 years.
NEUT19|Do you see this that the sort of vanilla orange flavor supposed to bring you back to the dreamsicle people of a certain age, but more like a vanilla count?
NEUT20|Or remember that was weather with root beer, but people use coated with ice cream.
BULL21|Yeah, yeah.
BULL22|Anyway, they're trying to compete against La Croix and all these sparkling water flavors which are growing so fast and bring a little more excitement to brand Coca Cola diet Coca.
NEUT23|Coca Cola, the other theme.
BEAR24|I would say of the quarter just to point out is that pricing went up there raising prices like a lot of other consumer companies to pass on higher costs, whether it's in freight or you know materials and so that was a big story as to why pricing was strong this quarter, but volumes were a little bit weaker, especially in North America.
BEAR25|In terms of this decline of 1.6%, it's the outlook.
BEAR26|It's the currency headwind, they said six or 7% headwind.
BULL27|That's a big head with operating income in 2019.
NEUT28|Correct?
NEUT29|Yeah, that's pretty much what it is.
NEUT30|An volume was a little life, but that was because of.
BEAR31|"The pricing also it's been an outperformer."""
