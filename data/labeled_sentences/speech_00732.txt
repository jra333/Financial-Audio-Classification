NEUT0|"""Call it yeah."
BULL1|We're going to say it, call it the icon rally, a pair of tweets from activist investor Carl Icahn sparked an 11% rally in Apple shares last week.
BULL2|The stock's best weekly performance since October 2011.
NEUT3|How much did Apple add in market cap?
NEUT4|Steve Rousselot breaks down the numbers.
NEUT5|I watched it last week when I watched, you know, I was very.
BEAR6|I was scared.
NEUT7|I came back.
NEUT8|I want to come back early.
BULL9|Well it is great to have you back to be back.
NEUT10|So let's talk about the icons.
NEUT11|Click the icon.
NEUT12|Really big this was we have appointment this week's big number.
BULL13|Big number yes alright every week our money becomes so Apple shares jumped 11% last week.
BULL14|Best weekly gain since October 2011.
BULL15|Apple's market value rose by 43 and a half billion dollars.
NEUT16|So this was the big number that you're talking about that number alone.
NEUT17|Is basically the size of Yahoo and Tesla combined combined combined, and it's also roughly the equivalent of chipmaker Texas Instruments, so so 11 weekly rise for Apple is equivalent to so.
NEUT18|You know, come on, talking your book right?
NEUT19|Carl Icahn bought Apple, shares tweets about it, and affectively, Apple bought Yahoo and Tesla.
NEUT20|You look at their market cap?
NEUT21|Affectively, that's what they do exactly.
NEUT22|So, so the icon may isn't the icon suites that we're talking about.
NEUT23|He had a pair of tweets last week basically saying he's taking a quote large stake in Apple.
BULL24|And he's also urged the company to immediately boost its buyback program that has in place right now.
NEUT25|So couple of whether Apple actually does that or not remains.
NEUT26|We've seen, obviously, but the fact that icon is now getting an Apple and getting an Apple in a big way that journals reported that it's a billion and a half dollar stake that he's taken.
NEUT27|So it's a big chunk of change is any issues.
NEUT28|Guy Guy buys a stock and then talks about it in a very public forum.
BEAR29|Stock goes up just because he talked about it.
NEUT30|Well, I guess people are also looking at Carl Icahn's track record over the past year, which is actually been pretty good if you, especially if you look at tech stocks.
NEUT31|We pointed this out in the story.
NEUT32|He bought Netflix when it was near the bottom, and now the stock has more than tripled on that one.
BULL33|He's doing well in Dell right now.
BULL34|He's doing what, not a text doc, but he's doing well in Herbalife.
BULL35|Also, L&L, he's doing well in Dell, yeah?
NEUT36|And Herbalife also.
BEAR37|I mean he bought that one and that obviously it's been a bitter battle on Wall Street between all these big hedge fund Titans.
NEUT38|But for Carl Icahn he's doing quite well and on betting on Herbalife right now.
NEUT39|So people are thinking alright.
BEAR40|Apples had along, you know 678 month long downdraft here.
BEAR41|Maybe this is a short term bottom and at least in terms of the rise last week it might well do.
NEUT42|Well it had hit.
BEAR43|I mean it had hit a bottom the stock right?
NEUT44|It had so would have been floating around the $400 level for awhile and then it was creeping up to about.
NEUT45|4:50 but now it's above 500 and now 511, right?
NEUT46|Yeah, 511 oh wow.
BULL47|Almost 2% today.
NEUT48|So it was tweeting about it today exactly.
NEUT49|So I mean, who knows?
BEAR50|I mean, Apple still has a lot of headwinds facing the company right now.
BEAR51|A lot of people think that it's lost.
NEUT52|Its cool factor.
NEUT53|What is its next big product going to be?
NEUT54|These are all big concerns facing Apple, but at least in the short term here.
BULL55|Obviously this icon suite is has done a lot for the stock.
NEUT56|So unbelievable.
NEUT57|It's really unbelievable.
NEUT58|All right, Steve Rusila, leave it there.
NEUT59|Thank you.
BULL60|"Thank you."""
