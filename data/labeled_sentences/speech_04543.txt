NEUT0|"""Welcome back to 715 minutes after the session."
NEUT1|Last chance trade time Josh would equal, so I want to give you Netflix and this one is not a swing for the fences trade.
NEUT2|It's a simple risk reward and this may not be your Cup of tea.
NEUT3|This one looked interesting to me.
BULL4|I think there's a potential 8% upside stocks currently $338.00.
NEUT5|That would get you right back to the gap below 321 at the market is telling you you're wrong trades, not going to work.
NEUT6|That's where you'd get out.
NEUT7|Roughly 5% downside, so it's just about 2 to one risk reward.
NEUT8|If you are short term trader, you want to play Netflix for just a volatile stock.
NEUT9|I feel like that's a gamble for that, but why you would trade it like short term don't want to trade non volatile stocks will be here all day.
NEUT10|"Listen not everyone's Cup of tea and I'm not talking about it fundamentally or as an investment, just purely looking at where buyers and sellers are on the chart."""
