NEUT0|"""Short term yields, of course locked down by the Fed steepening at least part due to inflation expectations, stimulus expectations on the longer half, but Evans is talking about the fact that he's unsure yet if it's embedded in terms of those inflation expectations."
NEUT1|Are they embedded?
NEUT2|What's your take, Yogi?
BEAR3|It's really hard to see masses of inflation at the moment, with everything that's going on around the world, you'll see unemployment play out.
BEAR4|That's not good news.
BEAR5|You'll see oil prices higher, which isn't great news.
BEAR6|You're not going to see massive inflation going through through over the longer term, and we're at we're off the view that bond yields are going to stay higher rather than lower for the time being, even though in Europe we've got negative rates.
NEUT7|If you look at it, you got the US 10 year about one spot, 11.
NEUT8|You've got Germany about minus 4.57 in the UK.
NEUT9|N .36 and remember you've also got the rotation trade going on as well out of bonds into equities and commodities on the back of reflation coupled with government issuance longer term as well.
BULL10|"They're all factors to consider here, but it's really hard to see a strong case for inflation longer term at the moment."""
