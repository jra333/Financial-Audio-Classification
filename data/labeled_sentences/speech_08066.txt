BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about Whirlpool so they make appliances mostly like washers and dryers, but other stuff as well, obviously.
NEUT2|Compressed $190.00 which gives them market cap of $11.8 billion.
BULL3|Obviously fairly small company market cap wise, but definitely very well known.
BEAR4|Revenue $19.5 billion, slightly down earnings $1.1 billion, also slightly down.
NEUT5|Current P is 11 with a forward PE of 10.
NEUT6|Nice, very nice.
NEUT7|Didn't hear 2.68% with the payout ratio of 28%.
BULL8|Again, pretty nice.
NEUT9|Total assets $20.4 billion.
NEUT10|Total liabilities $15.6 billion, which gives them total stockholders equity of $3.8 billion.
NEUT11|Not in love with this balance sheet, but it's decent ish.
NEUT12|It's also 30 ish percent of their market cap, so I really do like this balance sheet risk factors.
NEUT13|I don't really think there are any to be honest.
NEUT14|Samsung started selling stuff in the US.
NEUT15|Also other countries, obviously Whirlpool, not really that active all over the world, but very US focused.
NEUT16|So beyond Samsung entering the market which has already happened, I don't think there's really too many risk factors here.
NEUT17|Definitely far fewer risk factors than pretty much any other company have covered so far.
NEUT18|So overall, I would say that for growth investor, obviously this is not the company, it's more of a stable company that is more or less done growing unless they want to get into different markets.
NEUT19|For a value investor, the balance sheet is knee, but the P is very nice.
BEAR20|Earnings growth obviously kind of a problem, but there's also like a global pandemic and everything, so you know I would cut them some slack for that.
BULL21|The dividend is nice.
NEUT22|Bonus on top of that, so I think that's very interesting for value investor to look into and maybe dig a little deeper.
BULL23|For a dividend investor, I think this is a very very good company to look into.
BEAR24|The dividend is really nice, the payout ratio is pretty low.
BULL25|Balance sheet is nice.
BULL26|Obviously there's currently no growth and I would expect growth to be fairly steady, but overall I think that pretty much everything looks really good for dividend investment here.
NEUT27|That's it for me for today.
