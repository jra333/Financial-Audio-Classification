BEAR0|"""A gloomy earnings report from Goldman Sachs Tuesday, the big bank, saying its quarterly earnings dropped 60% and revenue dropped 40% thanks to rocky markets."
BULL1|WSJ's Aaron Lucchetti joins us now to discuss WOW air in a tough quarter for Goldman Bank, saying it took it on the chin and nearly all of its businesses correct, right?
NEUT2|Pretty much across the board.
BEAR3|Revenues down like you said, 40% and that came from trading.
NEUT4|It came from investing in lending which sometimes saves the day in a tough quarter that didn't happen in the first quarter.
BEAR5|A lot of markdowns for their portfolio and that business, so it's pretty much a tough quarter across the board for Lloyd Blankfein's firm absolutely, and looking at the other big banks, Goldman is down almost twice as much.
NEUT6|Let's say is Morgan Stanley.
NEUT7|So what's to account for the big difference?
NEUT8|What did Goldman do so differently?
NEUT9|Well, a few things on that.
BULL10|Their first quarter 2015 was particularly strong, so they had a very high mark to come down off of, and they did.
BEAR11|So that's part of the reason it was such a big decline, but another part of the reason is that the company is very focused on trading in Wall Street businesses.
NEUT12|Morgan Stanley is a giant brokerage firm.
NEUT13|Similar to Meryl Lynch in terms of the size and so that diversifies Morgan, somewhat Goldman is pretty much Wall Street focused, even though it's done a little bit at the margin to get bigger, an investment management, it is still primarily a Wall Street firm, right?
BULL14|And now we know that Goldman beat expectations even though these numbers are so high.
NEUT15|So is the stock trading a little bit higher on this news?
BULL16|Yeah, it's actually up 1% and that's part of the earnings management game, which is not unique to Wall Street firms, but it's definitely a big factor here with the banks this quarter.
BEAR17|All six banks beat the Wall Street consensus estimate from the analysts, which is kind of ironic because it was a terrible quarter from a comparison to the first quarter of 2015.
BEAR18|So the stocks are up today, but they're still off about 1020%, all about managing expectations, I guess.
BULL19|So we know that Goldman has been going through some cost cutting measures to offset some of this.
NEUT20|Do we know where they've been cutting back of those famously big bonuses been squeezed?
NEUT21|Yeah, that's the one big area where Wall Street firms still have that lever to pull its interest rates are staying low, and they have no control over that.
NEUT22|The trading environment is kind of outside of their control, and they can't take as many.
NEUT23|Risks as they used to, so they're not starting trading positions.
NEUT24|They have to be kind of reactive so it's really cost control is the big lever they have in Goldman cut some bonuses.
BEAR25|They also have been relying more on junior staff, so the number of partners is being slowly but surely diminished at Goldman, and that has an impact on the cost line.
NEUT26|Absolutely now, how does this all set up Goldman for the year ahead?
NEUT27|Well, it's a.
NEUT28|It's a big question.
BEAR29|I mean, the first quarter was definitely a bad quarter.
NEUT30|The CFO was on the call this morning, pointing out that it's not time to panic.
NEUT31|It's a cyclical business.
BEAR32|The first quarter of last year was an I told you so moment for Goldman when they could say look we were smart to stick with these Wall Street businesses, but there are lots of quarters that aren't so great and in some past year is actually the first quarter has been particularly weak and then it was a strong second and third quarter.
NEUT33|So it's not time to panic yet.
BULL34|From Goldman standpoint absolutely alright Aaron Lucchetti.
BULL35|Thank you so much for that.
BULL36|"Thank you Tony."""
