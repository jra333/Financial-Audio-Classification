NEUT0|"""If they can get the deal done and video will be able to do the twenty 20s, what Intel was to the 1990s?"
NEUT1|Yes, that is the analogy.
NEUT2|In 1990s Intel was quite sainted.
NEUT3|Can they get it done?
NEUT4|On the one hand, arms not really a competitor when it comes to any trust.
NEUT5|That's normally a pretty good argument.
NEUT6|However, so much of the world runs on arms technology.
NEUT7|They changed.
BEAR8|Their business model would have massive ramifications, and that's bound to make some regulators nervous and videos chips already have near monopoly on cloud based artificial intelligence, but that's just 'cause their sheer brainpower.
NEUT9|Armor, give them even more cloud.
NEUT10|This deal makes him the King of the data center.
NEUT11|Some readers may not like that either, especially overseas, even as it might make the data centers run less hot, quicker and better and that should matter, right?
NEUT12|On top of that, some of arms existing customers but not to be too thrilled.
NEUT13|I mean they got into bed with a company that simply licenses out technology they didn't get in bed, with another chipmaker.
NEUT14|Excuse me and video say said they won't mess with arms business model and I think they can solve this problem by putting that in writing, codifying the open licensing models part of the antitrust approval process.
NEUT15|He speaking man trust.
BEAR16|The argument here is that an NVIDIA arm combo would simply be too powerful, even though they're not direct competitors.
NEUT17|Too much concentration.
BULL18|But when I spoke to Jensen, he sounded confident they will be able to get regulatory approval even in more hostile jurisdictions overseas.
NEUT19|Although it might take some time, I'm betting this thing doesn't close.
NEUT20|It might take 18 months looking cheese.
NEUT21|It could take two years, but it's worth it.
NEUT22|Finally, you gotta worry bout China.
NEUT23|Less time NVIDIA tried to make a big acquisition that was that malloc steal it.
BEAR24|Got held up for over a year because the Chinese authorities wanted to use it as a bargaining chip in the trade war.
NEUT25|Well, that could happen again, but you know what?
NEUT26|There were countless bears who stated that Invidia had no shot at all.
BULL27|Of getting Chinese approval in the middle of a constantly escalating trade war.
BEAR28|They pronounced the Mellanox deal dead.
NEUT29|They turned out to be dead wrong.
NEUT30|Now NVIDIA is a lot more experience navigating China's regulatory apparatus.
BEAR31|Plus, look if Joe Biden wins election November history worse, those worries I think go out the window.
NEUT32|Here's the bottom line.
BULL33|If NVIDIA can close on ARM Holdings, the stock's going to be unstoppable even after its magnificent multi year run.
NEUT34|I think Jensen Wong can eventually make it happen, but what if I'm wrong but the stop was important 86 before the art news and it's only at 494 now.
NEUT35|I like that.
NEUT36|Risk award, even as the stock stood at just $172 one year ago.
