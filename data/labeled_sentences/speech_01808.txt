BULL0|"""Hey guys, how's it going?"
NEUT1|It's Sam.
NEUT2|So as you guys probably know, this company is CRP Entertainment and recently Jeremy has been rising in the stock market, so people have been asking me if I have invested in the company so I have a couple of Korean friends actually did invest in RP and I think their stocks have tripled in the past two years and many economists have attributed it to twice.
NEUT3|Obviously it's also due to the other top stars in the company which include two PM.
NEUT4|Susie got 7 day six etc.
NEUT5|But there's no question that prices also.
NEUT6|A very big factor in that we're basically if you invested into jarppi which has debuted, then you have a lot of.
NEUT7|Profit in your stocks now, so just curious if I invested early because I've been a fan of twice debuted and the answer is no, so I don't have any money in any stocks.
NEUT8|The reason is I simply don't have that much money.
NEUT9|I think when you have thoughts or basically like putting your money away and you're not going to cash out, you know.
NEUT10|So for example, if I put in money in Japanese stocks, yeah I would have tripled by now.
NEUT11|But I'm not going to take it out.
NEUT12|I'm going to keep it in and see if they'll go up higher.
NEUT13|You don't really cash out unless you.
NEUT14|Think that the stock isn't going to get more, and even though I spent a lot of money on twice goods concert at cetera, I simply don't have enough money to invest to actually put away like some money that I won't be able to access.
NEUT15|I don't wanna get too much into like my finances and stuff like that, but I'll just say I honestly don't have the money to invest in stocks are friends who invest in stocks, but I simply can't afford to buy stocks, so unfortunately that's not happening.
NEUT16|Also, I don't even know how I would buy Korean stocks.
NEUT17|Don't look into it too much, but I think it is.
NEUT18|More difficult than buying stocks for an American company.
NEUT19|So for you guys have questions about that.
BULL20|I do not have any stocks into RP, but I do commend fact that they're doing so well.
BULL21|So graduations and I hope Jeff Hughes to grow mass years go on.
BULL22|I'm confident that Jeff doesn't keep growing as a company with more artists coming out soon, and we're twice being at the top right now and still rising higher.
NEUT23|But like I said earlier, just personally, I don't think investing is for me.
NEUT24|I don't have the money to, you know, lock into investments.
NEUT25|Long story short, I don't have any GRP stocks.
NEUT26|Yeah, I'll start new lighting and fire room, so if you guys like this video let me know, but that's about it.
NEUT27|Just answering questions people ask me recently.
NEUT28|And that's about it.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time, bye."""
