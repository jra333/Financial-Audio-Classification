NEUT0|"""The Wall Street Journal report that the FTC is examining whether Facebook bought companies to neutralize possible rivals."
BEAR1|Now, Facebook disclosed in its earnings last week that the FTC has been conducting an antitrust investigation.
NEUT2|The FTC's investigation reportedly is focusing on Facebook's acquisition practices, looking at purchases of Instagram, which was acquired for $1 billion back in 2012.
NEUT3|And WhatsApp, which is bought for $19 billion in 2014.
NEUT4|The question is whether Mark Zuckerberg purchased these companies.
BULL5|To prevent them from challenging Facebook sources, tell me that Facebook is likely to argue that these companies were able to scale as quickly as they did because of Facebook's ownership.
BULL6|We've reached out to both Facebook and the FTC.
NEUT7|They have no comment back over to Julie.
NEUT8|This is completely separate from the from the matter that they settled with the FTC over privacy a couple of weeks ago and takes it off in a completely different direction.
NEUT9|Yes, so we reported a couple months ago that the FTC was in looking into whether they would be investigating Facebook from an antitrust perspective.
NEUT10|Remember the DOJ and the FTC effectively split up the antitrust investigations into tech companies, so the FTC was in charge of the antitrust examination of Facebook.
BEAR11|Then Facebook disclosed last week when they settled that $5 billion fine.
NEUT12|They also disclosed that the FTC was in fact investigating antitrust.
BEAR13|A potential antitrust violations.
NEUT14|At the company, so that's when we learned that there was this antitrust work underway on behalf of the FTC, so this is totally separate from that $5 billion settlement that is about consumer and privacy violations.
NEUT15|"This one is about antitrust, all right."""
