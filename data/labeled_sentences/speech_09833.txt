NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, eats Giacomo speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this quick video on Apple Apple.
BULL2|There is not a lot to say as we can see as being performing very well and even without my any of technical analysis, just using a simple exponential moving average, it is the most trustworthy tool tools in technical analysis we can see that it's been performing very well since since.
NEUT3|April and now it's just moving sideways.
NEUT4|It's just posing ability before going up again, so the idea without again in technical analysis is just to go longer.
NEUT5|Aiming this target price of 140 U.S. dollars with a little bit tomorrow.
NEUT6|Technical analysis with this red line is to measure this.
NEUT7|The trend line.
NEUT8|It is almost parallel to the exponential moving average and the blue line is the major trend is very.
NEUT9|Is is this this trend line is very strong trendline that's been violated once?
BEAR10|I mean, this one was just the market is pushing now, so this is kind of weakness?
NEUT11|Signal, of course, but I think it's more posing before resuming its uptrend.
NEUT12|So the idea is as we are right now we are inside this channel with.
BULL13|With this slope is going again upward, again giving a signal of strength of this market so.
NEUT14|As we are now with Apple is the idea is to invest.
NEUT15|Following the manager then so is to go long and it seems that this is right time to go long.
BULL16|Even because, again, the exponential moving averages been broken up toward.
NEUT17|So the idea is to go along with the first target price of one other 25 years dollar and the second one 135 U.S. dollar.
BEAR18|I think even bigger watch after ways because there is this stochastic that is or in oversold.
NEUT19|So it's in my mean that the stock there is still an opportunity to stock and go down a little bit before going up again.
NEUT20|So for a short time investment.
NEUT21|Perhaps just it's just an old, but for the long term investment is is a long position.
NEUT22|School is a really long position.
NEUT23|I think that in the next weeks so people can start going up again or at least moving inside the channel and so reaching 125 going down again, then up, you know, just just they need to find a little bit of more equilibrium or stability.
NEUT24|Once it.
NEUT25|By then it's been announces new plans, new president biting.
BULL26|That this is good news for all the American markets, and I think that the stock will start going up even be 'cause Apple's car relationship with China.
NEUT27|All the phones are made in China and they will be much of a big massive market in China and with by then.
BULL28|I believe there will be much better relationship with the.
BULL29|Are we to China with Asia so it's all good news for all those IT companies and all the American businesses.
NEUT30|They've got businesses or relationship with in China or in Asia.
NEUT31|So it's all good news.
NEUT32|And I think for those companies and I think yes, that this one for long term investment ideas to go longer, while for a short time just told because he can go a little bit get down there before going up again.
NEUT33|So that's all this is my understanding of this Apple stock always just please guys.
NEUT34|Or ever look to the fundamental news and compare fundamentals with technical analysis always and they should be all of them on the same page.
NEUT35|"Thanks, bye."""
