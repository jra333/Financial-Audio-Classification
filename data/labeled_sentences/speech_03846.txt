BEAR0|"""Both bonds and stocks have been on bull runs of historic duration."
BULL1|Bonds have been rising with occasional interruptions for 40 years.
NEUT2|Stocks for 11.
NEUT3|But what we might call the third major asset class commodities has not been joining the fund, at least not in the last decade.
NEUT4|But that is beginning to change.
BULL5|Since they bottomed early in the pandemic, all kinds of commodities, energy, materials, food have been rising steadily.
BULL6|Here is a chart of copper oil and soybeans, all of which show 60 percentage point increases since their spring lows.
BULL7|There are some good reasons for these price increases.
BEAR8|A decade of low commodity prices means that producers have not invested in capacity crimping supply.
NEUT9|Once the vaccination process is over, commodity stocks that have been allowed to dwindle will have to be rebuilt.
BULL10|Fiscal stimulus if as promised, it is spent on infrastructure, will increase demand for commodities too.
NEUT11|Green infrastructure, for example, requires a lot of copper.
BEAR12|And finally, the US dollar has been weakening.
BEAR13|And as it does, investors expectations of future inflation have gone up.
NEUT14|Investors buy commodities and Commodity Futures as a hedge against future inflation.
NEUT15|So all of this has a certain logic.
NEUT16|But these days we never any asset pops.
NEUT17|You have to ask is this a bubble with rates at historic lows and money sloshing around markets every rally is suspect.
NEUT18|The price of silver, for example.
BULL19|Took an oddly sharp jump this summer and since then has been popular with the very same retail investors who have pushed the shares of GameStop to bizarre highs.
NEUT20|GameStop, though, was easy to see through.
NEUT21|There was never much there but hype and hope.
NEUT22|The price of silver and other commodities are more akin perhaps to US tech stocks.
NEUT23|There is enough of a fundamental story there to justify high prices.
NEUT24|But how high?
NEUT25|"Commodity prices, in other words, look less like a bubble than an excellent set up for one."""
