BULL0|"""And last year you said this would be a good time for health care."
BULL1|Ma looks like you were right.
NEUT2|Well, I don't want to say I'm a mind reader or prescient, but no, it's been.
NEUT3|You know, we talked about the the cocktail that in terms of low interest rates and at the time I was early December, the corporate tax plan, lower corporate tax rates was was was a planet.
NEUT4|Wasn't law yet.
NEUT5|So what we've seen now is enacting a tax plan which is lower corporate tax rates.
NEUT6|Significantly, we still have relatively low interest rates either, even with the 10 year Treasury 285, we still have, you know, by historical standards.
BULL7|1020 years, very low interest rates and we have CEO confidence.
NEUT8|So those three.
NEUT9|Things together, you know, sort of.
NEUT10|Create that cocktail.
NEUT11|That sort of sets the stage for M&A activity.
NEUT12|So how much of it was the tax cuts?
NEUT13|I mean, as you saw it become certain and then actually enacted your phone just ring off the hook immediately and you get a lot of CEOs calling up.
NEUT14|Yeah, it wasn't necessarily that.
NEUT15|I think it's a combination of that.
NEUT16|I think.
BEAR17|The other thing you have to think about is we've had two attempts by the Trump administration to lower.
NEUT18|I mean to adjust around the edges.
BEAR19|The Affordable Care Act both have failed.
NEUT20|There's been some some fine tuning around the edges, but no significant repeal and replace, which was the goal of the Trump administration from day one.
NEUT21|So you now have a framework where you know what the regulatory framework looks like over the next two years, and we're facing midterm elections, so nothing significant is likely going to happen over the next 6 to 8 months and just to sort of picture what we're looking at here in terms of M&A, if you come inside the Bloomberg and look at me go, this is the deal count for Pharmaceuticals, healthcare services and health care products products or the Yellow line services are the white line, and Pharmaceuticals are the orange line.
NEUT22|Walk me through drew, what we're going to see like?
NEUT23|Where do you see what?
NEUT24|Where do you hear from your sources where we see the most activity?
NEUT25|I think they were most interested in most curious about certainly is looking at these kind of interesting deals in the healthcare delivery chain where we have you guys flashed up the CVS Aetna deal?
NEUT26|That's a really interesting combination to me.
NEUT27|I mean two players that traditionally been on the opposite side of the negotiating table, competing in different parts of the supply chain.
NEUT28|All of a sudden, you know, working together in this really, really ambitious way to try and change the healthcare system?
NEUT29|I mean, we're expecting that there could be more of these.
NEUT30|I know there was talk of a Walgreens.
NEUT31|AmerisourceBergen which in some ways.
NEUT32|Is more like a supply chain consolidation, but I have a feeling that they are, you know and from what we know about past deals that were out there, pieces of the health care system that could be combined with some interesting players here.
NEUT33|That's the stuff that we've been most fascinated about and also looking at the entry of, you know, potentially big disruptive players like Amazon or something.
NEUT34|Amazon like that May end up coming in their gym.
NEUT35|You agree, no.
NEUT36|Absolutely, I think look the Amazon effect.
NEUT37|We've seen it across DIFF Industries.
NEUT38|Whether it's publishing, you know, the book business now with the Whole Foods acquisition was going to the grocery business.
NEUT39|As we talked about last time health care is this, you know, it's almost 20% of GDP.
NEUT40|It's too big to ignore.
BULL41|I think that Amazon looks at the distribution and the food chain of distribution is Drew discussed and the margins are particularly attractive.
NEUT42|And if they can intervene and get in the middle of that, it's just, you know.
BULL43|"Once again another industry that they could get significant market share relatively quickly."""
