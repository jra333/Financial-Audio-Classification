NEUT0|"""What's up everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel today.
BULL2|I want to talk about Tesla in my stock price prediction, so in premarket this morning we reached 700 finally and it is a landmark.
NEUT3|I think it's something that a lot of people didn't think was coming at the beginning of this year.
BEAR4|There were a lot of people who were doubting Tesla when we were right here.
NEUT5|When I started to buy and now you know, you see if you were to have held the stock.
NEUT6|For a long period of time you were to see the reward.
NEUT7|Tesla still has a lot of growth, but this is look at this price.
NEUT8|Guys like 700 for a stock man.
NEUT9|If you have that money to ditch out.
NEUT10|You know every week hats off to you, but it is over.
BULL11|It is up there in price.
NEUT12|So what I think is going to happen with Tesla is you're going to start to see some consolidation and all that means is the price is going to act just like if I were to have fast Internet.
NEUT13|So like I was explaining before with Microsoft, you see how it was flat for almost six months.
BULL14|This is healthy.
NEUT15|Most people don't know this.
NEUT16|Stocks should not go up forever like Tesla did.
NEUT17|The fact that Microsoft here has bottoms right?
NEUT18|So it hits bottoms multiple times.
NEUT19|I think it was.
NEUT20|I think 202 was the bottom for a very long time and now we're starting to see a new bottom.
BEAR21|You see recently the bottom was 210.
BULL22|It keeps hitting 210 and it's going up so I think that that's going to happen with Tesla.
NEUT23|I would love to see that happen with Tesla.
BULL24|That will give me an indication to start buying Tesla again.
NEUT25|When it starts to consolidate because when it drives up so fast like it did right here, it comes down even faster like that.
NEUT26|That's not what you want to see.
NEUT27|You wanted to see it going up and consolidating like it did right here, right before the next drum up, right?
NEUT28|So I think the earnings Tesla's next earnings is going to be a key indicator of whether the stock is going to go up, down or consolidate.
NEUT29|So right now I'm just keeping my eye open.
NEUT30|I don't have any plans to buy Tessa.
BULL31|I think 700 it's up there in price.
NEUT32|If it does come down to a more reasonable price to buy it, I would definitely you know, Chuck some money at it, but as of right now I just want to play it a little safe, specially because earnings for next month is coming up for all the tech sectors.
BULL33|So I think that that is the best thing that we can do at this time period.
NEUT34|But yeah, this year has been crazy guys.
NEUT35|And it seems like 10 years ago then I started invest when it was just 910 months ago when I seriously started to mess in Tesla and Tesla has a bright future.
BULL36|I think that if people hop on board now being cautious, they will see decent returns in the future.
NEUT37|"So I hope you guys like and subscribe on the video and I'll see you in the next one."""
