NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Friday, November the 17th, 2017."
NEUT1|I'm referred by John Currency analyst at xm.com and today we're going to be looking at the US dollar versus the yen on the four hour chart.
BEAR2|Dollar Yen at the moment is in a bearish bias in the short term.
BEAR3|We can see the RSI is flat, so at the moment demand momentum is rather neutral.
BULL4|We can see prices have found support from.
BEAR5|That one month low a couple of days ago of 112.47 they did touch a fresh one month lower 112.39 earlier two day if we do see further downside prices could target the 112 handle as just below that level.
NEUT6|112.95 It is the 165.8% people need replacement of the public from 112 point, 47213 point.
NEUT7|32 below that we have a previous key support area.
BEAR8|111.60 If prices managed to break below that level, that could signal a shift to a more bearish outlook in the medium term.
NEUT9|And below that we have that 161.8% baci at just above the 111 handle.
NEUT10|At the moment though the medium term bullish outlook is just about holding though it has become much more neutral.
BULL11|Given the recent declines.
BULL12|But if we do see a reversal of the count downside momentum, we could see resistance coming from the 50% Fibonacci at 112 point.
NEUT13|90 and just above that 113 we have the 20.
NEUT14|Moving average, and that's also the 38.2% Fibonacci.
NEUT15|We can see the 20.
NEUT16|Moving average has been acting as resistance in the past.
NEUT17|Couple of days and further up we do have the.
BEAR18|That top of 113.32 just below the 50.
BULL19|Moving average a break above that level would help shift device the near term bias to A to a bullish one and potentially we could see that would help strengthen the upside momentum to target the previous top.
BULL20|So apparent 13.90 and 114.73, which was an 8 month high back in early November.
NEUT21|Just it for me.
BULL22|Thank you very much for watching.
NEUT23|"And have a great day."""
