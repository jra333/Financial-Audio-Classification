NEUT0|"""What does good RX offer that Amazon doesn't?"
NEUT1|I mean, how is good RX going to compete with Amazon?
NEUT2|Sure, I. I think the conversations being set up as if we're competitors, and I'm not actually sure that's the right comparison.
NEUT3|What Amazon did yesterday was they launched an updated version of Pill Pack which is there online pharmacy they've owned since 2018, which is great.
BULL4|They're trying to get more Americans to buy prescriptions online.
NEUT5|Unfortunately only about 5% of prescriptions actually Mail order, and it's not even accelerating much in covid.
NEUT6|Meanwhile, we have a program called Good RX Gold, which actually has lower prices.
NEUT7|About 90% of the time.
NEUT8|They also added a discount card which hundreds of other companies have been doing for years.
NEUT9|I mean, honestly, for decades before we even came along.
NEUT10|But it's not even a priority for them.
NEUT11|It's very hard to find, and you can always imagine how weird it would be if I showed it Amazon discount card at a Walmart pharmacy.
NEUT12|I suspect that probably won't actually be something that last for very long.
NEUT13|In short, we actually don't think it'll impact as much, but I think investors or web or seeing you are seeing news about Amazon Pharmacy and somehow assuming it will impact us.
BULL14|I'm really excited about the stuff we're working on, and some of our new initiatives that are growing super fast.
NEUT15|But I guess the news is all about something else right now.
NEUT16|Doug, are you saying that you don't consider Amazon Pharmacy a competitor?
BULL17|I think that Amazon certainly has a product switch.
NEUT18|Maybe somewhere down the road we might have conflicting agendas, but actually right now good RX actually partners with Amazon and oftentimes correct discounts can be used at Amazon Pharmacy correctly.
NEUT19|Partners of people throughout the healthcare ecosystem.
NEUT20|You know, everyone, pharmacies, manufacturers, physicians were actually sort of Switzerland.
NEUT21|If you can think of it that way and we just work with whoever will help us get Americans, the health care they needed a price they can afford.
NEUT22|So you know this.
NEUT23|This kind of US versus Amazon fight is I don't think actually the right way to go.
NEUT24|Trade us we we work closely together and we don't think it will have a material impact on our business in the in the short term.
BEAR25|OK, so you don't seem to be concerned about Amazon, but investors are concerned JPMorgan slapped a sell rating on Good RX This morning.
NEUT26|Following this news.
NEUT27|This is of course after your huge September IPO and analysts were already at that time kind of split on this off.
NEUT28|What do you say to the skeptics?
NEUT29|You know, I think pharmacy is really confusing and throughout our history.
NEUT30|Remember it's been almost a decade that good RX has been in existence.
NEUT31|People have told us that, you know, we know we don't understand, or this is how the industry works.
NEUT32|The reality is it's quite confusing.
BEAR33|It's really hard.
NEUT34|There's very few people who get you know, knee deep in the in the complex economics of pharmacy.
BULL35|I've just I'm very confident of our position.
NEUT36|We've been doing this for a long time.
BULL37|We have incredibly smart people that work here were very close with people in the industry, and I think we have a superior product.
BULL38|We've saved Americans $25 billion.
NEUT39|We have almost 5,000,000 people a month.
NEUT40|He's going to save.
NEUT41|We know so much about this.
BULL42|"This very obscure, you know complicated industry and I'm very proud of the products that we offer that I think frankly are are far better than any out there."""
