NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol Avgi are we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Quite eventful day today on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level musically would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT7|Could say up here above $1.82 and I don't get me wrong.
BEAR8|The price falls below Dollar 82.
NEUT9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL10|But yeah, if the price could manage to actually stay above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT15|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT16|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT17|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|His visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being presented against him over Dollar 82 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line.
NEUT20|Walls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|First, he loved to be right there at $1.97.
NEUT22|That's just simply where the party stopped.
NEUT23|Today several times and then after $1.97.
NEUT24|Next key level as I squeeze on the chart here, always a good problem to have.
NEUT25|But after $1.97 next key level up there at $2.10.
NEUT26|So keep around those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT27|But on all any angle you look at it, great volume today.
NEUT28|Great price movement and not just a question of Canada price build upon this momentum.
NEUT29|Moving forward, let's see what happens.

BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR38|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
