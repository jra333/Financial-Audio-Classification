BULL0|"""Last night, the President elect announced a gigantic $1.9 trillion stimulus."
NEUT1|All sorts of goodies.
NEUT2|Exactly what Wall Street wanted and what happened.
NEUT3|Well, the average is rolled over Galluzzi 107 seven points SMB backsliding .72% in the NASDAQ, falling .87% a lot of favors way down now if you scratch your head about this, the explanation is surprisingly simple.
NEUT4|People one event occurs and the market gets exactly what it wants, but nothing more.
NEUT5|It's treated as a reason to sell.
NEUT6|Not to buy.
BEAR7|Biden stimulus bill nearly Max Xpectations.
NEUT8|It didn't beat the stimulus, whisper, so to speak.
BEAR9|Plus it sure didn't help that.
BEAR10|Wells Fargo, JP Morgan and Citigroup or reported today and their numbers were promptly pan good and bad at the big banks are in trouble.
BEAR11|Well, that's a real problem, but I think the market completely misjudged these results.
NEUT12|JP Morgan Citigroup both made a ton of money.
BULL13|Wells Fargo is doing better than we could have imagined a couple of years ago.
NEUT14|Even as CEO Charlie Scharf.
BEAR15|Sound of disappointment, I think he's lowballing.
NEUT16|Frankly, let me put it this way.
BULL17|If the bank stocks hadn't run up going into earnings, I bet JPMorgan would have rallied a couple of bucks today.
BEAR18|City might have gained a point, and Wells Fargo might have dropped less than a point.
BEAR19|Instead, all three got slaughtered.
NEUT20|And the repealing earlier games.
NEUT21|My advice?
NEUT22|Why don't you wait three days counting today, then buy the stock at JPMorgan the best of breed or Wells Fargo?
BULL23|The worst debris that's going to be better.
NEUT24|I remember I love those.
NEUT25|See stories to get to be.
BULL26|Plus they'll be able to buy back a boatload of stock this year and raise their dividend substantially, which is exactly what the shareholder base really wants.
NEUT27|You just need to be patient.
NEUT28|Now.
NEUT29|I know patience is in short supply everywhere, but that's what you must be if you're a bank investor.
NEUT30|Now with that cheery thought mine, let's dive right into the game plan today.
NEUT31|We heard from the traditional deposit banks on Tuesday we're going to hear from an investment bank, Goldman Sachs, which specializes in all sorts of transactions as well as wealth management betting.
NEUT32|The quarter will be a barn burner.
NEUT33|I think they had a great trading month in December, but the numbers might not matter judging by today's reception for the Big money center banks.
BULL34|Plus, Goldman stock has been a juggernaut up from 190 in November to 301 now.
NEUT35|In other words, it's coming in high.
NEUT36|And I don't like hot when it comes to earning season.
BULL37|Only a massive earnings beat based on both revenue growth and lower expenses can propel this stock to higher levels and normal beat is not enough.
BULL38|Plus we need a super duper raised forecast in order for this Doctor Rally.
NEUT39|Next up is Bank of America which is much more prospect like free Bird from this point.
BULL40|While the stock pullback nearly 3% today, I think will be hard pressed really much after the quarter even as we interviewed CEO Brian went in not long ago and he said business has been terrific.
BEAR41|The stocks been straight up ever since then.
NEUT42|Like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America is coming and smoking in the last couple of months.
NEUT43|What search for 24 to 33 once again when the expectations are this high, it's not enough to be good.
NEUT44|You gotta be creative.
