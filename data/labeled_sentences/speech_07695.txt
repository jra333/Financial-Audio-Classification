NEUT0|"""And the big story of the week, kinda sorta."
NEUT1|I don't know, Warren Buffett steps up and buys Kinder Morgan.
NEUT2|He bought what 26 and a half million shares or something?
NEUT3|Yeah somewhere just just shy of 400 millions 100,000,000.
NEUT4|So not big for him.
NEUT5|But now it's nice to see.
NEUT6|Yeah, I mean anytime that a company gets the stamp of approval from Warren Buffett, it's normally a pretty good sign when you're looking at a three $400 million acquisition, it probably means that it might not have been Buffett himself.
NEUT7|It may have been one of his.
NEUT8|This has a Todd Combs field hooks.
NEUT9|It's only $400 million, so it may not actually be Buffett himself, but certainly within the same another Lieutenant.
NEUT10|He has time zones an anyway, not ringing a Bell right now, but I mean if you look at Kinder Morgan.
NEUT11|You know you go from a company that.
NEUT12|Few months ago it's it was kind of everybody was questioning.
BULL13|Oh, is this dividend sustainable?
BEAR14|Running into some credit, you're going to run into some credit ratings, and then they immediately cut.
NEUT15|And now I've got to assume that it wasn't just like back in December when this happened.
NEUT16|Berkshire Hathaway and the people there said, oh really, time to start looking at these guys and then they pull a trigger on it within months.
NEUT17|Actually, if you think about it, the purchase that they made on the 13 F would have come.
NEUT18|In the fourth quarter, right?
NEUT19|So this.
NEUT20|This was actually probably happening then, but I've got to imagine that the months and quarters and maybe even a year or so before that, this was something that was on the radar.
NEUT21|I can't imagine that they made such a quick decision on that without really looking at the business long term.
NEUT22|Got it and actually had Wessler.
NEUT23|Yeah, Todd Combs and Ted West.
NEUT24|There we go, and actually, I think Ted.
NEUT25|He lives here in Virginia and Charlottesville.
BULL26|Yeah, thank you.
NEUT27|"Alright so anyway."""
