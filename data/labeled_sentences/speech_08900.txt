BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about AMC stock.
NEUT2|My predictions for Monday as well as the rest of the week.
NEUT3|So stick around.
NEUT4|But before I get into the video, make sure hit the subscribe button to keep up with our daily videos and also check out the links in the description to join the Discord in the page around.
NEUT5|So in this video I want to talk about AMC stock and also this week ahead in general.
NEUT6|So right now AMC stock closed the week at 1345 after we reach $20 earlier in the week.
NEUT7|I think this week is going to be another interesting week.
BULL8|I also think there's a good chance that AMC is going to get some momentum back and make another run.
NEUT9|So outside of this stock in a good chance to run up, I just want to say I've been buying the stock bit by bit over the last few months simply because I love going to the theater and I really don't want to see this company go out of business simply for this talja regions.
NEUT10|And also I don't think we're going to worry about that anymore.
NEUT11|This is another one of these so-called meme stocks, and this stock has been shorted quite a bit over the last few months, so one big thing I think is going to kind of determine how this week plays out is all these restrictions on Robin Hood currently.
NEUT12|They have a bunch of restrictions on a bunch of different stocks, including AMC.
NEUT13|So as of the last time I looked at these Robinhood restrictions there, limiting AMC buys to one share, which in my opinion is completely ridiculous.
NEUT14|But that's a whole other topic.
NEUT15|I'm not going to get into in this video.
NEUT16|So obviously a lot can still change by the time we get to market open Monday, but I don't know about you guys.
NEUT17|I'm super excited to see how this week plays out, especially for stocks like GameStop, Nokia and then obviously AMC.
NEUT18|And then this might be wishful thinking, but I'm really hoping to see some of these restrictions on Robin Hood get lifted this week.
BULL19|So personally, I'm going to look to pick up some more shares on each dip because I think we're going to get some of that momentum back.
NEUT20|I think we'll see another push to above $20.00, but what do you guys think about AMC?
NEUT21|Let me know your predictions down below and then.
NEUT22|"Also remember this isn't financial advice, so it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
