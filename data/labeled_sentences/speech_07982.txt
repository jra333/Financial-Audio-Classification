NEUT0|"""Hi guys, in this video we will talk about stock market and stock prices, why they go up?"
NEUT1|And down.
NEUT2|So what is stock market stock market is the place where you can buy the company's stock.
NEUT3|For example, if you wanna buy Apple Company stock, you can buy it from NASDAQ.
NEUT4|That is a Stock Exchange.
NEUT5|There are two main stock exchanges, NASDAQ and NYC Stock Exchange.
NEUT6|So why stocks go up and down?
NEUT7|There are five main reasons.
NEUT8|First, supply and demand stacks high or low price depends on buyers and sellers.
BEAR9|The stock will go high if too many people are interested in it.
BEAR10|But on the other side, is stock will go down if nobody wanna buy it.
NEUT11|Second reason profit and loss.
NEUT12|The other things that fluctuate companies start is how much profit companies making.
BULL13|For example, if it companies making profit for a long term, it's stock will rise.
BEAR14|But if a company going into loss its stock price will start falling.
NEUT15|Third reason.
NEUT16|News.
BEAR17|Top Stock price of stock sometime affected by the news.
NEUT18|When investors hear good news about the company, where they have invested their money, they will pay more price for the star can it will go up what?
BEAR19|On the flip side when they heard news about scandals and fraud deals in the company, the stock price will fell down, obviously.
BULL20|Fourth reason bright future when investors think this company will grow more in the future.
NEUT21|They keep the stock for long term and the company also paying dividends to its investors.
NEUT22|Time to time that make it trust between company and investors.
BULL23|For this reason the stock will go high.
NEUT24|5th trading many people buy and staff sell stock every day.
BEAR25|That also fluctuates stock price temporarily.
NEUT26|So that was my reasons why stocks go up or down.
