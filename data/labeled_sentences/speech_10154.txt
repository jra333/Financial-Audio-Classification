NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
BULL1|Welcome back.
NEUT2|The stock trans channel.
NEUT3|So in this video we're going over ticker symbol IPO, C Social capital, the merger with Clover, Healthier looking at potential price targets, areas of support and resistance.
NEUT4|Based on the chart and some timing and some news we're expecting here in the near term.
NEUT5|So with that being said, if you are new here, consider subscribing to the channel in the thumbs up button and we're using we bowls desktop platform.

NEUT9|So with that said, big day here on Friday actually IPO.
BULL10|See many pretty big push up now 10% or so 9% during the day in 2% after hours.
BULL11|So nice big push, big volume, little push here with IPO.
BULL12|See very solid look that we see.
NEUT13|Now we want to do is look to actually what's going on here.
NEUT14|Some time frames to be watching out for and what we're expecting in the near term.
NEUT15|So just based off the chart.
BULL16|Technically speaking we have some areas of resistance up around $13.00, so we have about $0.50 or so until we start getting up towards that resistance line.
NEUT17|So we're going to see how this actually transitions into next week because.
BEAR18|We do have a short holiday week, potentially less traders, but also at the same time.
BEAR19|If people have off from work, potentially more traders looking to kind of take action here on the early parts of the week going up into the holiday period.
NEUT20|So with that said, we have to watch this volume Candle watch these volume bars with the volume bar on Monday is larger and green right?
BULL21|We have a Green Day.
BULL22|It's larger than the prior day here on Friday that could certainly be a big sign for a potential move into breakout over this 13 to 1335 level that we've been seeing as a resistance point in the past.
NEUT23|So with that said, we're expecting right now is.
NEUT24|With Clover Health were expecting a ticker change to CLOV, and that's expected on January 8.
NEUT25|The latest news we have here on January 8th, and that's of course going to happen.
NEUT26|Depending on this shareholder meeting here on the 6th of January.
NEUT27|And if that does happen, if we have the merger, everything goes according to plan.
NEUT28|Then yes, by the 8th or expecting the ticker change to CLOV.
NEUT29|So that's where we watching.
NEUT30|Of course, that's their biggest catalyst, so we'd be looking at a run up into that catalyst.
NEUT31|And of course, once we have the official change, there's going to be some volatility into that.
NEUT32|So definitely watching it.
BEAR33|Early January, there are certainly going to be volatility here with IPO.
NEUT34|See before that potential ticker change to CLOV.
NEUT35|If you are someone who is a shareholder, make sure to vote.
NEUT36|You must do so, because if you don't vote, we saw that happen.
NEUT37|Actually, this past week with Elsie, a merger with Golden Nugget, Online Gaming and they didn't get enough shareholders actually vote, and so you need to have enough shareholders vote for this to actually happen so this merger can happen.
NEUT38|If no one votes.
NEUT39|So make sure if you're a shareholder.
NEUT40|Please make sure you vote so that set this stock looks like that 13 areas will be able to this point.
NEUT41|So up in here is going to be business now.
NEUT42|In terms of support, now we have some of these highs right up around here on this 1175.
BULL43|Now that we're above that level, I would expect you know this 1175 towards 11:50 to be nice area of support right now.
NEUT44|Based on the chart.
NEUT45|If that doesn't all happen, everything cracks down and we had to see a worst case scenario.
BEAR46|This stock could come down down towards 10:50 or so and that's another area of strong support that we've been seeing lately, so hopefully that is helpful.
