BULL0|"""Hello everyone, analytics edge."
NEUT1|So regarding the Amazon chart I published a video.
NEUT2|On 14th of Feb I suggested that raid setup and I mentioned when 3434 gets broken.
NEUT3|You can be the buyer so the level never got broken.
NEUT4|I might trade.
NEUT5|I closed the order I had.
BEAR6|We are still in the uptrend in my opinion.
NEUT7|We have not had then validation.
NEUT8|I have in mind so this is the invalidation for that analysis.
NEUT9|This is still valid.
NEUT10|It doesn't mean you have to buy, but this is still valid.
NEUT11|So if I see some sort of reversal and market breaks thirty 33337.
BULL12|Then probably we will still have a space to go up.
NEUT13|The triangle idea is not invalidated yet yet, but if we break this level.
NEUT14|Then I need to re count and see what is happening.
NEUT15|3085 is my limit because we need one more wave to complete this pattern.
NEUT16|But I can even count this as this is a very rare situation, but that can happen.
NEUT17|So this one I can't it as an impulsive wave anaza Wave 5 and then we can say we have a short wave five.
BEAR18|If that happens we have to see a very massive reversal.
NEUT19|I'm keeping my eye on Amazon to see how it performs here and then if we break this level, I would go back and revise my wave count.
BULL20|"Thanks for watching."""
