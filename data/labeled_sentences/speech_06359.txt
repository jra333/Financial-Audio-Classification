BULL0|"""The January 25 record closes still shy of an intraday high, let's get to botosani pay Bob."
BEAR1|Hello Carl, three to two advancing declining stocks and we're near a new high on the S&P 500.
NEUT2|I know you can find that hard to believe, but just take a look with 3855.
NEUT3|That was the old closing high that was January 25th.
BEAR4|We're only 20 points away from another historic high in the SP.
NEUT5|After that big dip around GameStop around Robin Hood and all of those issues sectors wise.
NEUT6|It's kind of about an even balance here.
BULL7|China continues to be the outstanding performer on the year that MCH eyes up about 1314% energies.
BULL8|OK, banks are doing OK. Tech is on the flattish side, you know Alphabet's got a new high, but the Mega Caps are mostly down today.
BEAR9|Consumer staples has been lagging the entire year.
NEUT10|Not a single update.
BEAR11|I don't think the shorts a surprisingly modest trading range today.
BULL12|I think we're 15% up on a GameStop today, but those are not big moves compared to what we've been seeing recently.
NEUT13|I'll tell you what is a big move secretary Yellen's calling a meeting of the regulators?
NEUT14|I pay very close attention to this.
NEUT15|If I was Robin Hood and everybody else, the thing to lookout for is FINRA.
NEUT16|That's the financial industry regulatory.
NEUT17|Authority there are people who regulate the broker dealers.
NEUT18|They put out a statement the other day, specifically, say 2021.
NEUT19|We're going to look at the gamification of trading and here's how they set it here.
NEUT20|This focus includes risks associated with that based platforms with interactive or game like features that are intended to influence customers, their related forms of marketing, and the appropriateness of the activity that they are proving clients to undertake.
NEUT21|Through these platforms, the word here is appropriateness.
NEUT22|This is where they get you.
BEAR23|'cause they're going to probably push some arguments that some of the things that are going on are not appropriate for the customers that are using it.
NEUT24|Very, very difficult situation for Robin Hood, but even other broker dealers in general in terms of what's moving the markets.
NEUT25|The GameStop thing is less of a concern for the markets overall here.
NEUT26|So a little bit less systemic risk concerns about that.
NEUT27|Back to the stimulus.
NEUT28|Go big on reconciliation is a big reason the markets been moving in the last couple of days.
BULL29|And of course the vaccine rollout, continuing an earnings positive surprises here folks.
NEUT30|We're almost halfway through earnings season.
BEAR31|And if you look at the numbers, it looks like the third quarter their analysts were too conservative.
BULL32|Again, almost 20% beats that we're seeing beats 20% above what the estimates are.
NEUT33|Way too conservative guys, and that's the best thing that's happened in the markets right now.
NEUT34|And finally, I know that Jim mentioned Miracle-gro.
NEUT35|But the company's comment is just precious here.
BULL36|We are working closely with our retail partners as they prepare for the upcoming growing season stocks up 100% in the last year.
NEUT37|Whatever growing season you're preparing for.
NEUT38|Scott's got a part of it.
NEUT39|Apparently Carl back to you.
BULL40|All right, Bob, thanks.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
