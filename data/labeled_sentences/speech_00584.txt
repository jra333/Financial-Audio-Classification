NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and in this video we're going to take a look at a long trade set up in eBay."
NEUT1|Now I know if you guys have been following eBay for any length of time, probably a little surprise, but we are going to talk about eBay and that is actually in a breakout pattern.
NEUT2|So you can see here in eBay, just continually consolidating on the weekly chart.
NEUT3|But the last few months.
BEAR4|Or so we've started to actually see a bit of an uptrend develop on the weekly chart.
NEUT5|You can see here that we've had this progression of.
NEUT6|Consolidations to the upside right.
NEUT7|You guys know that's what we like to see on any type of weekly chart you have one right in there and now another one here and now.
BULL8|We're breaking out alright, so on the weekly chart we can consider that to be in breakout territory.
NEUT9|Now let's take a little bit of a closer look at the daily chart and daily chart.
BULL10|Similar setup developing OK you have this longer term trendline intact and you can also see that we have this.
NEUT11|Consolidation pattern right.
NEUT12|So depending on how you want to draw this, you can draw this is 1 big consolidation pattern like this or you can look at it as a bit of a tighter consolidation.
NEUT13|That's actually how I'm playing this in my personal account.
NEUT14|So what I'm doing is I'm getting long eBay tomorrow at the open.
BULL15|Alright, it finally got through.
NEUT16|That 6079 area alright really should have triggered on on Friday.
NEUT17|Alright for today.
BULL18|But still has what I believe to be a good risk reward setup.
NEUT19|So here's the setup in eBay.
NEUT20|Again, you can look here at your stop down here around 57 or if you want to be a little bit more aggressive with it, you could look at 5861.
BULL21|What I'm doing is I'm entering with a stop around 57 and then looking to potentially add to the position as it continues to outperform.
NEUT22|So that's it for this trade.
NEUT23|Again, we are looking at a long trade in eBay, which is unusual considering how long its consolidated.
NEUT24|So that's it for tonight.
BULL25|Again, thanks for coming and will see you next one.
NEUT26|"Take care."""
