BULL0|"""It's at where we're launching the treatment issue with Dream Drive, Lucid Dream drive, and we've got we've taken the approach that we need to be world class in terms of the hardware suite for it."
NEUT1|I'll go into the software and in a moment so we've got the dream drive.
NEUT2|We've got integrated $0.32 a Suite 14 cameras including driver monitor.
NEUT3|We've got surround new arranged rate radar.
NEUT4|We got a long range radar in the nose and we've also got 120 degree solid state LIDAR in the in the nose, and that's good for about 140 meters.
NEUT5|So we've got a super comprehensive sensing suite.
NEUT6|We've got 2 terabytes of onboard storage and massive computer computing power and we link a lot of this with our Ethernet ring are GBK highway in the car and nodal ring, which is revolutionary and and the car super connected as well.
NEUT7|So we've got the ability to get big data to and from the car.
NEUT8|And really, that the ultimate incensing.
NEUT9|But let me tell you the enormity of the challenge to solve.
NEUT10|Say a level 4 autonomous software.
BEAR11|I'm totally the general consensus in Silicon Valley where I am here today is that that is a $10 billion in 10 year problem and I was talking to a renowned executive just the other weekend and he said, no pity you've got it wrong.
NEUT12|It's a lot more than $10 billion.
NEUT13|Nobody really knows now, this was really hott.
NEUT14|Hot stuff a few years ago everybody was predicting fleets of Robo taxis.
BEAR15|By 2018-2019 latest and you know I was quite bearish about it.
BULL16|And I I was, but I am bullish about really taking electric cars to another level.
NEUT17|I don't think they've been optimized at all.
NEUT18|Yeah, I think there's a lot more mileage in electric car technology, button or quite quite.
NEUT19|Reserved about my view about when we get to level 4 autonomous.
NEUT20|I think it's a considerable intellectual problem and if it if it's if it don't get me wrong, I think it's a matter of when it happens, not if.
NEUT21|So you know we didn't have access.
NEUT22|We don't have access at Lucid to spend $10 billion on on software.
BULL23|So while taking the approach pragmatically of being competitive will go to market with a Level 2, maybe a level 2 plus level of autonomous driving and we can over the air upgrade that car with a sensor suite is good for Level 3.
NEUT24|We know that.
NEUT25|But pragmatically, do I then spend billions on developing in-house 80 software?
NEUT26|When you know that we need every penny to get, you know are a range of products out.
NEUT27|Now I know.
NEUT28|I think the pragmatic route should be would potentially be to partner with someone else in Silicon Valley, on the software.
NEUT29|"And that's the pragmatist in them."""
