BULL0|"""It's not a shocker on any obscure and the EW's business to one of the biggest software businesses on the planet."
NEUT1|Every startup we talked to in mature company is using the WS to underpin their back end.
NEUT2|This is the bulk of the profitability for Amazon.
NEUT3|It lets them experiment in the other segments of the business that are less profitable like retail and so we think.
BULL4|Ultimately this is a great move.
NEUT5|I don't think that really much is going to change.
NEUT6|Obviously.
NEUT7|If you're a software individual, which I am for 20 plus years.
BULL8|We're all excited because this is the recurring visibility in the bulk of the profitability of the company, and we think that this will only firmly established that they're going to continue to spend aggressively against Microsoft and Google, so we like this move.
NEUT9|Obviously didn't expect the move, but thinking any obviously is an incredible leader, and in what they built in a WS is is really hard to comprehend given what they did in the face of all these other tech Giants that were chasing them that were really, you know, software DNA.
NEUT10|Amazon was not a software company to begin with, to the point of those other tech Giants.
NEUT11|What you make of alphabet numbers.
BULL12|Phenomenal best top line in 2 1/2 years.
NEUT13|Best bottom line.
BEAR14|In three years the cloud number was a little inline.
BULL15|Microsoft Azure actually outgrew the Google Cloud, so Microsoft is taking share and the Microsoft Azure numbers bigger than Google, so you know good numbers.
NEUT16|Overall this is a cheap stock.
BULL17|Again we see the stock going higher on a 15 times EBIT down multiple.
BEAR18|Again the stocks trading below its EBIT our growth.
BULL19|We continue to view off about as a top large cap bat for us alongside Amazon and Microsoft.
NEUT20|Back to the big news Brent on Amazon.
NEUT21|You mentioned you're excited as someone who covers software and someone who knows Andy Jassy and has seen the Juggernaut that he's built inside of Amazon.
NEUT22|But, but ultimately, Amazon is an online retailer.
NEUT23|That's the bulk of where the company, right Anet, owns Whole Foods.
NEUT24|And there's so many other aspects.
NEUT25|So what is it?
NEUT26|What is the appointment an the future look like for that which has been in such a big growth period because of the pandemic and does face some tough comps?
NEUT27|As we come out of Covid.
BULL28|Yeah, look, the retail business is phenomenal.
NEUT29|I'm not trying to downplay that.
NEUT30|It's incredible.
BULL31|We think it's long lasting e-commerce tailwinds or permanent and we do believe there in great shape.
BEAR32|But your point Sarah there is going to be a deceleration in the retail business and that's why the software business is so important.
BULL33|The high visible revenue growth stream this backlog growth even reporting to between 40 and 60% backlog gives investors encouragement that when the E Commerce business slows in it well in the second half that the software business continues to power forward.
BULL34|With extremely high margins and visible revenue.
NEUT35|Secondarily, the advertising revenue again, advertisers are flocking to this platform.
NEUT36|That is a high margin business.
NEUT37|So again, we don't want to emphasize the retail business.
NEUT38|But we think there are other engines of growth that keep Amazon at altitude.
NEUT39|They're not going to lose altitude because they have all these other businesses.
NEUT40|Then no other retailer has Brent Phil.
BULL41|Thanks so much for joining us, much appreciated.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
