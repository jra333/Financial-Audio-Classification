NEUT0|"""Look at shares of PG and E recapping the news that we've heard this morning already."
BULL1|That stock was up pretty significantly earlier this morning.
BULL2|It was up by as much as 18% at one point on reports that Berkshire Hathaway was interested in buying Proctor, PG and E. We spoke with Warren Buffett this morning.
NEUT3|He said that is 100% not true.
NEUT4|He also said he would know if that were true, so again, those rumors that have been out there that had been circulated.
BEAR5|Some reports that this was a potential for happening.
NEUT6|Not the case.
BEAR7|You can see that stock has come back down pretty significantly since then.
BULL8|It's still up by about $0.57, which is a gain of two.
NEUT9|2 3/4% but that news that Berkshire Hathaway was looking to buy PG and E is not accurate.
BEAR10|Obviously this company that struggled and had a lot of issues since the fires in California energy business.
BEAR11|There under a lot of threat and just the future of this company under huge.
NEUT12|Yeah, and the reason I think you could see the stock being twitchy is nobody's quite sure of an end game here, and how much value is going to be left for shareholders?
NEUT13|What's interesting, in a way, is how much stock did go up in response to these rumors.
NEUT14|The headlines coming from, you know, sources not necessarily considered to be authoritative, and by the way, I would love to know what was the last Warren Buffett acquisition that got into the market before the deal was done.
NEUT15|I don't think that's very common for them to be sniffing around a word to get out.
NEUT16|Take a troubled company, combine it with Warren Buffett's name, spread a couple of rumors on social media, get the word out there.
NEUT17|You get the stock reaction in, you know something that clearly needs.
NEUT18|I don't want to use the word bailout, but need some form of financial market rescue.
NEUT19|You can always say that Berkshire is buying or selling like a stock or as an invest 'cause you don't know whether it's hot or one of those other guys they were talking.
NEUT20|This was an acquisition acquisition.
NEUT21|Could an acquisition be done without equipment?
NEUT22|And that's what Warren special this happens.
NEUT23|In fact we didn't have time to really put the Deco.
NEUT24|His quote exactly was.
NEUT25|That's 100% not true and I would know if it were true, right?
NEUT26|But if you found out he paired, is this taken something from one of those other guys?
NEUT27|It's possible he might not.
NEUT28|Be up to speed on every single thing, right?
NEUT29|But not not not not something like this.
NEUT30|He would know about an issue like that and he does not yet.
NEUT31|If you're acquiring this company, obviously you're sitting there figuring out what the longer term liabilities are going to be, and so fires and anything that's insurance proposition.
NEUT32|"Therefore it would be his man."""
