NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol EARS."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another very eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Big price, movement volume.
NEUT6|Although I will say that from a presentation standpoint a relatively tricky chart to talk about.
NEUT7|'cause there's a lot of perspective that goes into.
NEUT8|What do I mean by that?
BEAR9|Well, if you were some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalp or whatever you wanna call yourself and you bought somewhere up around here and your plan was to buy and sell within 20 minutes, well then from that point of view from that perspective, the chart now looks really, really bad.
NEUT10|Now, if you care about things from the bigger picture point of view, understand from these highs.
BULL11|There has been a larger pullback, but from the grand scheme of it all the price the still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT12|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed is higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time.
NEUT13|And that's why in my mind, and I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price actually comes down here to $4.50.
NEUT14|I cannot say it will come down to 450 behaves in that manner and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT15|Now what would you have in this situation?
NEUT16|Emphasis on big picture.
NEUT17|Well, you'd have a set of Lowe's right there.
NEUT18|You have low is there?
NEUT19|You'd have those down here.
NEUT20|And if you envision each one of those steps would have well from the big picture, you'd still very clearly have.
NEUT21|Those stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT22|And like I said, that's what it truly strong was going to do.
BULL23|It's going to make progress and show signs of progress and the quote unquote sign of progress in this case is at $4.50.
NEUT24|Again, I understand if you're if you're a day trader and you bought right there, then you don't care about these stair steps.
NEUT25|So that's why I try to offer up a warning that I would be coming on things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT26|So yeah, today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here, you can see the price.
BULL27|The still have plenty of opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT28|So let's see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird.
NEUT34|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT35|But in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
