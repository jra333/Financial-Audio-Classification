NEUT0|"""Hey, it's calling this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will a very nice move today on this one and the overall context before I start deleting stuff out is that that red line here has finally been broken.
NEUT5|Price got the break of it came down and then continued on up.
NEUT6|So that's the current context of things.
NEUT7|Is this resistance trendline which mean, I suppose by a more to those of you that have watched past videos, but nonetheless it's broken above it.
NEUT8|So there is a technical pattern and trend line breakout here, so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of those 'cause that service purpose.
NEUT9|But now the question becomes OK, yeah, that red line has been broken, but is this a true breakout?
NEUT10|Is there any sort of genuine power behind this breakout, or is this just one of these fake breakouts where the price acts like it wants to act strong?
NEUT11|And then all of a sudden just totally collapses and I have no idea if this is a true breakout or not, but a very helpful level an answering that is now going to be this one 2950 Mark and I'm not saying that all this is what's going to actually happen by just for explanation, saying let's say the price comes down to 129 fifty behaves in that manner and then continues on down.
NEUT12|What would that be doing to the price that would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out from.
NEUT13|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly signing true power, choose strength or anything like that.
NEUT14|But I mean to be fair, no price and just go straight up either.
NEUT15|So maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner.
NEUT16|Then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now all of a sudden what you have while you never said all those right there.
NEUT18|You have that settles down there.
NEUT19|If you envision each one of those is Terra steps well, hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT20|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT21|That's what it truly strong move is going to overtime is.
BULL22|It's going to make progress and again in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined at that green line.
NEUT23|There as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|It's all about that purple line.
NEUT25|There are now moving forward, which on my chart and notes are very well known.
NEUT26|The very famous 50.
NEUT27|Moving average you can see, it's already rejected the price a couple of times in its past.
NEUT28|Current value of that as well.
NEUT29|Just call it at the one 3165 Mark.
NEUT30|So watch that very closely, but All in all, like I said, got that Red line break, not just a question of can the price continue to build up on this momentum?
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you.
NEUT42|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
