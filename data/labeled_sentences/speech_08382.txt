NEUT0|"""Yes, it was."
NEUT1|So what we did was we analyzed the very large sample of bond sales in the structured finance market.
NEUT2|That's bonds that are backed by payments on commercial and residential mortgages, auto loans, student loans and the like.
NEUT3|And we wanted to see if there were signs of rating inflation.
NEUT4|So what we did was we looked at all six rating firms that are active in that market, not just.
NEUT5|There are some new ones.
NEUT6|There's some new ones right?
NEUT7|So come in since it was dominated by Fitch, S&P and Moody Moody.
NEUT8|Yeah, so after the financial crisis, three firms challenge them for market share.
NEUT9|Kroll, DDS and Morningstar, and what we found was that they showed a tendency to award higher grades when writing the same bonds.
NEUT10|Then the big three and part of that reason could be because if you're a smaller rating firm, if you want to get chosen to wait a deal issue are still get to control who hires.
NEUT11|They're the ones who hired the firms to rate the bonds, and so if you're not giving the most favorable grades, there's a less likely Soleimani was following the higher ratings, and that is how they were marketing themselves.
NEUT12|No, the money with the way we were eating agencies market themselves.
NEUT13|This is an analytical excellence.
BULL14|You know, we provide the best analytical, excellent service to customers to investors who they call their customers providing timely research and the like.
NEUT15|But at the end of the day, it's not the investors who pay for the ratings.
NEUT16|It's the bond issuers, and they have an incentive to pick the rosiest ratings because the higher the rating, the lower interest costs.
NEUT17|The more money the investment bank makes selling that.
NEUT18|Well, there are certain type of bonds that you found the most issue with.
NEUT19|Yeah, commercial mortgage resident.
NEUT20|Commercial mortgage backed securities.
NEUT21|See MBS is the one where we've heard a lot about rating inflation, and we looked in that market.
BEAR22|We saw those patterns were quite pronounced and we found some deals where you know it was pretty clear that the ratings that were assigned to them, you know just weren't merited is the problem.
NEUT23|As acute as it was, pre financial crisis, a lot of people as we said in the introduction, thought that this was a problem that had been hosed out of the system, but clearly it hasn't.
NEUT24|No, because it's same.
NEUT25|It's the same business model.
NEUT26|It's the one thing that main thing that Congress didn't change after the financial crisis is they said.
NEUT27|Hey issuers, you can still pay for the for the ratings and so that gives him leverage to decide who to pick.
NEUT28|And of course they have an incentive to pick the best ratings.
NEUT29|So because that wasn't fixed that whole dynamic is still there.
BEAR30|Now we're not seeing Maskout downgrades yet like we were in 2007, so maybe this is not as bad yet as it was back then.
BEAR31|But there certainly investors who worry that this shopping dynamic where issuers shop around for the best ratings that if it's left unchecked it could potentially lead to that again in the future.
NEUT32|So what's the lesson for investors?
NEUT33|Don't pay so much attention to those bond ratings.
NEUT34|Well, they'd like to, but no one has time to do their own research, right?
NEUT35|It's like, do you have time if you have a deal that has like a you know dozens of loans in it, they have time to look at every loan.
NEUT36|Or if you have a consolidated, you know if there's an analyst at a rating firm who's done that research for you that you know you can look at that and rely on it.
NEUT37|Do big investors still rely on the ratings to the same degree that as they did, or are they more sceptical things?
NEUT38|So professional, there's definitely more skepticism as one main thing we found was the record a lot of investors expressing skepticism about credit ratings.
NEUT39|But we also found that.
NEUT40|Not everyone has the time to do that.
NEUT41|Deep dive research on the loan.
NEUT42|So for example, in the mutual bond fund industry is $4.4 trillion.
NEUT43|"Most funds have investment mandates that make either direct or indirect references to credit ratings, which say you gotta have a rating from either one of the Big three, Moody's, S&P or fish, or you gotta have an investment grade rating and that means credit ratings more than a decade after the crisis are just as much entrenched in the fabric of Wall Street as they were back then, if not more."""
