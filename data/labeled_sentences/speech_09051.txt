NEUT0|"""Guys, let's bring up another story to Warren Buffett actually making some news over the weekend, announcing that Berkshire Hathaway has actually acquired a stake of slightly more than 5% in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies."
NEUT1|Those companies are itouch oh, Itochu Corporation Marubeni Corp, Mitsubishi Mitsui, and Sumitomo Berkshire actually acquired those Holdings over a roughly 12 month period through regular purchases on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
BULL2|Berkshire says that it intends to hold those investments for the long term and that it may actually increase the Holdings of any of the company.
NEUT3|To a maximum of 9.9%.
NEUT4|However, Buffett said that he would not go above that threshold unless given specific approval by the trading companies boards of directors.
NEUT5|This investment is a big one for Berkshire.
NEUT6|A 5% stake in each of those companies would be valued at about 6:00 and a quarter billion dollars and collectively.
NEUT7|If you look at that as one bet that puts his bet on Japan at about his 7th largest holding just above Wells Fargo.
NEUT8|Based on the most recent regulatory filings, he's been selling.
NEUT9|Wells Fargo.
NEUT10|We know that in the second quarter, he unloaded about 25% of the Holdings that he had in that company, which has been a long term holding for his.
NEUT11|And of course, his largest holding is Apple.
NEUT12|That company is now valued.
NEUT13|His share has taken that company is now valued at about $90 billion.
NEUT14|And this all happened on his 90th birthday.
NEUT15|So it just goes to show that he is constantly changing the way he thinks an changing the way he invests.
NEUT16|He did say that this is a bet he's delighted to have Berkshire Hathaway participate in the future of Japan and the five companies that they've chosen for this investment.
NEUT17|Those five major trading companies, by the way, are very crucial in Japan.
NEUT18|They import everything from food and textiles and energy into a.
NEUT19|Country that is scarce and resources so they play a key role in a lot of those imports.
BULL20|For this he says that the five major trading companies have lots of joint ventures throughout the world, and they're likely to have more of those partnerships.
NEUT21|And this is a quote from him.
BULL22|He says, I hope that in the future there may be more opportunities of mutual benefit.
NEUT23|By the way, another example of Buffett kind of shaking things up and surprising people he had long said that he wouldn't invest in technology companies because he didn't understand technology companies.
NEUT24|He bought his first shares of Apple just about just over four years ago.
NEUT25|That was back in May in 2016, so it just goes to show that when you think you know what he's going to do, he will change and Dodge.
NEUT26|And this is a pretty different take.
NEUT27|A different move that a lot of people I'm sure would not have expected.
NEUT28|Yeah, Becky.
NEUT29|I mean going announced.
NEUT30|Going with the opportunities are also implicitly, I mean about not just on Japan, but on global trade.
NEUT31|And on, you know, on ages and continued importance in all of that.
NEUT32|It reminds me a little bit in the early 2000s he bought a big stake in Petro China, which at the time was a very big departure, and he had actually very good trade.
BEAR33|"He sold it and I think 2007 or 6 so you know, not the first time he's he's in that part of the world, but it's definitely a new wrinkle in terms of his thinking it seems."""
