BULL0|"""Alan, Iran and the international Goushi Aters are close to reaching some sort of agreement about monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities and hence potentially lifting some of the sanctions."
BULL1|Is this going to create an opportunity for international investment in Iran?
NEUT2|I think so.
NEUT3|First of all, the obvious place to look for the international oil companies, a couple of which are rumored to be poking around and trying to restart their efforts of the past.
NEUT4|Shell Eni of Italy have been mentioned.
NEUT5|Totale has been there in the past so that I think we'll hear more about that over the coming year.
NEUT6|But in other areas of interest might be the Iranian stock market.
NEUT7|Couldn't investors invest in knots?
NEUT8|And it's not really clear.
NEUT9|Manages no, no, really and.
NEUT10|First of all, it isn't on any benchmark and no matter what, fund managers will tell you if it is in at least the mssi frontier, it's it's probably going to always be a very exotic investment anyway.
BEAR11|But with sanctions that makes it that much more difficult to invest there.
NEUT12|And what kind of market is it in Iran and what kind of stock market to have its electronic trading and has for quite a long time?
NEUT13|It's what they call T + 2 trading, so trade date plus two, so it's.
NEUT14|Pretty modernized as far as I can tell.
NEUT15|Cheap is cheap.
NEUT16|Is training about five times earnings, which is about half of what the MCI Frontier Markets Index trades on.
BULL17|So yeah, not bad, 14% dividend yield.
NEUT18|Again not bad 14%, but how does that compare to inflation?
BULL19|Very good point.
NEUT20|It's about the same as inflation, so you're getting if you're lucky about a 1% yield real yield.
NEUT21|And there are some other things to think about that low P is probably biased down by some sectors, which it is fairly heavy in mining, say in certain financials.
BEAR22|Which are, you know, 10 to be not always pretend to be globally lower P stocks these days so.
NEUT23|There might be an element of that too, but frankly it is cheap, right?
NEUT24|So if the brave, it's an interesting prospect, but will it all be one way traffic here?
NEUT25|That's another good question.
NEUT26|Right now, some fund managers would say, well, some of what you see happening in say, the Middle East in the UAE market.
BULL27|It's done fairly well, maybe due to anticipating Iranian outflows of capital.
NEUT28|That's a possibility to consider certain sanctions that have prevented money from easilly leaving Iran as well as coming in so.
NEUT29|It could, it could work both ways.
NEUT30|It's not a one way street, but I guess investors in frontier markets and or semi frontier markets already know about these risks.
BULL31|"Alan thanks very much."""
