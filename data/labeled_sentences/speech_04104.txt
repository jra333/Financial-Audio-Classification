NEUT0|"""Age play in this via video chart on ticker symbol ISO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT6|Although summarizing today's price, movement in trading jargon, this is what I would call a gap in trap.
NEUT7|What do I mean by that?
NEUT8|In case maybe new charts?
NEUT9|Well on Thursday the price closed right there and then this morning the price opened up there.
NEUT10|Hence what is known as a gap up and then after the opening Bell Rang, the price showed some signs of life, made a bit of a move up to that area and then this is where things get Savage.
NEUT11|'cause you know there's some poor souls buying up around here.
NEUT12|And then from that point it was just basically all selling pressure.
NEUT13|The rest of the day.
NEUT14|So that's the gap in trap that is taking place, which now brings about, you know what I would definitely consider a very important level of support moving into next week down there at $12.30.
NEUT15|And I'm not saying this was going to actually happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT16|Saying if the price were to come down at 12:30, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT17|Well, from a very literal POV.
NEUT18|That would be putting the price quite literally right back inside of that range of the chart that it just broke out from.
NEUT19|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT20|Or said another way, that would imply that the price made a very very nice move up there to then go right back to where it was again just not a sign of true power.
NEUT21|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but that is why in my mind.
NEUT22|12:30 is a very important level to watch moving for now in the event the price decides it wants to try to turn itself around where some of these areas of resistance at first key area, resistance on any sort of attempted bounce back to the upside.
NEUT23|Going to be right there at $13.25 and then if the price can push up through 1325 next key level after that would be up there right around $13.75.
BULL24|So overall yeah, rough day with the gap in trap, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around or not moving forward.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL28|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT33|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
