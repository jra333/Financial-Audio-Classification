BEAR2|OK, it's Monday, June 24th and I am feeling the market pulling back tomorrow on the Tuesday.
NEUT3|An I think Netflix is due for a pullback, but one thing I notice is look at this resistance of 375 so you can see here.
NEUT4|Always looking for stuff like this.
BULL5|Boom price came up.
NEUT6|Hit that exact price and then pulls back.
NEUT7|So I think this is due for a.
NEUT8|A drop.
NEUT9|So I'm going to look to sell this stock, meaning short this stock will see how it goes in the coming days.
NEUT10|OK, it's several days later, I'm looking at Netflix stock, so here I talked about that resistance off of 375.
NEUT11|Anytime you see a stock come up, hit a whole number like 375 or maybe just below it.
NEUT12|Maybe it hits 374-9998 and then it comes down like this with the long upper Wick and we have this gap from the moving average.
NEUT13|All this space in here.
BULL14|It's almost a guarantee that this stock is going to pull back, so I was pretty sure that if I got in short that I'd make money.
NEUT15|The next day on the 25th, and that's exactly what I did.
BEAR16|I knew it was just going to be a one or two day hold back because I was overall bullish on the market.
BEAR17|So I got in short on the 25th and I got out the very same day.
NEUT18|Typically price is going to want to come back down to the moving average.
NEUT19|It may touch it completely.
NEUT20|It may go through it, or it may just get close to it.
NEUT21|Here Price went right through it and then obviously you can see we turned around.
BULL22|And it's more or less setting up bullish from here.
NEUT23|That's how stocks move.
