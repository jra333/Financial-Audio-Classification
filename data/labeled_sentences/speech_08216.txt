BEAR0|"""Without freedom of speech, the economy will shrivel."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times.
BEAR2|Freedom of speech explicitly guaranteed in the First Amendment of the Constitution is under assault from numerous universities, employers, cultural institutions, websites, and ironically, an astonishingly in much of the media itself.
NEUT3|Media types should know better are comparing speech control to gun control.
BEAR4|Too much free speech is dangerous, they aver.
NEUT5|A luxury we can no longer afford.
BEAR6|What's taking place is the **** Ling or outright suppression of speech that certain groups or individuals find objectionable or simply disagree with the consequences of non conformity are real, including potential loss of 1's job and public ostracism and shaming.
NEUT7|This is poison for democracy and for future economic prosperity.
NEUT8|After all, who determines what views are acceptable today?
NEUT9|Democrats are in charge and many are pushing for restrictions on free expression, but the Republicans will eventually come back to power to these far left, Democrats want a situation where the far right can determine what opinions and ideas are acceptable and punish those who don't conform to them.
NEUT10|What isn't always so well appreciated is that freedom of expression goes hand in hand.
NEUT11|With economic progress, a society that restricts speech will restrict freedom ascential to the creativity and experimentation that lead to inventions and innovations that raise humanity.
NEUT12|Standard of living here is just one example among countless others.
NEUT13|For decades it was an iron rule of medicine that also were caused by stress, spicy foods, and excessive acid.
NEUT14|Expensive drugs were made on that basis, as were awful dietze.
NEUT15|Then in the early 1980s a pair of Australian physicians challenge that belief and concluded that peptic ulcers could be cured with antibiotics and outrage.
BEAR16|Medical establishment ridiculed and dismissed these findings.
NEUT17|This was the kind of misinformation today's would be.
NEUT18|Sensors would have suppressed.
NEUT19|In 2005, the two men were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
NEUT20|In a free society, individuals from the most unlikely backgrounds can invent, innovate and constantly improve products and services and go up against powerful and established interests.
NEUT21|It was not aristocrats, potent politicians, or University graduates who launched.
NEUT22|The Industrial Revolution was most often tinkers and mechanics who feel the discoveries that improve the human condition.
NEUT23|What noted historian Deidre McCloskey calls the great enrichment.
BEAR24|For centuries, the average individual income stayed stuck at $3 a day.
NEUT25|That's adjusted for inflation in the US.
BULL26|Today is well over $150.
NEUT27|Freedom of expression is essential for our well being.
NEUT28|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT29|Thank you for listening.
BULL30|"Do send in your comments and suggestions and look forward to being with you soon again."""
