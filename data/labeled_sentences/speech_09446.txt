NEUT0|"""We kind of know the reasons why here, but you're thinking maybe a little bit differently this time around."
NEUT1|Or the same the same thing, no, no, we're going much different.
NEUT2|Alright, so what's my swing for the fences?
NEUT3|I'm talking.
NEUT4|The obituary has been written for this time and time again Crypto is dead.
BEAR5|I don't think so were down nearly 40% in the past year or rebound is underway.
NEUT6|I'm going Bitcoin for next year old.
NEUT7|Play bold play.
NEUT8|Alright, so I mean, what?
NEUT9|What is the bullish thesis there is so much skepticism out there isn't even real this this ship is sailed.
NEUT10|I think this ship has sailed, gone down, sailed again and this is an upswing.
NEUT11|So what we've seen there's so many applications still there for it.
NEUT12|It's not going away.
NEUT13|I think that right now, we've already seen.
BULL14|It's gone up, I think about 15% and just last month were still going on.
BULL15|It's trending up.
NEUT16|So right now I'm not going to win with a 10% or 20% on a blue chip stock.
BULL17|I mean Disney is going to do well for me, but this is going to play where if it goes up 70% next year we get other crypto mania then.
NEUT18|In January versus like the exact opposite of the safe play that Bobby Flay has been trying to make right with Kraft Heinz and with Walmart, so Bitcoin and Disney guys, that's pretty aggressive.
NEUT19|Back over here I like the way owes is diversifying his portfolio between classic senior growth stock and something that's a wild card.
BULL20|"I think the man is really showing so lot."""
