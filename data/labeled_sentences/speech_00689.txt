NEUT0|"""Dan better news for you."
NEUT1|And they needed to rip the band aid off, look in the mirror, raise capital.
NEUT2|It's something that the near term positive.
NEUT3|And this is something the math didn't lie.
NEUT4|And that's why I think this is a positive that must contested the side or raise capital.
NEUT5|And we've said 3 billion.
BULL6|But you know it's called 2.3 billion and you'll see a near term relief rally on this news down is enough.
BULL7|I think it's a good start.
BULL8|Ultimately, we believe three to four billion is probably more in the sweet spot where investors want to see more.
NEUT9|We'd want to see from a capital perspective, but this is a big first start in terms of what they need to do.
BULL10|And obviously Musk has really started change his direction because the profitability profile, the cap ex needs, and just given the debt.
NEUT11|This is something they needed to do right here before this thing started.
BEAR12|The spiral is the fears were a major overhang on the stock, so down, just in terms that it cost of funding though.
BEAR13|Remember when the credit came to market last time a couple of years ago, the yield for that maturity for that duration for that credit rating was a record low.
NEUT14|It came in around 5.3%.
NEUT15|Now we're talking about 8%.
NEUT16|If these guys want to raise money, it's going to get more and more expensive, isn't it?
BEAR17|It's gonna get more and more expensive because of the numbers and right now if you look at the profitability profile model threes, that's why two Q is such an important quarter in terms of what that trajectory looks like, but no doubt they went from a position of strength to positional weakness in terms of what they could get the capital at, but the longer they wait, the more expensive that was going to go and look.
NEUT18|The Clock struck 12 and Musk realized it needed to hit the capital markets.
BEAR19|Plus the juvenile question of you, you downgraded the stock very recently in the last couple of weeks you called the call a debacle.
NEUT20|What more do you need to see to become somewhat more optimistic on this company?
BULL21|We need to see demand pick up the most importantly, comfort that this can be a profitable company in the second half of the year.
BEAR22|If there's no profitability going into fiscal twenty, all bets are off.
NEUT23|So that's why we need to see that.
NEUT24|But let's be clear, this was a big first Step 4.
BULL25|"Musk and Tesla and in my opinion is a net positive."""
