BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
BULL1|Welcome back.
NEUT2|He is a 7th of December 2020, Monday, the first day of the week we are at #47 Kusama Whitiker KSM so for Kusama against BTC.
NEUT3|OK wait, hang on.
NEUT4|We will look at it on CMC for customer gains BTC.
NEUT5|OK, also really that came in.
NEUT6|This really isn't exactly that bullish.
BULL7|Yeah, we rose up to 0.32, that's it.
BEAR8|Feels to me like we could be dropping level are right if customers start forming mountain ranges here, things are going to drop for summer.
NEUT9|We're not exactly sure yet, but if someone continues rising, then we're going to get valleys instead of mountains, so it all depends upon the strength that is coming in for cool summer.
BULL10|If summer remains strong great, then more likely than not we could continue higher, right?
NEUT11|We could start forming some sort of a bullish chart pattern over here.
NEUT12|An pump we could go higher.
NEUT13|However it is going to take several weeks, maybe even months, but it's not going to be one shot and we are not going to be going up in just one straight line right now.
NEUT14|It's going to take some time and so.
NEUT15|Yeah, I don't really see yet.
NEUT16|I'm not saying we can't go any higher, I'm just saying I don't really see any bullish moves coming in for Kusama SBC yet.
BULL17|If we could consolidate here will be longer than yeah, we could go higher, right?
NEUT18|But if you start dropping then that's it.
NEUT19|That's eight.
NEUT20|So be very careful about going to a trip to sleep, right?
BULL21|Let's move on to come against USD.
NEUT22|But before that, please give this video a like.
NEUT23|If you enjoyed it.
NEUT24|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think, in the comments be so focused on bargains USD this is not good.
NEUT25|Why is this not good?
BEAR26|We got a marginally higher high, marginally higher highs are bearish divergences.
BEAR27|Look at this higher high on the price, but lower high on the mic D lower high under RSI.
NEUT28|There's already a crossover happening so.
BEAR29|Are we going to start dropping from here?
NEUT30|No guarantees, but more likely than not.
BEAR31|When you see a higher high on the price but lower high on the median RSI, this is already a job or bearish divergance, which means that Kusama could be dropping.
NEUT32|It could be, doesn't mean would we could still hang around here and we should still get a triple bearish divergance first before dropping.
NEUT33|We may not even drop, but my point is that strength is disappearing for who Sama?
BEAR34|It is, getting weaker.
BULL35|Not saying you can't go any higher, but you could really see that strength is getting quicker.
BULL36|Yes, the trend is still looking pretty bullish, right?
BULL37|We are still rising training, still bullish.
BEAR38|We have not switched into a bearish trading at the train is still bullish, but the strength is disappearing.
NEUT39|So yeah, again we need.
NEUT40|I mean, the wheels of Osama will have to collect energy.
NEUT41|We have to move sideways for a little while longer first before we can go any higher.
BEAR42|If we just keep rising and rising and rising year, there's going to be a big slap coming on.
NEUT43|Like something like this year.
BULL44|It would be a big step.
NEUT45|Surprised select.
NEUT46|After that we drop right.
NEUT47|But again the Chinese New police.
NEUT48|We have not switched berries yet, so yeah, but you know this is like a sign danger side and you know there's a danger sign as you're driving and you see danger sign like what in the yeah?
NEUT49|So double double verify which is a sign of danger.
NEUT50|Things could be reversing so again in terms of trading are doing this is a go no go no go for me for I mean in terms of trading so yeah.
NEUT51|Be very careful about going to trade too soon.
NEUT52|Things also very over, but if you look at the stock stick so so so so overbought, so eventually you're going to see, retrace as well.
NEUT53|The question is when alright?
NEUT54|I guess it from my customer tickle analysis.
BULL55|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL56|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT57|"I'll see you in the next week."""
