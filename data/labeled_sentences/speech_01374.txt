BEAR0|"""All three of them are already suffering really quite obviously, I mean Australia."
NEUT1|We've got the RBA decision next week cutting, yeah for sure.
NEUT2|As far as we can tell, and then probably a bit more.
NEUT3|After that career.
BEAR4|I mean, it just looks bad.
BEAR5|The export side looks awful.
BEAR6|Domestic economy looks terrible, annulations low tomorrow.
NEUT7|Yeah, but they should.
NEUT8|I'm not allowed to say that the economy would really benefit from a cut.
NEUT9|Let me put it that way.
NEUT10|It's so obvious now that haircut is coming that I really don't understand the rationale for leaving it until July when the next meeting is there would be far more benefits.
NEUT11|The economy from a cut now and the arguments were not doing that seem to be wrapped up in terms of things that all well there might be capital flight.
BEAR12|The one like might weaken good.
NEUT13|This is the monetary transmission mechanism at work.
NEUT14|That's how you get your economy pushing up a little bit more capital flight this is.
NEUT15|A current account surplus country, it doesn't matter, but would you do it between the tree Japan is in the worst situation because they've been grappling with this significant slowdown.
NEUT16|There's been no fractional economy forever.
BEAR17|The BOJ has run out of ammunition.
NEUT18|I mean, they're talking about being an easing mode again for a prolonged period of time.
BULL19|Yeah, yeah, seen as a safe haven trade.
NEUT20|There's not much leverage that they can.
BULL21|Japan is doing doing OK relative to to the others in some respects.
NEUT22|I mean the growth numbers have actually been back on GDP and is this important or not but.
BEAR23|She been all that bad for Japan, considering you know what, what it's likely to achieve a potential.
NEUT24|Yeah, the BOJ goes hot and cold on doing more, more easing and then doesn't and then talked about things like, well, actually, perhaps we should have a flexible interpretation of an inflation target.
NEUT25|Yeah, for sure 2% was never sensible.
NEUT26|You should be aiming at zero is a moving target sun moving target?
NEUT27|Actually it it raises a broader question about everybody else who's failing to achieve their inflation and still trying desperately hard to sort of get get somewhere which when when unemployment rates.
BULL28|Across the board, Japan is another good example.
BEAR29|Incredibly low labor market.
NEUT30|Nice and tight.
NEUT31|Why are we bothering?
NEUT32|So it would be helpful if they stopped doing some of these things.
NEUT33|So if you look at the if you look at Asia as a whole, then where would you put your money?
NEUT34|If you had to pick one country, where would you put it as a question?
NEUT35|I really should have anticipated in advance and happen.
NEUT36|It's probably easier to do by process of elimination.
NEUT37|I will tell you OK, so somewhere doesn't appear to be do your process of elimination out loud, so we've got some sense of what you like, what you do.
BEAR38|North Asia is suffering quite hard.
NEUT39|A combination of the global tech slump, which I think is really important and usually overlooked in preference of the trade war.
NEUT40|But the trade war as well.
NEUT41|And Southeast Asia is often very heavily exposed to the semiconductor business electronics, which again isn't helpful, so you've ruled out almost all of it.
NEUT42|So you're looking around for where might actually do.
BULL43|OK, Philippines Springs to mind growing nice and strongly.
NEUT44|We've got some accommodative monetary policy there is growing faster than China these days, so if I have to pick one, well, yeah, yeah.
NEUT45|I mean, it's one of the ones that often put at the top of the list of China really good.
NEUT46|Long run story.
NEUT47|If you're talking five years and certainly be in in my top three list there for.
NEUT48|Somewhere to look at.
