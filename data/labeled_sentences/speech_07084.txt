NEUT0|"""Yeah, I'm not surprised given what you've seen in terms of the environment uncertainty."
NEUT1|I think ultimately this is really the drum roll to the main event.
NEUT2|the Super cycle going into the holiday quarter as well as 2021.
NEUT3|We think preorders are more than two X iPhone 11.
NEUT4|I think if you look at this quarter from a services perspective, an iPhone and underlying in terms of what we're seeing in China, that's really the bull thesis over the next 6-12 months.
NEUT5|I think it would not.
NEUT6|It would have been imprudent for them, you know, to ultimately give guidance.
NEUT7|Given the variables as we go into the next 3-4 months.
NEUT8|So you see this as a buying opportunity stock given back at least all of today's gains, and then some Dan idea is a Golden buying opportunity because to me you're going into a once in a decade super cycle in terms of 5G, iPhone 1240% of the base has an upgraded phone 3 1/2 years and that's why I think many investors view this quarter as sort of ho hum looking next six to nine months.
NEUT9|I view this as a stock 150 in the next 6 to 9 months I'd be buying here.
NEUT10|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT11|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
