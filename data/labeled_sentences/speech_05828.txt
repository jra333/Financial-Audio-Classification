NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol R MBL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day in this one, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume man, well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So let's just state the you know the obvious thing right now.
BEAR8|The last 30 minutes of the day got really, really nasty.
NEUT9|Big red candle here, so does that destroy the entire chart?
BEAR10|No, it doesn't destroy the entire chart, but I mean, it certainly makes the chart look a little shaky right now.
NEUT11|Because that you know, again, not the end of the world, but it now becomes a more than rational and more than valid thought to be having now is this the start of something much bigger?
BULL12|To the downside, an A level that really stands out to me as an important level of support now is going to be this previous breakout point right here at $24.00 Mark, which did do a good job of wholeness supports.
NEUT13|I mean, a quick trip down memory Lane you can see right there earlier on in the day that was right where it acted as resistance, but once the price did get the break of there, and that's what really launched it to.
NEUT14|Quite frankly a very crazy move.
BULL15|And then I'll send it pulled back, but at least it bounced from that area.
NEUT16|But you're going to have lots of people watching the $24.00 mark.
NEUT17|And I emphasize lots of people, because when that's the case, I mean, it's not a guarantee of anything but called his cell phone, self fulfilling prophecy or whatever.
BEAR18|But I mean, if the price were to come down below that level, that could create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
BULL19|Again, not a guarantee, but in my opinion of $24.00 breaks then I would expect it to take another pretty decent move to the downside, potentially even going down to retesting those lows right there at 1835.
NEUT20|So 24 and then 1835 two main areas of support in the event the price tries to bounce first, the level of resistance.
NEUT21|Keep an eye on right up there at the $30 mark and then after $30 next he level up there.
NEUT22|Right around the $36 mark.
BEAR23|But yeah, very very shaky looking chart now after that last 30 minutes.
NEUT24|But early next week certainly going to be very interesting.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird.
NEUT30|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT31|But in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT35|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
