NEUT0|"""We're going to go back this back."
NEUT1|We're going in this case.
NEUT2|We're going from latch, which is the smart Lock company that's pushing broader into smart home systems.
NEUT3|It is going public through us back today, and Robert Frank joins us with the details and a special guest, Robert.
BULL4|Thank you Andrew.
NEUT5|Good morning.
NEUT6|This pack attack does continue now.
NEUT7|Global real estate developer Tishman Speyer announcing earlier this morning it's going to acquire real estate startup Latch that's Innospec deal, valuing valuing latch at more than $1.5 billion.
NEUT8|Joining us now in a CNBC exclusive is Rob Speyer.
NEUT9|He is Tishman Speyer President and CEO Anne Luke Schoenfelder.
BULL10|He is Lattice CEO and founder, guys, thanks for joining us and congratulations on this deal this morning.
NEUT11|Rob, I want to sort of pick up where.
NEUT12|Pick up where Joe left off with this whole spec sentiment and valuations and what it says about the market today.
NEUT13|There are now, I guess.
NEUT14|Nearly 300 specs chasing $90 billion worth of deals.
NEUT15|What do you make of the valuations?
NEUT16|I guess latch in 2019 was valued at $400 million.
NEUT17|After this deal it will be valued at 1.5 billion.
NEUT18|Does that valuation?
NEUT19|Do these valuations make sense to you?
NEUT20|We've been a customer, an investor in in latch for years and our customers, the people who live in our buildings.
BULL21|They love the product, so we've rolled it out across our residential portfolio and we think we can be a thought partner and a product incubator.
NEUT22|Help him into new markets like Europe, help them into new verticals like commercial office.
NEUT23|There are great company and our customers wanted and that's the bottom line.
NEUT24|And even before this, back in this deal, Tishman Speyer had invested in, I guess, about a dozen startup companies that are in property tech.
NEUT25|You've said often that property in real estate is way behind the times when it comes to technology.
NEUT26|What do you think needs improving in both commercial and residential real estate?
NEUT27|An where do you see the industry headed beyond latch?
NEUT28|Well, we've been a tech phobic tech resistant industry for decades, and now our customers are demanding it.
NEUT29|They want us to make their lives easier, happier, more productive, and it's going to be entrepreneurs like latch and companies like an entrepreneurs like Luka.
NEUT30|Nine companies like latch that are going to lead the way they are providing the customers that the products that our customers demand an is as an industry.
NEUT31|We need them as an R&D arm to help us achieve those ends.
NEUT32|And look, I want to bring you in.
NEUT33|You know if you look at I guess revenue in 2020 was around 18 million.
NEUT34|You had a loss of about 61 million an yet again the valuation of this company posed deal will be $1.5 billion.
NEUT35|What do you make of that?
NEUT36|Valuation doesn't make sense.
NEUT37|Yeah, so when you look at our revenue profile so many of our deals sort of follow the way that our customers like to purchase products which is 18 to 24 months in advance.
NEUT38|When you're building a new building or you're renovating, you know major parts of your portfolio were there as a partner to develop the product that you're going to need.
NEUT39|You know 18 months from now and for the next 10 years.
NEUT40|And so if you look at our booked revenue, we really look at that as the indicator of of our growth and our forward progress.
NEUT41|An are the customer excitement around our products and.
NEUT42|One out of 10 apartments in the United States were built with our products last year.
NEUT43|We're just getting started.
NEUT44|There's so much more to come.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
