NEUT0|"""My bigger fear is contrary to what Jay Powell says, the Federal Reserve that, even though we're not thinking about ever thinking about everything about raising interest rates, inflation is going to raise its ugly head inflation."
NEUT1|And we're going to go from less than 2% to three, 4% to 5% because you can't print all this ******* money without it causing inflation.
NEUT2|21% of all the money since the beginning of time was printed this year.
NEUT3|I mean, if the average little guy that owns a ******* coffee shop.
NEUT4|Or a ******* Starbucks they would **** and the new president.
NEUT5|There's 600 bucks that they were the president is handing out is insulting my $1200 check is up there.
NEUT6|I didn't cash it, but they sent me.
NEUT7|Now they're saying they should give him $2000 or 3000, but I'm so distant how $600 can help a family of four.
NEUT8|I don't know, but it can.
NEUT9|I don't believe it can.
BULL10|But 2000 is better than 600 for sure.
NEUT11|But I know the kids that are getting these checks that are going in buying options and buying derivatives and it's not going to anybody that that really needs it.
NEUT12|And rich people.
NEUT13|I'm the only rich guy I know and I know a lot of rich guys that is not.
NEUT14|They didn't collect any money, government, money or I got that check which I didn't get.
BEAR15|But we could have made everybody redundant and God put him on the government paycheck.
NEUT16|We didn't do that, they have to work and we paid in full full tilt.
NEUT17|And that's what it's supposed to be.
NEUT18|It wasn't for the Lakers to get $12 million.
NEUT19|It wasn't for a De Niro to get $7 million for his restaurants.
NEUT20|That's not what it was for.
NEUT21|"It was for the guys that owned the restaurants that can't afford, but as usual the government ****** it up."""
