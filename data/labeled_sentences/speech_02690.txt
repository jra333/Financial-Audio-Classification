BULL0|"""Equity markets had a great 2019, but it was not based on earnings growth earnings on average across the companies in the indexes grew very slowly in 2019 and will probably have only modest gains in 2020."
BULL1|That 2019 rally depended on two factors, declining rates and an easing of trade tensions.
BULL2|Way back in 2018 September of 2018, the Fed was guiding that rates would rise throughout 2019.
BEAR3|Then came the near 20% correction in equities in Q4 2018 and the Fed shifted gears and early 2019. the Fed put rates on hold and then fears about the global economy led to several rate cuts.
NEUT4|Later in 2019, equities love rate cuts as they allow for higher price earnings or PE ratios.
NEUT5|You don't need earnings growth on the trade front.
BULL6|The cease fire in Q4 2019 and the announcement of a Phase One trade deal between the US and China helped lower risks.
BULL7|An lower risks means higher P ratios even without earnings growth.
NEUT8|The 2020 Crystal Ball is about as murky as one can get.
BEAR9|the Fed has rates on hold given current economic conditions, so if we get lower rates in 2020, it will not be for a good reason.
BEAR10|But because economic data will have deteriorated and be suggesting a recession, then there are global tensions uncertain.
BEAR11|Oil prices, future elections and a lack of confidence by business to expand investment coming off an exceptionally good year in 2019, a repeat performance would be quite amazing.
NEUT12|But then a lot of folks were worried about equities when 2019 began.
NEUT13|Still 2020 is not likely to be a smooth ride, as the Bulls and Bears will have a lot to digest as the news ebbs and flows.
