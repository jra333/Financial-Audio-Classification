BULL0|"""Everyone welcome back to Red's Roundup."
NEUT1|In this video, we're looking at the Snowflake IPO and how the events of the past few days with the IPO coming to market have unfolded.
NEUT2|So quick reminder, go watch my other video for a more in depth overview of what Snowflake does for now.
NEUT3|Quick overview.
NEUT4|There are data in cloud based company.
NEUT5|They enable companies to use and store data on the cloud and as a cloud based data warehouse.
NEUT6|So a lot of cloud data, AI, all that type of stuff.
NEUT7|I don't know a whole lot more about it if you know more leave me a comment in the comments.
NEUT8|So moving on.
NEUT9|What did Berkshire Hathaway do, Berkshire?
NEUT10|Is buying $250 million worth of stock in the private placement?
NEUT11|It already has bought it and it also agreed to buy 4,000,000 shares from former Snowflake CEO.
NEUT12|And that should make Berkshire steak at around.
BULL13|2 1/2 to 2.6%.
NEUT14|Of the business.
NEUT15|Now here's the key.
NEUT16|It wasn't Buffett who bought the shares.
NEUT17|It was Todd Combs.
NEUT18|His signature was on the S1 forum.
NEUT19|I believe that's the form that you have to submit for IPO.
NEUT20|And so that's that's what it was.
NEUT21|He's a manager at Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT22|He manage is about $13 billion.
NEUT23|And as you can see his credentials here, he's age 46 and he graduated from Columbia.
NEUT24|So here, let's look at some snowflake IPO or my bad.
NEUT25|The Snowflake ticker stock chart.
NEUT26|So here we see.
NEUT27|The estimated price that Snowflake said the IPO was going to be coming in at in earlier September and August was actually $75.
NEUT28|But as you can see here on the left, this chart is in the $200 range.
NEUT29|So what happened?
BEAR30|So the snowflake IPO actually went public at 120 dollars, $125.00 that range and it increased in the first day all the way up to about $300 per share, which it quickly fell down from.
NEUT31|But then which afterwards it went up?
NEUT32|And now it's trading at around $230 per share.
NEUT33|But this is pretty insane that the IPO just IPO and then it doubled in price almost immediately.
NEUT34|That's that's pretty incredible.
NEUT35|So the buffet.
NEUT36|The Buffett deal not exactly the buffet deal.
BULL37|The Berkshire Hathaway Hathaway deal netted them a quick double.
NEUT38|Who knows if that will stay, but I have some other interesting stats for you.
BULL39|The IPO, actually, because the stock price went up so quickly it actually.
BEAR40|The Snowflake Company wasn't able to benefit from that, so they actually left over $3 billion on the table from this IPO.
NEUT41|And this is actually the largest initial public offering since Alibaba went public and they left a little over $3 billion on the table as well.
BEAR42|So that's that's pretty insane that this stock price doubled just after after going public.
NEUT43|This doesn't really mean much to me.
NEUT44|I'm not going to be investing in Snowflake anytime soon, and less the price goes.
BEAR45|Well, well below $100.
BEAR46|That would be a half more than 1/2 from current prices.
NEUT47|So that's what I have to say on the topic.
