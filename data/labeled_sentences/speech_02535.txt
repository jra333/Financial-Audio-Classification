NEUT0|"""Hi fools, Nicop or analysts at fool.com and today we're talking all about accompanies mode."
NEUT1|Now what is a Moat?
NEUT2|Will think about a sandcastle on the beach when you're building that beautiful Castle with all the Spires and all the different wings to it.
NEUT3|What you want to do is build a Moat around it to keep out any kinds of invasion.
NEUT4|And that's really what a corporate mode is.
NEUT5|It is the mechanism that helps keep a company's revenue an its profits away from competitors away from all sorts of.
NEUT6|Potential for destruction, and that's where you got to think about as an investor.
NEUT7|A company's Moat is what will keep you making money long into the future.
NEUT8|Now two quick examples that kind of illustrate the most characteristic are Google and Microsoft.
NEUT9|Now, on one hand you have Google, which is a company that's having great success.
NEUT10|Recently.
NEUT11|They're doing all sorts of things right, but when you know when you analyze the company through a competitive advantage perspective, an there which is the same thing as saying thermote, what's happening here?
NEUT12|Well, what you really have the way Google makes money is an ad engine.
BULL13|And I'm not sure Google has a sustainable mot once someone comes out with a better system, a better way of doing things.
NEUT14|The switching costs associated with using Google versus using something else are pretty low.
NEUT15|I mean, you can just start doing your searches in Bing, or you can use all sorts of other search engines.
NEUT16|Once that happens, Google's revenue stream.
BEAR17|There are massive numbers of net income and profits start to disintegrate a bit and that is worrisome.
NEUT18|As an investor now flip an look over at Microsoft, Microsoft Tools, Microsoft Office suite.
NEUT19|Microsoft's Connection Engine, Microsoft's ability get you into using a computer.
NEUT20|Affectively, that's something that people have known to use, and I've learned to use over the years.
NEUT21|If you're thinking about someone who uses Excel and has used it for a long time, they understand that system.
NEUT22|They don't really want to learn another system, and it's unlikely that those those transitions will be made very easily.
NEUT23|I look at Microsoft as being High Moat Company, and that's the difference between the two one you can switch away from fairly easily.
NEUT24|The other you can, and that translates into revenue that translates into.
NEUT25|Profit as a shareholder.
NEUT26|So what you really want to do as investor, look at a company's position.
NEUT27|Look at it, smote see if it has one and move on from there.
NEUT28|But first of all understand, does that mode exist?
NEUT29|That's what I have on motes today.
NEUT30|This is Nick Kapur.
BULL31|"Thanks very much."""
