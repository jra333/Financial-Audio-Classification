BULL0|"""Hi everyone already all doing."
BULL1|Hope you're doing well today.
NEUT2|I just want to bring a quick update on the Facebook stock.
NEUT3|I already did a full video explaining why I'm invested in this specific company, giving my reasons.
NEUT4|My fundamental analysis and as always is not financial advice.
NEUT5|I am just publicly documenting my personal investment decisions for one specific portfolio.
NEUT6|This is just a long term and all networth accumulation portfolio, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT7|Every time I make a decision or do to buy a share or something.
NEUT8|I posted my Instagram page credit.
NEUT9|Thought invest and then I decided to make some YouTube videos about it explaining why I'm doing so.
NEUT10|Anything that said I already did my fundamental analysis in the previous video where I said that the Facebook's fair value according to the DCF, discounted free cash flow method.
NEUT11|It was Facebook should be worth it.
NEUT12|Share should be worth around $327.00 an I bought them at 279 again that was before the Facebook earnings so I did.
NEUT13|All my predictions without knowing the Q4 of 2020, the last quarter of 2020 and I was a bit conservative in my expectations and now that we have access to the earnings reports of Facebook which were published in the 27th of January.
BEAR14|I had to re calculate or change some values in my Excel spreadsheet and now I think the verify fair value is around 339 more or less because they did beat my expectations.
NEUT15|But this talk is falling like crazy and I decide to buy another share at 257 point $0.50 and you can see it in my Instagram page exactly when I do it at what strike price and so on.
NEUT16|All those details that if you want to know if you're interested, consider checking the.
NEUT17|Space for that.
NEUT18|And yes, because this is a long term play and I do want to hold some shares of this specific company.
NEUT19|So instead of buying them at one specific point in time and just dollar cost averaging my position so I bought one at 279.
BEAR20|Now at 257, if the stock drops lower, I will continue buying.
NEUT21|If the stock goes higher, I will also continue buying.
NEUT22|I am just like averaging my costs because I do think this stock is really.
BULL23|Undervalued and and the earnings, the Mark Zuckerburg also threw some shade to Apple.
NEUT24|Maybe that's what's driving this talk down.
BEAR25|Also, there's the problem with the lawsuits.
NEUT26|The antitrust lawsuit to the monopoly claims and store so on and so forth, but I remain optimistic in this stock.
BULL27|Like I said in the previous video, I do expect a lot of volatility, at least in the short term.
NEUT28|This is not going to be easy stock tool because you will see all these fluctuations in the share price.
NEUT29|But that's my personal decision and I'm just sharing it with you.
NEUT30|"Tell me what you think and I'll see you in the next video, bye."""
