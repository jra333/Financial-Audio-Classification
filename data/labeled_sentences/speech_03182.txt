NEUT0|"""Any thoughts on fetch dot AI?"
NEUT1|FET OK, I'm not sure if this is on any major exchanges on Tradingview bill.
NEUT2|Maybe try to pull it up on your end.
NEUT3|Let me also check on token metrics and see if we can.
NEUT4|If we have this here.
NEUT5|Fench OK yeah.
NEUT6|So this was then.
NEUT7|This was the balance I owe.
NEUT8|Yeah, so this is the idea of the last year and it pretty much.
BEAR9|Has hasn't fared too well.
NEUT10|So.
NEUT11|We do have the TA models Sarti models are not bullish on all the very bearish at the moment.
NEUT12|Uhm?
NEUT13|All the customs are bearish.
NEUT14|Then let me check the price predictions.
NEUT15|Surprise prediction models.
NEUT16|Please bear with us.
NEUT17|It is taking some time to load.
BULL18|OK, so price reduction is OK, have been pretty.
BULL19|I'm pretty in alignment with the actual trend here.
NEUT20|In general, but price predictions are saying it's basically going to come.
BEAR21|Crashing all the way down to about $0.25.
BULL22|Bill, are you able to pull it up on your end?
NEUT23|I do.
NEUT24|I have it's coming OK. OK, so Jay, so here's the check here.
NEUT25|OK, so this is F ET right fetch dot AI.
NEUT26|OK, so I'm seeing this a lot right?
NEUT27|So.
NEUT28|We have it like a kind of a sort of famous term.
NEUT29|You know by breakouts, right?
NEUT30|So this is a tough one, but this looks like it's actually breaking out and can go.
NEUT31|Much higher, right?
BEAR32|It's not good News 453 right now.
NEUT33|It can probably go to 564.
BEAR34|You know it is going to run into a little bit of resistance at 500.
BULL35|That's an even number Anna Pryor peak.
NEUT36|OK, but as with all of these things.
NEUT37|You know, if you take a look at where these things came from.
NEUT38|Right?
NEUT39|And how long they've been deppressed?
NEUT40|Yeah, like you know how I'm always talking about the give up.
NEUT41|OK, there's your give up.
NEUT42|Alright, yeah, so there's your give up and then you know the the accumulation crowd comes in and that's your potential.
NEUT43|The bigger the base, the higher in the space, right?
NEUT44|So you know when I do these charts, you know, I don't.
NEUT45|I don't know the details about the project right?
NEUT46|I just know that there are these teams running across all the charts.
NEUT47|And.
NEUT48|You know, we don't advocate FOMO, but we are telling people to buy breakouts.
NEUT49|So this to me looks like it's breaking out right, which fits along with another theme we have of this altcoin move, you know, minus a crash in equities.
BULL50|This altcoin move can spread out.
NEUT51|Alright, I mean well said Bill was said, so let us know what you think.
BULL52|Do you think our fetch has a has a good traction and.
NEUT53|Is basically a candidate for to buy a breakout, or do you think it's?
NEUT54|It's basically still just kind of dormant?
NEUT55|Tell us what you think down in the comments below.
NEUT56|"OK."""
