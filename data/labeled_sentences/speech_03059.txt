BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the daily time frame now unless you live under a rock or in a cave or something.
BULL3|I'm sure you're well aware that Facebook had its earnings.
BEAR4|Facebook did not do well with its earnings and Facebook lot of loss.
NEUT5|A whole lot of market value today, so a lot of people talking about it.
NEUT6|So I just want to give you know, you know, kind of map out some technical levels here.
NEUT7|You know where the chart is currently.
NEUT8|Actually the prices at some very interesting levels.
NEUT9|So I want to focus on those and that first level that really stands out and I don't want to come across like these are some sort of great discoveries on my part.
NEUT10|Anybody that understands charts an uses them is going to be watching these same level, so this is not some sort of like I have.
NEUT11|All the secrets is nothing like that in that first key level is right down here at the 171 mark.
NEUT12|Why is 171 quite important?
NEUT13|Well if you go back here through the history of the chart you can see that 171 acted as resistance right there and then a very foundational rule in charting states when levels of resistance are broken and closed.
NEUT14|Above you want to see them access support.
NEUT15|So right there that level was broken up above closed above so you would want to see it access support.
NEUT16|And that's exactly what happened right there.
NEUT17|So just the classic example of resistance turning into support and now you Fast forward to today.
BULL18|Ensure the price isn't quite at this 171 mark, but I think we all agree you know it's getting within the range of it.
NEUT19|So 171.
NEUT20|Definitely a very important level going forward.
NEUT21|You know, for the foreseeable future, in the event the price cannot hold above there and there's a breakdown below it, no, no such thing as a guarantee, but at that point it would not be shocking at all to see the price drop down to, you know, right around 160 give or take, I mean.
NEUT22|Remember, we're talking about $160.00 stock, so I mean give or take, you know $0.50 or so, but right down there.
BEAR23|$1.60 could very well become in play, but it's kind of pointless in my opinion.
NEUT24|Right now I'd be talking about 160 when the price hasn't even tested this very important level.
NEUT25|They're at $1.71, but again, if I dollars 71 breaks, and especially if it's you know, push down through on higher volume, then yeah, at that point I would say 160 is very much so in play on any sort of bounce of the upside in the very near term.
NEUT26|It's really all about that pink line right there.
NEUT27|Which is the.
NEUT28|Very famous 200 day simple moving average.
NEUT29|So even if you have a very basic surface, deep understanding of charts, I'm sure you've heard of the 200 day moving average and you know that when prices are blow it, it does tend to act as resistance so by no means am I saying it's impossible to breakthrough that 200 day.
NEUT30|But you know, just traditionally speaking, usually the price really needs to bring its a game to get up above that level.
NEUT31|And right now that value is that right around one 8150 so 181.
NEUT32|Fifty will be that initial level to fight through on any sort of bounce.
NEUT33|The price can push through there.
NEUT34|Then yeah, things could be, you know, maybe generate some sort of.
NEUT35|You know continuation on a potential dead cat, but as things stand right now, you know top priority right now, in my opinion at least is not necessarily breaking resistance levels.
NEUT36|It's about stabilizing and finding some sort of bottom.
NEUT37|And we'll see if this, you know 171 or above can be that bottom or we'll see if the bears up some more energy and push it down and test 160, so the next couple of weeks should be very interesting to see how this all plays out.
NEUT38|One of the biggest questions I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT39|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT40|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT41|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part it's completely free.
NEUT42|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT43|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
