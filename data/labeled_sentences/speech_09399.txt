NEUT1|Hope you guys are doing good so I'll be giving you an update on CHDK Stop check, cut, stop and give you guys some key levels I'm looking at and also my future forecasts on check stock.

NEUT4|And I do plan on doing.
NEUT5|And give away, just say thank you for the love on the channel.
NEUT6|I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to do it, so I'm going to let you guys know.
NEUT7|Probably like next week on Monday or sooner.
NEUT8|So just lookout for that.
NEUT9|OK, so let's get into the video.
NEUT10|I had this resistance, then I had these two supports right?
BULL11|And as you can see I did send an alert out today for check we got in today with some shares and now I am looking for it to surpass this resistance level.
NEUT12|OK, as you guys know they've been trying to go through some US patents there.
NEUT13|See scan technology so everything goes good with that I am.
BULL14|Assuming the stock will shoot up, it did close around 169.
BULL15|It is up after market.
NEUT16|An Addison alert on my face on face and get below that.
NEUT17|So zoomed in a little bit so this is the part that I saw was 159 and $154.54 and Dollar 59.
NEUT18|As you can see it just bounce right through there.
NEUT19|It just traded sideways.
BULL20|All this consolidation was right on here so I'm thinking it was building up and now it's ready to go higher because it didn't want to go lower.
NEUT21|As you can see it really didn't want to go below that $1.44 area so I think it is time for it to start going up the stock.
NEUT22|Is a slow mover unless it has like a catalyst behind it to shoot it up like that.
NEUT23|And I think the catalyst will be like when their patent is secure.
NEUT24|Are some on the C scan output of it like what I was doing?
NEUT25|If you're doing good and stuff like that.
NEUT26|So just watch out for that stock, but this stock passes through this level.
BEAR27|That would be very bullish an I'll be holding past $3.
NEUT28|OK, so right now if it comes below here, I will get out the play and look for another entry.
NEUT29|But as long as it stays above these two lines, I'll be holding an I'll be holding for the $3 mark.
NEUT30|OK, so right now it's just been traded in here and we just waiting for that breakout.
