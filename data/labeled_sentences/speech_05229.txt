NEUT1|When will the market crash once and for all?
NEUT2|Wait, what was that see?
NEUT3|Welcome back to I buy real estate.
NEUT4|Your free step-by-step guy so you can buy real estate.
NEUT5|First, I want to state this in no way am I trying to or want to start a panic.
NEUT6|This is actually the opposite where I'm preparing you for what is inevitably going to happen.
NEUT7|Also as a disclaimer, I don't actually have.
NEUT8|A real crystal ball to actually know what will happen, but after studying previous crashes, market trends and gathering all this data, here are my predictions to when the market crash will take place.
NEUT9|If you look at the past two crashes 2001 and 2007 both happened around September, October period and if Trump becomes reelected 80% chance he will.
NEUT10|He won't need a helpful voters anymore.
NEUT11|You really think he's going to keep printing stimulus checks?
NEUT12|And keep the interest rates low.
NEUT13|It's all manipulation now to keep the economy afloat so he can get reelected if the market is not correcting this September October is very likely it will occur next year, now that you know the crash is coming.
NEUT14|What can you do to prepare number one, stabilize your finances?
NEUT15|Let me elaborate on that.
NEUT16|Make sure you have no high interest loans, hard money loans, high credit card debt.
NEUT17|Anything greater than 10% interest if you do, make sure to consolidate it now because interest rates are at an all time low and be sure to lock in your rates as fixed and not adjustable.
NEUT18|If you own real estate.
NEUT19|For example, sell anything that you don't want to hold long term long term meaning five to seven years or more.
NEUT20|Why?
NEUT21|Because it typically takes that long for the property value to recover.
BEAR22|Any real state in a bad neighborhood.
NEUT23|Bad neighbors too much repairs needed none or minimal producing asset or even bad tenants.
NEUT24|Those are just a few reasons and I myself have so four recently #2 is to have minimum the very minimum a year to two years worth of living expenses set aside.
NEUT25|You can't always depend on the government for stimulus checks, nor would you want to.
NEUT26|There's only one person you can depend on, and that is yourself now that we're number one and #2 are taken care of.
NEUT27|#3 is to have liquid cash available.
NEUT28|This is saying that when most people are running away from the Hills, winner winners run towards the fire.
NEUT29|This is in times like these, where mostly anything becomes 50% or even up to 75% off.
NEUT30|It's the best time to take our opportunities.
