NEUT0|"""If you had told me this morning that a large mall company would buy another mall company and double down, yeah, I would say that that could be fanciful."
NEUT1|And yet I wake up to a deal that I didn't dream of.
NEUT2|No, and I'm glad you brought it up.
NEUT3|It's worth 'cause we did have we stopped mentioning the top, the program, some M&A news, and this is led by this Simon property deal to acquire Taubman and your point.
NEUT4|Jim, the market agreed with you and everybody else agreed this is not going to happen.
NEUT5|This is a 52% premium, not on the unaffected stock price that you typically see, right?
BULL6|But on the affected stock price, tabin was up last week because there were some reports of potential talks between the two.
NEUT7|And this is on top of that, and so Simon obviously does see a significant entry point here that they were willing to pay in terms of consolidating, they're going to own 80% the Tubman family rolling in.
NEUT8|Eventually they have the right to or Simon has the right to buy their interest, so it's going to be separately managed innocence controlled by someone important to point out.
BULL9|But the overall price is going to add a bid to the entire sector solution, although this is all 8 + 8 mall Macerich up sharply this morning.
BULL10|Simon seems to be responding.
NEUT11|Positively is not something to the deal.
NEUT12|You know why I pulled up with David Simon.
NEUT13|I only I'm not.
NEUT14|I hope I'm not violating any off the record because I was headed DJ's all concert who's very good, but I'm not know if you're familiar with this work, ma'am, yes, but he's talking about $33 billion in dividends.
BEAR15|That Simon Properties is historically undervalued.
NEUT16|When I see that the stock goes up well, there's a way to raise the stock, not the dividend.
NEUT17|Yeah, an.
NEUT18|I think that when I went through the properties that Albin owns, I realized I've been to quite a few of the malls and they are the highest highest end.
NEUT19|But when was the last time?
NEUT20|Actually, pretty recently 'cause there's kind of a mile from my house, the mall at Short Hills and it is.
NEUT21|I went to return something how that that's all you need, but just need traffic.
NEUT22|But it's funny because when I heard this actually originally as a possibility, I did approach couple of my key guys in real estate who I sort of rely on for their insight, and they were like that doesn't make sense.
NEUT23|Make sense.
NEUT24|Look at anything that is a bit like domestic operation with not with no exposure to China.
NEUT25|You wake up and you say you know what I really gained this correctly.
NEUT26|And yet you knew you were wrong.
NEUT27|Until today the bandit cap rate is 6.2%.
NEUT28|That's reasonable Simon.
NEUT29|It just bought Forever 21.
NEUT30|You know, working in a way to buy a vulture and yet and also today's Sycamore buys and just to cure mall Denison.
BEAR31|Yeah, in Victoria's Secret so I came away saying I guess I'm just too negative on the thing.
BEAR32|I'm most negative about.
NEUT33|Which is the future of the mall?
NEUT34|The future?
NEUT35|"Yeah."""
