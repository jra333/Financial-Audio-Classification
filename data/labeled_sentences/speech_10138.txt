NEUT0|"""Introduction to fractional shares."
NEUT1|How to invest from just one pound.
NEUT2|This video is going to explain about fractional shares and show you how this feature enables you to invest small amounts with trading 212 in even the largest priced shares.
NEUT3|Let's go straight to the Trading 212 app on the home screen, we can see different lists of stocks tap on fractional shares.
NEUT4|Here you'll find a list of well known stocks, many of which cost hundreds of dollars.
NEUT5|For example, we have Amazon and Alphabet near the top, both of which cost well in excess of $1000.
NEUT6|The trouble with such large prices is that buying even just a single share requires you to invest a substantial amount of money in one company.
NEUT7|If we buy one loan share of Amazon, for example, it will cost us more than £1300.
NEUT8|That's a fair chunk of change.
NEUT9|Wouldn't it be nice then, if you could buy just a portion of a share instead?
NEUT10|Well, that's what fractional shares.
NEUT11|Is all about with any of the shares listed in the fractional shares tab.
NEUT12|You can buy less than one share.
NEUT13|You can even go as small as nought.
NEUT14|Point nought, nought.
NEUT15|One of a share, provided you invest at least 10 P. Let's give it a go.
NEUT16|By tapping on Tesla we can see the share price is 404 point North $5 and if we click on buy we can now enter our number of shares.
NEUT17|With a typical stockbroker, the minimum investment size would be one share.
NEUT18|That would mean we couldn't invest any less than 404 point nought $5.
BULL19|But with trading 212's fractional shares, we have much more flexibility.
NEUT20|Let's put in nought point nought nought.
NEUT21|5 An indication of the amount we are investing appears beneath, in this case £1.55.
NEUT22|If we now click review order, we see a summary of the order details and the final step is to click on send by order to actually put our fractional share order into the market.
NEUT23|And there are deal has been executed instantly.
NEUT24|That's another advantage of trading 212.
NEUT25|All orders are sent to the market immediately.
NEUT26|We've bought nought point nought nought 5 shares of Tesla our investment in Tesla is just one pound 55 and we paid no Commission's trading.
