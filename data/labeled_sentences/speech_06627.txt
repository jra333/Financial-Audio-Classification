NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for April 20th, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm Celina, Nicholas technical analyst at xm.com.
NEUT2|Today will look at the pound versus Japanese yen on the daily chart.
BEAR3|GBP JPY maintains a bearish outlook near the lowest levels since August 2013.
BEAR4|The pair has been falling sharply since November 2015, making lower highs and lower lows until reaching 151.63.
BEAR5|The thicker Tomoka cloud above the market will likely Cup any gains.
NEUT6|Prices tested the 50% fib, annachi retracement level and this level is at 157 and it was reached on Tuesday before prices turned back down today, this is the retracement of the down leg from 162.48 to 151.63.
BEAR7|So this was the March 29 to April 7th decline.
BEAR8|But I'm concerned the red line and the kijun Sen Blue line there, both there negatively aligned, suggesting that the recent bounce from one 5163 could be viewed as a corrective bounce before another move lower the other size below 50 in bearish territory, and this also indicates that any gains are likely to run out of momentum in the short term.
BULL9|Important support lies at 151.63.
BEAR10|The 2 1/2 year low.
BULL11|Which is broken, could see resumption of downtrend that started back in November.
BULL12|Of course, the 157 level to 50% for remains of an immediate key resistance level.
BEAR13|If we look at all three moving averages, they're falling negatively lines and this also highlights the underlying bearish market structure.
BULL14|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
