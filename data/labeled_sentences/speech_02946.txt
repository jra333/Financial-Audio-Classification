NEUT0|"""Ties in anticipation of people traveling during the summertime."
NEUT1|70% of all travel advertising is on line, and 70% of that is in search.
BEAR2|So Google is the big loser there both in March and in the June quarter, we took numbers down, but Facebook is not only exposed to travel, it's also exposed to CPG and retail and entertainment like the James Bond film being pushed off lowers advertising by 50 million, just that film being pushed from sort of near term to Dove Ember.
NEUT3|So that's about those four categories that are already showing.
NEUT4|Lower, lower advertising demand are 45% of total digital advertising in the US and 30% globally.
NEUT5|Do you think it's already in the stocks, Laura?
BEAR6|No, because I think people are underestimating that when you have a revenue downdraft, they are 70% margin dollars.
BULL7|So there's a bigger profitability hit than people are thinking and you probably saw that Microsoft, Facebook, Google are doing the kind in humanitarian thing.
BEAR8|They're going to pay all of their hourly workers who aren't coming to work anymore because they've sent everybody home.
BEAR9|So that's going to be great for the local economy, but it's going to really blow up their income statements even more than the downdraft in their revenue.
NEUT10|Laura, when you assess these stocks that you've covered for so long and know so well, do you think about the price to earnings multiple relative to the rest of the market?
NEUT11|And and do you adjust what's reasonable at moments like now when fear is spiking?
NEUT12|Traditionally these guys have had higher multiples, but when things are calm that that can be argued to be justified, 'cause their growth is high, does that go out of the window at a time like now, or does it still apply?
NEUT13|Now it sort of goes out the window right now because we don't know where the bottom is.
NEUT14|You know when we get to a bottom when this coronavirus numbers stabilize, either in the US or China or offshore, then we can look at where the bottom is and at that point we can assess what the corrections have been and start putting money back to work.
NEUT15|But right now there's so much uncertainty about the damage that coronavirus is going to do to consumer demand and to the market access like can you raise any money in the equity or debt markets right now and for how long are they?
NEUT16|Is the window closed that we have to see where those relative valuations are once it bottoms and consumer demand starts returning?
NEUT17|Is there any name that's relatively insulated from this Twitter?
NEUT18|I didn't hear you mention, for instance.
NEUT19|No, I would stay away from all ad driven stocks which are fixed.
BULL20|Cost fixed cost businesses with 70% margins.
NEUT21|I we like peloton 'cause people aren't going to a gym as coronavirus fears escalate an it's a subscription business and they have 1% churn.
NEUT22|So once you get one of these peloton bikes for any reason, even if it's to not go to the gym for a couple of months, you don't ever get off of it.
NEUT23|You so we really like peloton as a defensive play in this market?
NEUT24|But you're going to go out and buy a pellet on if you don't want to go to the gym.
NEUT25|Is that what's happening?
NEUT26|Well, I think people in our demo might be.
NEUT27|There we go.
BULL28|"Defense was down today though, but Laura thank you so much for that."""
