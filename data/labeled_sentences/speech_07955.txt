NEUT0|"""Scott, what is a price to earnings or PE ratio as it's often referred to?"
NEUT1|Yeah, one of the terms of strong around so much in investing and it's really worth trying to understand.
NEUT2|So let's break it down.
NEUT3|Price to earnings is funny enough.
NEUT4|Exactly what it says on the tin price.
NEUT5|Price per share.
NEUT6|Earnings earnings per share.
NEUT7|If I paid $20.00 for a share and I'm getting a dollar in earnings.
NEUT8|20 / 1 is a PE of 20 or 20 times earnings.
NEUT9|It's a measure of how expensive or cheap that company is relative to the number of earnings you're getting.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|If I can buy a company for 10 times earnings, if I can pay $10 for the learnings, I'd rather take that then paying $20.00 for that same dollar of earnings.
NEUT12|The cheaper I get the shares for relative to its earnings, the better deal.
NEUT13|I'm getting now.
NEUT14|That doesn't mean cheaper in price per share be cause a $20 company with a dollar of earnings is 20 times a $10.
NEUT15|Stock.
BEAR16|Feels cheaper, but there's no profit at all.
NEUT17|Well, guess what?
BEAR18|I'm getting worse dealing.
NEUT19|If I buy that.
NEUT20|, the P of 20.
NEUT21|Now it's not necessarily the bill and end on the most important thing here is this coming from Amazon.
NEUT22|Great example, right multi billion one of the top five most valuable companies in the world has almost not appear at all, and so this would be very careful in saying you should only buy low PE stocks, which is a value investing approach that can work for some people is not the only way to invest though, but it's designed to give you a look across the market and say right what are the more expensive in the cheaper stocks at least based on that one base of the earnings itself from the company so.
NEUT23|If I got two companies side by side, one side of 20, that's more expensive.
NEUT24|All things being equal, becoming AP of 10, which is more expensive, piece of five and so on.
NEUT25|OK, and what one other thing as well is we often hear trailing PE or four P. What's the difference?
NEUT26|Yeah, right, so the trailing applies not to the price.
NEUT27|The price is always today's price, but the earnings you can.
NEUT28|You can look to appear based on last year's earnings or your expectation of next year's earnings and get two very different numbers.
NEUT29|So the same company I talked about $20 a share earnings of dollar last year, trailing PE of 20, that is.
BEAR30|20 times, last year's earnings isn't going to double next year.
NEUT31|The forward.
BEAR32|Forward earnings also that P drops from a trailing PE of 20 to forward PE of 10 Chris 20 /.
NEUT33|2 In this case, when the earnings double is a PE of 10.
NEUT34|And again, that's why assuming the expensive company based on last year's numbers and all of a sudden it pretty cheap based on next year's numbers.
NEUT35|As long as those earnings come out, there's always doubt always uncertainty.
NEUT36|There will be a little bit careful forward peas because they can be dressed up based on over optimistic expectations.
NEUT37|It's always worth it with any investing looking forwards, not backwards.
NEUT38|So the low PE doesn't necessarily mean you're getting a bargain.
BEAR39|Great, in fact, some of the worst investment ever.
BEAR40|Been low peace talks, other gone broke or continue to do really, really badly.
BULL41|Some of the best companies I've had really high peers and kept on delivering even more.
NEUT42|Also, the reverse is also not necessarily true.
NEUT43|Buying every expensive PE company doesn't guarantee you a good return.
NEUT44|As always, we should buy carefully by thoughtfully the P is just one tool in the toolkit.
NEUT45|OK, so we shouldn't, I guess.
NEUT46|Rely on our entire investment thesis on the price to earnings ratio for more, use it as a guidance or a screening tool almost perfectly put.
BULL47|"Excellent, thanks God, thanks man."""
