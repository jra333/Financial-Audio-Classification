NEUT0|"""Actually, what is more, in the realm of possibility is maybe Apple taking a look at Twitter."
BULL1|No ones ever reported that they have, but Apple and Twitter are getting closer together.
NEUT2|They've integrated Twitter into the Apple iOS and it would be a cheaper way not going to be cheap.
NEUT3|It would be like probably North of $10 billion.
NEUT4|A cheaper way to sort of make a bigger bet on social, but I will say in terms of the dividend, I think that by issuing a dividend that is maybe someone.
BEAR5|Lower than what investors were expecting.
NEUT6|I think Apple is sending a signal and I was listening to the call when you guys were talking and that is they want to.
NEUT7|They want to keep some dry powder to do investments pier.
NEUT8|The Oppenheimer of the CFO was saying we need to like have the ability to pursue and maximize our investment opportunities, so I think they're saying they're saying maybe a little bit of saying that maybe we will do more in a in the future.
NEUT9|And he's also saying that this business requires a tremendous amount of capital to run and operate.
BEAR10|They spent many, many billions of dollars locking up supplier agreements with component makers, which gives them huge strategic advantage and costs an actually time to market.
BULL11|I think those costs could go higher in the future too, so they're saving some money to sort of allocate towards that as well.
NEUT12|Probably, and how far along is Apple TV?
NEUT13|I actually don't know much about that where what stage is it at home?
NEUT14|Yeah, definitely the chatters when growing about Apple TV.
BEAR15|Ever since Steve Jobs addressed it in his book and said we've cracked the code, we cracked the code.
NEUT16|No one quite actually knows what that means, but.
BULL17|Definitely sends a strong signal that he's very serious about it and they feel like they've made a lot of progress on it.
NEUT18|The Wall Street community so far is predicting that Apple TV announcement may come out at the end of this year.
NEUT19|That's the current sort of conventional wisdom.
BULL20|Let me just break in with a little more breaking news here that we just just heard that Apple stock in premarket trading is up $9 a share, so it's up modestly.
BULL21|But obviously that's a positive reaction to some of this news.
NEUT22|And you know, as you say, by keeping all that powder dry by the by, how much it costs to run the business to begin with.
NEUT23|Clearly, as you say, they're signaling listen, you know, we're not really changing.
NEUT24|Innovation is still what we need to do.
NEUT25|You gotta grow.
NEUT26|And what's the next?
NEUT27|You know, beyond Apple TV, is there another frontier that Apple can be a change agent for the way they've been in so many other areas such as music?
NEUT28|Well, that's a really good question.
NEUT29|I would.
NEUT30|I think that there's still we're still early Indians on mobile devices.
NEUT31|You know there's been a proliferation of these devices in the last, you know, four years since the iPhone came out.
NEUT32|I think there's going to be a lot more innovation in that space will see new form factors.
NEUT33|You know, Apple could invent a whole new category in that in that area TV it hasn't even come out already.
NEUT34|Saying that maybe they're going to move on from it, yeah, but you know, the living room is definitely a huge opportunity that will keep him very busy for awhile after that.
NEUT35|It's kind of hard to say.
NEUT36|I don't think there's anything obvious.
NEUT37|"After that, maybe it's in the social networking sphere."""
