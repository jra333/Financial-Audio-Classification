BEAR0|"""Even though Micron is losing the highs of the session just as the market start to fall, trade tensions, though, are certainly on hold for the moment, if not easing."
NEUT1|But as the major averages make their way back to pre tariff announcement levels, could there be some hidden gems in your markets that you're missing out on?
NEUT2|John Trainer is going to do the work for you.
NEUT3|These People's United Advisors, Chief Investment Officer, 6 billion in asset.
BULL4|Nice work John.
NEUT5|You guys have been growing, but the three stocks that you're considering net right now for your clients.
NEUT6|Talk about how you pick them and what they are.
NEUT7|These are stocks that we like.
BULL8|Fundamentally, we think they're great companies, but they haven't participated.
NEUT9|It's hard to believe that with this strong market that we've seen over the last several years, there are companies big companies that haven't participated, but these are companies with strong fundamentals.
NEUT10|Disney is one that we like quite a bit.
NEUT11|They had stock really hasn't done anything for the last three years.
NEUT12|There will certainly be some turmoil depending upon the vote with the acquisition that they'd like to make upcoming, but Disney has a phenomenal suite of content.
NEUT13|They're going to the direct to the consumer.
BEAR14|The stock has been under pressure because of cable cutting.
BULL15|We think Disney's got the right plan and you want to own Disney going forward.
NEUT16|You know it's kind of funny.
NEUT17|My 13 year old said Mom Disney just buys everybody.
NEUT18|It's threatened by and you go back to pics.
NEUT19|OK, he's thinking in those terms and Star Wars he he's right.
NEUT20|But at some point this stock has got to break out, does it not?
NEUT21|So what are we looking for?
NEUT22|What point would it trigger?
NEUT23|Well, you've got the you've got the Star Wars opening this weekend.
NEUT24|Your son, hopefully, will will go watch it.
NEUT25|Hopefully he's there.
NEUT26|Absolutely, but but what we think you know.
NEUT27|Certainly the if they can get the Fox assets, we think that would be a major trigger point.
BULL28|But even if they don't, if that doesn't happen, we think it will be a great company going forward.
NEUT29|Pepsi give me that thought of an interesting leadership story and suddenly really coming back.
NEUT30|It's got the salty.
NEUT31|It's got.
NEUT32|The sweet.
NEUT33|Yep, Pepsi is A is a favorite of mine.
NEUT34|It was actually the first research report I ever wrote early in the early days of Mycareer and I've followed Pepsi for 35 years.
BULL35|It's a great company.
NEUT36|You focus on the beverages, but Pepsi also has the snack business Frito-lay as we move through this economic recovery and the economy is long in the tooth and everybody reads about the next recession coming.
NEUT37|You want to have those high quality companies in your portfolio to insulate you?
BULL38|We think Pepsi is going to be a great one going forward.
NEUT39|Listen to John trainer.
NEUT40|He's he's seen it all.
