NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for November 24th, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm ready by John, currency analyst at xm.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at the Australian dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR3|Aut USD has fallen over 5% in the two weeks after the US election crossing below the 50 and 200 day moving average is in the process.
BULL4|The pair has retraced 74% of its May to November update from Zero Point 7144.
BEAR5|Two Zero point 7777, before rebounding slightly to around 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.
BEAR6|Prices are currently finding resistance at the 61.8 bonacci level around Zero Point 7385.
BEAR7|As the near term bias remains strongly bearish, as indicated by the deepening decline of the mckeddie in negative ground.
BULL8|However, the stochastic suggests there is some upward momentum following an extended span in oversold territory, and this could prove this could prevent prices from further steep falls should aut USD resume it slide.
BULL9|It will likely find support at Monday's five month Low Zero Point 7310.
NEUT10|Below that, the 78.6% humidity level comes into focus at Zero point 7072.
NEUT11|Eighty.
BEAR12|On the upside, the Zero Point 74 level could prove another stumbling block soon after overcoming resistance at 61.8 Fibonacci level at Zero Point 7385.
BULL13|Overcoming the zero point 74 level should clear the path towards the 50% Fibonacci level at Zero point 7460.
BULL14|However, stronger push above the 0.75 level is needed to shift the count bearish buys two more neutral one.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
