NEUT0|"""The miracle of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and the others has to also be the terminal value out X number of years."
NEUT1|This is really important, folks.
NEUT2|What's the time duration?
NEUT3|Tom Forte of that terminal value calculation?
NEUT4|I don't think it's a textbook amount.
NEUT5|Perhaps they're so dominant that the terminal value is out, what, 10 or 15 years?
NEUT6|So great Question Time is always were modeling 10 years out in part of the reason we think stocks in general have done so well is we're in the middle of a very, very low interest rate environment, so our discount rate.
BEAR7|I don't want to historic lows, but it's a very low number.
NEUT8|So 10 years from now.
BULL9|The question is, can Amazon still grow as a company at a 15% David and right now the answer looks to be yeah.
NEUT10|OK, but Tom this is critical and I don't mean to interrupt, but this is so incredible critical for the Bloomberg surveillance audience.
NEUT11|First of all, you're out ten years in at seven years.
NEUT12|Fine, how does a sovereign wealth fund?
NEUT13|How does big money?
NEUT14|How does Warren Buffett deal with that?
NEUT15|Should Warren Buffett be acquiring Amazon right now with his terminal value of 10 or 15 or 20 years?
NEUT16|Yes, the answer is even.
NEUT17|Warren Buffett should be buying shares of Amazon if he has a 10 year outlook as we're employing right now, 'cause I think again, if you think about what we're going through, we're experiencing right now and how this is just accelerating the transition to digital.
NEUT18|You think about ecommerce historically as a high single digit, low double digit, percentage of total retail sales?
NEUT19|Well, what if that moves to 20% not overnight, but in short order.
NEUT20|So I do think that over a 10 year.
NEUT21|The law of large numbers definitely sets in for.
BULL22|Amazon from Microsoft and others, meaning that as you're growing on a bigger sales base, your growth moderates over time.
BULL23|"But I do think that this transition to digital caused by COVID-19 is real and sustainable and significant."""
