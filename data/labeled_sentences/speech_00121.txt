BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to talk about an energy company that I'm super excited about.
NEUT2|The company is called Orbital Energy Group ticker symbol to e.g we're talking a bit about the company and also looking at the price action that we saw today and then at the end of the video will give my price predictions.
NEUT3|So stick around.

BEAR6|So looking at OMG on the day, the stock file, the rest of the market throughout the day, dipping all the way down to a low of $3.60 on the day and reaching a high of $5.43 and the stock is currently sitting at $5.23 in the after hours.
BULL7|So the stock bounce back.
BULL8|Strong effort in that low of the day at $3.60.
NEUT9|And from that point of $3.60 to a high of $5.43 today that represent about a 50% jump from that point, here's a quick overview of what the company does.
BULL10|Orbital Energy Group ticker symbol OG is creating diversified energy services through acquisition and development of innovative companies.
NEUT11|The different groups owned by the business, our Orbital Gas Systems, Orbital Power Systems, and Orbital Solar Systems.
NEUT12|So now we take a quick glance at each of these different aspects of the group or will gas systems.
BULL13|A 30 year leader in innovative gas solutions.
NEUT14|Serving the energy, power, and processing markets through design, installation and commissioning of industrial sampling, the next area is orbital power systems, which provides engineering, construction, maintenance and emergency response solutions to the power and utilities market and then the last sector is orbital solar, which provides engineering and construction expertise to the renewable energy industry.
BEAR15|So the stock also recently hit its high for the year when it reached $11.20 on January 27th before dropping back down and ultimately following this downtrend that many stocks have been following.
NEUT16|Now as far as price, target for the stock, we actually have three analysts ratings with these analysts offering a low price forecast of $12.00 and a high of $16.50, giving us a medium price target of $15 for the stock, which leaves a lot of room left to grow.
NEUT17|Now what I really like about this company outside of them being in the renewable energy sector which is going to be a huge sector this year coming up and along with the next couple of years is how diversified they are into that area.
NEUT18|So I think that diversified very well inside the clean energy sector.
NEUT19|So this is a stock.
NEUT20|I definitely think you should take a look into if you haven't.
BEAR21|Especially now with a lot of these stocks being a sale price due to the current market correction.
NEUT22|I also wanted to talk about this stock because I didn't see it being discussed that much on YouTube.
BULL23|And I think it's a solid company and I do see this.
NEUT24|Personally, my price prediction for the end of the year is at least $20.00 if not higher.
BULL25|As far As for next week, I'm looking for us to start recovering a little bit more, and I think the stock could be up back up to that $7.00 range pretty quickly.
NEUT26|But what do you guys think about OMG?
NEUT27|Did you guys buy the dip today?
NEUT28|"Also let me know your price predictions down below and remember this video isn't financial advice is just for entertainment purposes only."""
