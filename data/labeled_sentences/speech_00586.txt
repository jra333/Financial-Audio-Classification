NEUT0|"""Everyone Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and it's a nice video."
NEUT1|We're going to take a look at a short trade in one of the toymakers, but before we get to that I want to just take a quick look at the S&P 500 futures.
NEUT2|We're going to take a look here and you can see we've talked about in the stock market outlook video that we put out Saturday, but we have this potential for a head and shoulders reversal and.
BULL3|We were up nicely today and ended up selling off late in the day.
NEUT4|But you could see where that sell off really brought us to was right to this trend line here that we're looking at zero for right now.
NEUT5|You know, we're really looking at more of a consolidation pattern.
NEUT6|Anything else, it really has to determine which way it wants to break.
NEUT7|You can see we're putting in almost a symmetrical triangle here, where we're basically bouncing between this downtrend line and this uptrend line.
BEAR8|OK, today we touched both of those lines so it really could break either way here and thinking about that.
NEUT9|I wanted to give you guys a short trade.
NEUT10|I've been giving you long trades all last week, so one trade that I came across today was in Mattel.
NEUT11|Am Mattel basically a set up for a short trade is the exact opposite of what it would be for a long trade, so you could see here on the weekly chart.
BULL12|We're looking at a nice downtrend line.
BULL13|Alright, on the weekly and then we were coming in an consolidating.
NEUT14|Here.
BEAR15|OK, so it moved away from that weekly.
BEAR16|Trendline consolidated sideways for about two months and now looks like it's breaking down lower.
NEUT17|So if you zoom in here on the daily little bit of a better picture.
NEUT18|You can see this downtrend line in place.
BULL19|And the consolidation that it had.
NEUT20|From October onward.
NEUT21|OK, you could see them today.
BEAR22|What's happening is now we're breaking down below the support of that consolidation.
NEUT23|So just as if it was a long play, we'd be looking for a break out to the upside above above resistance on a short play.
BEAR24|We're looking at a breakdown below support.
NEUT25|Alright, so you can enter this trade.
NEUT26|Just be careful.
BULL27|Earnings are coming up on the end of the month.
NEUT28|Looks like the 30th.
NEUT29|Other than that, just enter the trade user risk management.
NEUT30|Techniques and exit the trade when you feel necessary, but I think it's a good set up moving forward so other than that you know premium members please get over to the strategy session where we're going to be adding two more positions to the portfolio and going over some of our existing positions.
NEUT31|"Alright, take care guys see you tomorrow."""
