NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see from the early September.
BEAR2|Till now we nearly got a very flat pattern for the Apple stock, especially for the recent weeks.
BEAR3|We have the volume comparably very low so we can see even though we got three continuous.
BEAR4|Advance, but the volume decreased significantly, so it's not a good sign for Apple.
NEUT5|It means there's no enough buying power even though we have approached the.
NEUT6|Top range of the EMS.
BEAR7|We're stuck in the trading range, so no momentum actually.
NEUT8|So in my opinion.
NEUT9|There is no institution accumulation at this moment and we can see it has stucked in this trading average.
BEAR10|For several months, so it's not a good sign for a formal leader.
BULL11|As we can see from the chart, so actually we are stucked.
NEUT12|Between.
NEUT13|Sorry between.
NEUT14|Between this trading range so.
BEAR15|With the decrease the volume, there's no institution interest.
NEUT16|So as we can see from this pattern, I don't see Apple is a buy here.
NEUT17|And even we got it as a flight pattern.
NEUT18|It's very likely for somebody.
NEUT19|To make a move from here because the volume is very shy.
BULL20|"So I don't think it's a bad point from here, thank you."""
