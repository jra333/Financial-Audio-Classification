NEUT0|"""Here we go."
BULL1|We had a wonderful trade on Netflix off the intraday bottoms.
NEUT2|I want to show in the video of where it broke down right here, but more importantly is how the MMT Brian plane got half of that by bar right there called that trade out, zip that up.
NEUT3|Then we have Peter Brady who shorted half below that bar right now and he's still in the trade.
BEAR4|He also knows that he's got a break below $0.71 and that is closing below here.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at half are there.
NEUT6|That reversal, so that was a nice break out with a good reversal short, so Brian playing got the long side of that call there.
NEUT7|An Peter Brady is short right here and it's working below half the bars now happen.
NEUT8|This bar we need another continuation bar to walk down to this teeny line here and now on that trend reversal.
NEUT9|And that's how the MMT's make their paychecks because they're getting that nine minute movement.
NEUT10|So they're getting paid 1X here.
NEUT11|2X here and the thing about it is is having the pricing control system allows them.
BEAR12|Data Peter Brady breaks below 15 here.
BEAR13|This is going to go lower.
NEUT14|So it has to break below 15 there and it appears that everything is working in the gauge is that the EMTs are prompted and commanded to using the gauges are right here naturally and there's an info panel I don't know if the info panel shows up in the video, it should, but it's OK but doesn't take a free five day trial.
NEUT15|You can see what the ammenties use.
NEUT16|Here's the whole broader chart today that was a nice short.
NEUT17|I'm hearing that Peter Brady discovered she had one short another short right there.
NEUT18|You have that nice.
NEUT19|"Then you have this nice burn and that other Shorten will conclude the Inter day long and short trade with the ** empties and the timestamp is 10:44 AM Pacific Standard Time."""
