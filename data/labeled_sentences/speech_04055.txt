NEUT0|"""What's up, investor maniacs nightrider here."
NEUT1|Gotta be a little quiet.
NEUT2|It's about 5:00 in the morning.
BEAR3|Still a bunch of people sleeping.
BULL4|Anyways, we've got Amazon and they announced that they will be opening their largest office yet.
NEUT5|And it's an India.
NEUT6|This massive space sprawls across a nine and a half acres and can manage 15,000 employees.
BEAR7|This is a serious signal that Amazon has no intentions of quitting on India where it has had some problems.
BULL8|India has a rapidly growing e-commerce market and expanding economy.
BEAR9|But Amazon hasn't received its fair share of that growth, so it's doubling down.
NEUT10|This isn't the only development in India for Amazon.
NEUT11|Amazon has also recently been in talks to buy Reliance Retail and Future retail.
BULL12|Two of India's largest retailers, Amazon has also been in talks of buying the bleeding Uber eats India.
BULL13|India was previously considered to be an important part of Amazon's international growth strategy as India has the fastest growing economy of any major country.
BEAR14|Unfortunately, however, earlier this year the Indian government placed heavy restrictions on foreign companies involved in E Commerce.
BULL15|Despite increased restrictions, Amazon is still continuing to push forward while Amazon is King in North America.
BULL16|With a massive dominance and still rapidly growing top line, around 20%.
BULL17|Pretty crazy for a company that size international numbers don't look nearly as hot despite having a much smaller presence and therefore should have quicker growth.
BULL18|International sales are only up about 12% year over year.
NEUT19|So, is Amazon continuing to push International a good thing or a bad thing?
NEUT20|It's somewhat comes down to investor preference.
NEUT21|If you wanted something conservative, you'd buy Walmart or Apple.
NEUT22|If you're buying Amazon, you're doing it because you want some growth and you should be therefore willing to take on additional risk.
NEUT23|I like it, that's it for this video.
BULL24|"If you liked it, I'd appreciate a thumbs up and make sure you're subscribed to invest the Mania brother."""
