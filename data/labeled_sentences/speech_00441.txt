NEUT0|"""Set Laura Martin, who has a hold rating on SNAP, but what what drove this intra day turn around massive intra day turn around?"
BULL1|Yeah so I think they really groos revenue very strongly in the fourth quarter up 62% and they grew EPS of 55% the year over year.
BULL2|Subscriber ads were very strong at 22% but there are clues so the average revenue for each of those went up 50% faster and rose 33%.
BULL3|So I think very strong fundamental earnings momentum coming out of four Q.
BEAR4|The stock originally was down yesterday because Evans said that they had a couple week advertising weeks in January and he was worried about I DFA, which is an Apple privacy setting that comes into effect later in the quarter.
BEAR5|But I think that that kind of negativity affects so many stocks that aren't being hurt by this, which is why you've seen Snap, turn and rally later today and Laura, we're going to send it to Mark Warner about Section 230 in just a few minutes time are snap as exposed to potential.
NEUT6|More regulation in that area or others as the likes of Facebook or not.
NEUT7|Definitely not, because snap only you have to actually by hand.
NEUT8|Add one person at a time so it's very much your best friends, which is why they only have 260 million users every single day versus Facebook's at 2.2 billion.
NEUT9|And so that's all about only your close friends.
NEUT10|So basically the privacy settings are perfect for the regulators on SNAP.
NEUT11|Well, Laura wanted to ask you about some of your very hot stock picks that you've had over the last few months.
BULL12|Fubo TV trade desk and those have been really, really strong calls.
NEUT13|Stocks have gone straight up, Mag Night was the one you gave us last time or all of these swept up.
NEUT14|Do you think in the in the retail trading frenzy and the unusual activity we've seen?
NEUT15|Well, let's talk about trade desk magnet Infobot, which were the ones we were talking about last time I was here.
BULL16|Little volatility in those, but they have nicely since the last time I was on as as promised an I would say this streaming and connected TV growth very strong coming out of the fourth quarter an I think next year is going to be probably 40% growth in Connected TV as linear TV advertisers are looking to follow the audience to streaming 'cause the streaming audience almost doubled during covid.
NEUT17|So now advertisers are really looking to reach those people in those.
NEUT18|Hours of viewing, and so I think all these connected TV so fubo an trade desk, an magnet all participate in connected TV advertising growth.
NEUT19|Let's give into pellets on as well have obviously reported.
NEUT20|Last night.
BEAR21|Clearly there's a lot of delivery delay.
NEUT22|Some of that on them, some of it's not.
NEUT23|Do you think they've learned from those errors if they were errors in the first place?
NEUT24|Yeah, I mean, I think that's the best point.
BEAR25|I mean, they're disrupting an entire industry and they've never run a public company before, and I think they made a mistake, which is that at a time when they couldn't meet bike demand, they introduced a second bike, created chaos, created long service times an elongated their deliveries.
NEUT26|So having learned from that, now they're supposed to be.
NEUT27|They announced two months ago they were going to introduce a lower priced red, so it looked like they were going to make the same mistake again.
NEUT28|But no, they use the UK.
NEUT29|Is there test market?
NEUT30|Band is through the roof, so now they're not going to launch the US as fast.
BULL31|They're going to use the US inventory, and they're going to meet demand in Canada in the UK, which is higher than expected, and they're going to push off the launch in America, which is great.
NEUT32|'cause that forces Americans to buy $4500 treads instead of $2500 trends.
NEUT33|So all good from a shareholder point of view.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
