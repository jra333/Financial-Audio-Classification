NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and it looks to me like we are trying to break out here and make a move towards 3200 in the Heights."
BULL1|For what it's worth, the NASDAQ 100 actually touched the all time high today so.
NEUT2|It's probably only a matter of time.
NEUT3|Fundamentals don't matter, they've completely.
NEUT4|Thrown everything out the window.
BULL5|So with that being the case, I think what we're going to have to wait on, you know if you're short term momentum Trader, then obviously the buying opportunity only thing you can take 3000 should offer support the 200 day MA, a breakout longer term with fundamentals not matching and they're nowhere near matching up to what we're seeing.
NEUT6|Eventually this ends in tears because you know, look at.
NEUT7|This was a pretty sharp run and then it just collapsed.
BEAR8|Even a natural pullback could have us going back to 2800.
BEAR9|"The problem is is it just hasn't come yet and the longer we wait, the more deep the correction could be in the short term though, you gotta chase the FOMO if you're going to trade it at all."""
