NEUT1|We're going to look at U.S. dollar with the Canadian dollar, then delete time frame.
NEUT2|So make it to the child.
NEUT3|Now their prices trading not far from the 20th floor it a Smas which are moving horizontally over the last sessions.
BEAR4|Video after buyer is looking good, too bearish as their size cluttering naturally above the 50 level.
BEAR5|While this to Hassocks are pointing South and the percentage K and percentage, the lines are ready for a bearish cross if the pair make another move lower, it's likely to meet support other three eight point 2% people of the applicant from one point 2951 point 4668 at one point 4510 and Jubilo.
BULL6|A break below this level could open the way for one point 3850 and a 50% people out on predatory 808.
BEAR7|If Bridget will shift their focus to the downside and Packers would slip to the one point 3665 and 61.8% people, four point 3610.
NEUT8|On the other hand, the Smas are the nearest resistance is around one point 4080 that hold held steeper increases a potentially more important resistance though is the 1.41.
NEUT9|70 before meeting the 23.6% people of one point, 4260 even higher, the market could made your point 4350 barrier register on March 31st.
NEUT10|In the bigger picture.
BULL11|Now undercut will need to make a sustained climb above the more than four year high of one point 4668 in order for the outlook to become called basically bullish.
BEAR12|And a plunge under the 61.8% of people or one point 3610 quarter.
BEAR13|The sentiment too negative.
