NEUT0|"""February 3rd is in the books here on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
BEAR2|It's been a day dominated.
BULL3|As you might expect by the nonfarm payrolls reports, this was the most important number from the reports, average hourly earnings had been rising quite well, pegged back somewhat this month.
BEAR4|Bad news for Main Street.
BULL5|Good news for Wall Street because it means less pressure on inflation, less pressure to raise rates.
BEAR6|As you can see, the two year bond yields dropped very sharply after we got the report, but it did rebound later after we heard from the Chairman of the San Francisco Fed.
BULL7|Seems he thought it might be a good idea to raise rates next month.
BEAR8|Now there is another blot on the political landscape and it's in France.
BEAR9|If we take a look at how yields of French bonds are rising compared to German yields, you can see that markets are getting very worried by the political pressures there ahead of the election later this year.
BULL10|Meanwhile, the Dow here is back through 20,000.
NEUT11|The biggest winner among their constituents since the election is Goldman Sachs the biggest loser?
NEUT12|"Is Walmart Joe 6 pack must be delighted and that's the New York Minute."""
