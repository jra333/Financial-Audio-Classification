NEUT0|"""Very simply, how much further does the dollar have to fall?"
NEUT1|What's your view on that?
BEAR2|I think it's quite a bit to fall in the coming months.
BULL3|Basically we've got a huge boost for the euro in the form of the EU agreement.
BEAR4|This is really, really solid and this is where we've continued to see the dollar weakened.
NEUT5|After that agreement went through.
BULL6|But look US is lost, his tail went from interest, rates were going to get that even reinforced this week as the Federal Reserve Board lose out moves away from Stabalization back to accommodation.
BULL7|Shortage of U.S. dollars is gone.
NEUT8|And you know what's really holding the dollar in place right now is equity markets.
BEAR9|We're seeing that exceptionalism fade right now so as opposed to a gradual decline, we might even see a freefall of the US equity markets continue to decline precipitously.
BULL10|So that is despite potentially getting another stimulus package being secured later on this ban, and despite the fact that we are, you know, cautiously starting to see the signs of a stabilization when it comes to virus cases.
NEUT11|This is the one thing why I think there's the fares are or I should say the Bulls are being a little bit reticent to fall into that bear trap right now.
NEUT12|There's a lot of noise going on in the background with the US China trade.
BEAR13|Tensions continue to simmer.
NEUT14|We've also got the fact that stocks were.
BEAR15|It did make, did make runs higher on good numbers, and that's a warning sign.
BEAR16|And obviously behind the covert narrative, there's still that lingering economic deep down.
BULL17|It's almost we're going to almost moved to what I believe is like a growth divergent, straight.
NEUT18|Those economies that emerged from.
BULL19|Kovit quicker are going to do better there for the currency will feel right now the US is lagging in that.
NEUT20|But listen never count out the power of the US consumer and that's one thing we have to keep always threaten focus when we're shorting the dollar.
NEUT21|Yeah, of course.
BEAR22|Dollar weakness has also helped some commodities, especially the gold and other precious metals really rallying.
NEUT23|And that's not only because of the weak dollar, of course is a macro environment.
NEUT24|This GTV chart on the Bloomberg Steven also showing the relative performance of precious metals when it comes to the broad commodity markets as a percentage of balance sheets as a percentage of GDP continues to rise, those balance sheets and central bank easing.
BULL25|We have seen the Gold futures pricing.
NEUT26|Out of record right now, how much further up can it go?
BEAR27|It's interesting, you know we're looking at investors right now, with the dollar falling over the last couple of weeks quite quickly.
BEAR28|They're out looking for alternative assets to hedge that falling dollar.
NEUT29|Obviously gold is being in the highlight.
NEUT30|I think gold is a little bit more to go here.
NEUT31|I don't think you can give up right now.
BEAR32|Clearly I think it's got breached the the 1920 level, which is really the big all time high here.
NEUT33|But I think what it's getting triggered by.
NEUT34|Mostly it's the beneficiarii not only of safe haven demand.
BEAR35|But it's also the beneficiary of falling yields, and this is really the key signpost.
BEAR36|So if you factor in another 2% decline in the US dollar break.
BULL37|Broad trade weighted averages perhaps another 35% rise in 10 year inflation break evens up and move it to 185 and perhaps nominal.
BEAR38|Yeah, 10 year Treasury yields falling.
NEUT39|And let's say another 30 basis points to sort of around that .25 level.
NEUT40|I think that'll put us up to 2005 for me.
NEUT41|It's very much tide in the hip to what?
BULL42|Bond yields are doing so.
NEUT43|The question is rather can goal keep on rolling?
NEUT44|Is really one of which can real yields keep on falling.
NEUT45|"So I think we have to be really cognizant of how the real yield markets are or are playing out right now."""
