NEUT0|"""OK Matt, it is about that time."
NEUT1|This week we're going to wrap things up with our one to watch.
NEUT2|What is the stock that you'll be watching this week?
NEUT3|It's not really a financial sector stock.
NEUT4|I'm looking at Amazon Omaha.
NEUT5|We we talked about them quite a bit.
BEAR6|They're down roughly 25% from the highs and I think I think that their new payment system is going to have some traction.
BEAR7|Like I said, I personally think they're going to that PayPal and the others are going to lose a little bit of their growth trajectory because Amazon has a big existing customer base for this.
NEUT8|To this to really play well with not just because of that.
BULL9|I think Amazon is a good valued.
BULL10|I thought Amazon was a pretty decent value at about $2000 a share, so I really think it's a good value now and there's talk of them.
NEUT11|You know, offering some kind of Co branded checking account product.
NEUT12|So maybe there will be a financial sector stock after all.
NEUT13|But I love Amazon this week.
NEUT14|Yeah, I put nothing past him.
BULL15|That's a good one.
NEUT16|I'm going to go with Tiffany this week.
NEUT17|Ticker is TIF and I know this may seem a little bit of an odd pick because it's not directly a financial.
NEUT18|But I've covered Tiffany for a number of years now, and what I have found is that Tiffany is a very good indicator of how the economy is doing and how the market thinks the economy is going to be doing here in the coming quarters and more.
NEUT19|Of course, at a point right now you know what we're in right now.
NEUT20|Matt is what I like to call the Larry David economy.
BULL21|It's everything is pretty pretty, pretty good, and I hope that that will continue, but I think on Wednesday, when Tiffany's earnings come out, we'll get a better idea management recently had.
BULL22|Raised guidance last year or last quarter, which was impressive.
NEUT23|I thought they're going to be investing a lot in their New York flagship store here in the coming year, and that really does matter for a company like Tiffany.
NEUT24|That depends on that physical presence in what they do, that, I think, is just so phenomenal they really protect that brand so well because it is a luxury brand.
NEUT25|They don't resort to fire sales, and you're not going to find big Cyber Monday.
NEUT26|Half off deals with Tiffany, they protect that brand.
NEUT27|And again, do a very good job so that when times are good like they are right now, the stock feels and it looks like it's feeling it right now when times get a little tough.
BULL28|Certainly the stock feels it again.
NEUT29|And honestly I think that's where investors need to consider potentially investing in a business like this is when is when the times get a little bit tougher and I'm sure on Wednesday will get a better idea of what management sees coming around here for the next next full year.
NEUT30|"Certainly the holiday quarter guidance just a lot of things you can glean from this luxury retailer and Tiffany, so we'll keep an eye on it."""
