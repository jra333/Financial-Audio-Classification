NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take for the Apple stock we can see here."
NEUT1|It has formed the right kind of this red candle stuck between these two year my lines and there's no break out from here.
BEAR2|And we can see from the warm volume is very low, especially in the past three days there's.
BEAR3|Decreased volume, so it's not a good sign for Apple.
NEUT4|The volume is too short, but it's very likely for it to.
NEUT5|Make a study base here.
NEUT6|That means the consolidation.
BULL7|If that's the case, then there still possibility for it to go higher.
BEAR8|But if the volume continue to decrease the price go down.
NEUT9|That will be by the side.
BULL10|"Thank you."""
