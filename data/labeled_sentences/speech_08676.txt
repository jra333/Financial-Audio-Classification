NEUT0|"""How's gonna release to ensure he ran to his voting look at ZZOM's America now before we get into it?"
NEUT1|I do want you guys know that way back.
NEUT2|Last year 12 Dash 31 just before the shutdown of the market, would you let you know at $0.24 so possibly a whole $0.11 if you guys took the call right when we said about an sold right there at the high today at $0.35.
NEUT3|So make sure guide if you want to join it.
NEUT4|Click the link in the description.
NEUT5|It's one $3 a month.
BEAR6|OK, so going to make this deal down line right there at $35.
BULL7|Again, great day.
NEUT8|We could even break it right here as the market is about to close just just over 3 minutes now for support.
BULL9|We do have some support at $0.29 as well as view app.
BULL10|Review, view Apple obviously move up as the price does.
BULL11|But it was a nice terrace it up.
NEUT12|I actually I would say it was a little bit of a pump but not saying the public dump.
NEUT13|You know 'cause?
BULL14|Obviously it was good stair step up here.
NEUT15|And then once we broke that 29 and it came back down to it.
NEUT16|Lot of investors saw that and push the way back up.
NEUT17|We were just talking about it in the page on to where this could go on the private Discord picture.
NEUT18|You know we're calling $0.50 out here, but at the same time we don't want it to go back down to $0.15, for example.
NEUT19|But we did break out of that.
NEUT20|2720 in the now 29 and then if we can break out of the 35 again because you know it was a double top right there, yeah, we could see $0.50.
NEUT21|But you know, I wouldn't buy it.
NEUT22|And you know, hold it.
NEUT23|Hope as we like to call it so I wouldn't hold and hope.
NEUT24|But if you guys are up, I'd take your profits as I always say, but that $0.50 price level is not looking that bad.
NEUT25|So go ahead and make it the green data line to represent the ultimate price target of 0M.
NEUT26|Now if I take you out to the three year.
BEAR27|I don't think there was a split so 298, but obviously is going to have to break above a dollar and that won't be an easy thing to do just because it's been under a dollar while ever since.
NEUT28|Three dash 4.
NEUT29|Of.
NEUT30|Of 2020 so.
NEUT31|Take a look at the news now only knew today was only got points.
NEUT32|Robert Cohen CEO as company nears, commercialization of true forma.
NEUT33|So obviously once they get to formally know out in the markets you know on the shelves obviously.
NEUT34|Yeah this company could be a dollar.
NEUT35|That's twelve there, seven there.
NEUT36|So in this again, I don't know when their release date will be, but obviously it will be a huge day to keep it on your watch list.
NEUT37|But yeah, the data level doesn't look that bad, will just have to break some break resistance and then use their resistance and turn it into support as we as we basically preach out here in this tune Trader community.
NEUT38|OK so go on calls like that.
NEUT39|At 24 cents.
NEUT40|Definitely join the Patreon down below.
NEUT41|Only three $3 a month.
BULL42|Like I said, good support at 25.
NEUT43|Love to see it hold and I really wouldn't like really would like to see I go to $0.50 if not this week then next week and then when they launched their two formula.
NEUT44|"Alright guys, thanks for watching the OMC the next one and leave your questions come to pin it down below normal alright?"""
