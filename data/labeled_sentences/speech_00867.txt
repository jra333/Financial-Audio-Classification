BEAR0|"""Since normally we'd go back and say I don't know Byron, you missed this or you miss that I don't even want to talk about 2020."
NEUT1|I don't it, just it was so Black Swan ish and out of the realm of anything that was predicted that let's just let's just forget about it and do this years and I know you do this.
NEUT2|I know that Joe's Idol sidled up to you and now he's got it.
NEUT3|Looks like his influences here 'cause some of these predictions this year kind.
NEUT4|They're not as surprising as some that you've made in the past.
NEUT5|I a lot of these, I think.
NEUT6|Are almost you know, and you know how you like to surprise us?
NEUT7|They're kind of what I would think might might happen.
BEAR8|Well, that's that's encouraging to hear, but I don't know that too many people think the market could be down to close to 20% in the first half and still close at 4500.
NEUT9|I think that's that would be pretty much of a surprise.
NEUT10|Most people don't think the 10 year Treasury is going to go to a 2% yield.
NEUT11|No.
NEUT12|Most people don't believe that both the Fed and the Treasury will embrace monetary modern monetary theory like we already have.
NEUT13|Yeah, they had on a de facto basis they have.
NEUT14|So you know, I think there's some legitimate surprises there, but you're right.
NEUT15|About seven of them are in the direction of the consensus, just more extreme.
NEUT16|But there are three that are really surprises that China surprise.
BULL17|Having a favorable relationship with China.
NEUT18|That's certainly one.
NEUT19|That's a loaded one.
NEUT20|Wait, wait, that's a loaded one with.
NEUT21|Vice president with President Biden, of course he's going to.
BULL22|I mean, China's done a lot for the Bidens.
NEUT23|Come on, Byron, of course he's gonna work, you know, if he achieved that, that would be a surprise.
NEUT24|No, I know the Justice Department pulling back on trying to break up.
NEUT25|Google and Facebook.
NEUT26|That would be a big surprise and the dollar being strong rather than weak would be a big surprise, true.
NEUT27|So those are three clear surprises and the others are more extreme, so I'm pretty comfortable that they're not in the that for one reason or another.
NEUT28|They're not in the consensus.
BULL29|The dollar see OK so you got that the US economy and the financial markets are going to become very attractive again.
NEUT30|Post vaccine so that would be a strong economy would bolster the dollar obviously, but but one of the things that we worry about is that a lot of the markets across the board reflect.
NEUT31|The notion that we will be coming back and it's already in a lot of the markets, right?
BULL32|That's why that's why we're going to have a correction in the first half, and we're probably beginning it now.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
