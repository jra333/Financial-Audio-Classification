BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone to my channel."
BULL1|Mr Moved back with you and Ripple has had an amazing day today.
BULL2|Up over 35 about 35% as I'm recording this video and now it's coming close to where Cardano is.
NEUT3|So $38 billion in market cap and I think it's the crust it as now as I'm recording this video so.
BULL4|It might work up towards the 4th spot to even third spot.
BEAR5|You never know if this lawsuit can get behind of SRP and now is at a two month high.
BULL6|Finally is getting some upward movement after the US court granted XRP holders emotion to intervene in the lawsuit.
NEUT7|That means now, if you're a token Holder, if you were a token Holder, you can actually intervene.
NEUT8|And what's going on right now and you will have a couple of weeks to file your papers and put in what you think of what's going on and the timeline.
NEUT9|Everything.
NEUT10|I'll leave a link to this article down below because it goes into much more detail about it, but today I really want to speak about the price because if we look at it, if we zoom out, this is exactly where we consolidate it back in May of 2018, we consolidated right here for a like a couple months before going down.
BULL11|So I believe that we can go up towards it around the $1.00 mark.
NEUT12|Before consolidating.
NEUT13|We might not even hit the $1.00 before it consolidates and then shoots up again.
NEUT14|'cause on this channel we speak a lot about how things cannot move up in a straight line like Hadera.
NEUT15|Hashgraph for example, is one of our favorite to on this channel and it is going down right now so it is going through a consolidation period.
NEUT16|Stuff cannot go up in a straight line.
BULL17|Singularity your net right now is going up.
BULL18|But soon I believe it will consolidate just like XRP&XRPI believe is no different right now that RSI is showing that it's over, but but sometimes that's a bullish signal.
BULL19|So if we can stay up here for a while, we can see it go up to the $1.00 mark around there and then again it will come back down eventually.
NEUT20|And once it does, that's when you'll see the consolidation.
NEUT21|So this RSI is proof that stuff does not go up in a straight line.
NEUT22|What do you think about this great news for SRP?
NEUT23|What is your price targets for SRP in this bull run?
NEUT24|How high do you think it can go?
NEUT25|Do you think will break his all time high?
NEUT26|Are you gonna hold all the way up or are you going to sell before it even gets there?
NEUT27|What are you gonna do with this token?
