NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of ADP is range between $4.41 per share and $68.96 per share."
NEUT1|How were these values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $4.41 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $4.41 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $68.96 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings, a price of $68.96 per share represents the fractional payment that we don't have to pay.
NEUT4|For the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|Now this is a conservative way to value the company using its future or future earnings, and it only slightly different from the results you get by calculating the price to earnings ratio.
NEUT6|So what's ATP trading at today?
NEUT7|Currently Atps trading at a price of $169.89 which is massively over this high end that we've calculated, so the next reasonable conclusion.
NEUT8|Well, it's to assume that the stock is currently overpriced.
NEUT9|The next step is we need to find an alternative that holds a similar risk and yields a similar return, all while maintaining our safety of principle in an ample margin of safety.
NEUT10|Now, if you're a defensive investor like myself, a low cost index fund satisfies the information investment vehicle requirements.
NEUT11|Specifically, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is the fund that you'd want to invest in, and I recommend you do think in this binary sense in terms of either investing in company A or some other alternative.
NEUT12|This is a proven alternative and I really like this fund, in particular because Warren Buffett used it to beat out the hedge fund guys in a bet that he made in 2008 and subsequently one in 2018, so.
NEUT13|We would want to invest in this in this Vanguard 500 index fund.
BEAR14|Until this price for ADP falls beneath the high end of our intrinsic value range calculations.
NEUT15|So we're talking $68.95 or below.
NEUT16|Granted, this number will change as as knew you know, we get new earnings reports.
NEUT17|You 10 cases come in, what will adjust the calculation accordingly, but that's that's what we'll do until ATP starts trading at a reasonable price.
