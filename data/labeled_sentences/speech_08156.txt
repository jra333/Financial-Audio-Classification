NEUT0|"""Like boss here folks, and everybody talking investing, we're going to be looking at how the average investor can take advantage and beat Wall Street."
NEUT1|So a lot of variables put the beginning investor at a disadvantage, but there's one way investors can easily invest on the cheap with little effort.
BULL2|Beat the pros in avoid the common pitfalls facing beginners or people with a smaller amount of money to invest in the market.
NEUT3|And what is this?
NEUT4|While it's direct stock purchase plans, I'm going to get into those later, but first let me explain four reasons why these are so great.
NEUT5|So number one most investors aren't able to regularly invest.
BEAR6|Overtime due to high transaction costs and account minimum requirements.
NEUT7|So in order to qualify for the low transaction costs that many people on Wall Street with those higher amount of money to invest have investors have to have a lot of money and therefore can't meet the minimum balance requirement needed to get those low transaction costs.
BEAR8|That's prevents them from investing regularly overtime and leave them at a disadvantage to the pros.
NEUT9|Direct stock purchase plans often only charge a dollar or less for monthly investments.
NEUT10|So if you have less than $10,000, you'll be hard pressed to find a deal like that.
NEUT11|Anywhere #2 attempting to time the market.
BEAR12|This is a problem that many investors face beginners and experience so little knowledge can be a dangerous thing and frequently puts new investors at the whims of powerful psychological forces.
NEUT13|They are ill equipped to deal with these direct stock purchase plans when you set him up to regularly invest overtime, prevent that.
NEUT14|It's out of your hands.
NEUT15|It's going on no matter what.
NEUT16|You don't have to think about anything #3 following failing to reinvest dividends unless an investor has read some investing books, they most likely have no idea how important.
NEUT17|Reinvesting dividends is over the long term, so we have this little chart we put together for you right here.
NEUT18|Kind of shows the effect of reinvesting dividends, so we're looking at the S&P 500 here and over a 10 year.
NEUT19|We have one 2% return.
NEUT20|For those people that reinvest the dividends.
NEUT21|Those that didn't reinvestment receive 65%.
BULL22|So the dividend people that reinvested beat the folks that did it by 57%.
NEUT23|That's huge folks gotta reinvest those dividends.
NEUT24|You're leaving a lot of money on the table if you don't do it #4, though.
NEUT25|Being too intimidated at the prospect of buying a stock.
NEUT26|So let's say you're getting started investing.
NEUT27|You've got to open a brokerage account.
NEUT28|If you do it the traditional way.
NEUT29|That Wall Street would like you to Brokage interfaces are very intimidated for people that aren't familiar with them.
NEUT30|You have things like bid, ask prices, the different order types and ticker symbols.
NEUT31|So I brought a few examples here.
NEUT32|So if you look at the E trade interface trying to tell my sister what kind of orders you should put in here really complicated, next we have trade King here.
NEUT33|Try to tell my buddy with little to no investment experience what duration he should use when he's trying to buy his first stock.
NEUT34|That's really intimidated with direct stock purchase plans.
NEUT35|It's really easy.
NEUT36|All you do is you log in, you put in your personal information, you link your checking account, you select what type of investment plan you want.
NEUT37|Do you want to reinvest those dividends as we highlighted yet?
NEUT38|Definitely do and you can select if you want to do the monthly investing option and that's it.
BULL39|You're good to go.
NEUT40|You're saving for retirement.
NEUT41|You're thinking about the future.
NEUT42|So takeaway here, folks, my grandpa started a direct stock purchase plan for me over 10 years ago, and Microsoft and that really got me thinking about investing and saving for retirement in early age.
BULL43|And it was great.
NEUT44|You don't have to feel like you need to invest every month with these direct stock purchase plans.
NEUT45|You don't have to do that, you can just reinvest the dividends and it's great way just to get started investing and saving for the future I put a table below of some of the companies available to invest with these plans in America stock and computer share and you can link to those websites.
NEUT46|There's investors can also visit Vanguard site, the ETF operator and invest in their ETS at a very low cost too.
NEUT47|Although their minimum is $3000.00.
NEUT48|So if you don't have that much money saved up, you might not be able to do that.
NEUT49|Right away I still use direct stock purchase plans myself, 'cause I think they're great and help me avoid poor decisions and I'd highly recommend anybody that's looking to get a start invested to check them out.
NEUT50|That's why I have today for you folks.
BULL51|"Thanks for watching and Foulon."""
