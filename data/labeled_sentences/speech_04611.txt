BULL9|Yeah, it looks fantastic.
BULL10|We've had since what 2009 we've had 10 strong years of parabolic growth.
NEUT11|This is just beautiful until we fell underneath this parabola.
BEAR12|The problem starting the break and we've got a rising wedge which is really weak.
BEAR13|It's just weakening, weakening, weakening as it gets higher and higher and so our immediate target.
NEUT14|By about this date.
NEUT15|Which is going to be.
NEUT16|About August, about August 2019.
NEUT17|So we got six months until we retrace down to.
NEUT18|That's the first target is not so bad.
NEUT19|The first target is going to be about 190, so that gives us a good six percent, 5-6 percent loss over the next six months, seven months.
NEUT20|But after that.
NEUT21|We're not going to get support until we get down here in this range 150, so that's $200 to $150.
NEUT22|That's all.
BEAR23|That's a huge loss, and it's indicative of what's going to happen with the Dow Jones and NASDAQ Wall Street in general and the stock markets in general.
NEUT24|So here this is the annotation mode.
BEAR25|Multiple attempts to break back into the parabolic advance, but there's a rising wedge on the weekly, so for the next three years looks like about a 30% loss.
NEUT26|Will the Fed step in and rescue Wall Street that is going to require updated videos.
