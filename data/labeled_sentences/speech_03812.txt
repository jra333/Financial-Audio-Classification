NEUT0|"""What should we expect and I always ask this."
NEUT1|Are you supposed to have already bought on on the news or on the rumor and sell on the news if you will on a day like today when Apple comes out with all these new products?
BULL2|So in the case of Apple, the fact the stock was able to hit a $2 trillion market cap without the single sale of a 5G iPhone is remarkable.
NEUT3|But in this case, when you think about the potential for 5G to result in multiple years.
NEUT4|Of product unit sales.
BULL5|Positive unit sales for Apple?
NEUT6|I think you're a buyer on the event.
NEUT7|So historically you buy on the news and perhaps sell in the event.
BEAR8|But given the potential for this to create a multi year tailwind for the stock you buy in the event.
NEUT9|So just so we're clear there's going to be several phones that are going to be announced today.
NEUT10|5G of course part of all of those phones.
NEUT11|What are you expecting in terms of the various price points in terms of unit volume off of those phones then?
NEUT12|So what's unique is the launch of the sea earlier this calendar year as a lower price point option.
NEUT13|So it's possible that today's announcement may not have a dedicated low end phone, and the SC may have served that purpose.
NEUT14|So really what you're looking for today is potentially the most expensive iPhone ever.
NEUT15|When you think about the prospect of a large screen 5G Apple device.
NEUT16|So I think what you're looking for today is numerous phones.
NEUT17|As you pointed out.
BULL18|And that leverage the 5G network, including what should be the most expensive iPhone to date.
NEUT19|And just so we're clear, at least as the rumors go, we're talking about $1100 phone, right?
NEUT20|Absolutely yes.
NEUT21|How big a market do you think there is for $1100 phone right now?
BULL22|I think there's a large market for a big format 5G iPhone, so I think that there's a tremendous amount of pent up demand.
NEUT23|But what makes this situation unique is that the 5G network, specially United States, is not really ready for prime time.
NEUT24|So I think what you're going to see is more phones being sold as networks upgrade over the next couple of years.
NEUT25|And it moves from within areas of large cities to across the United States and I think, really, that's the big opportunity.
NEUT26|And why Apple stock has done so well into this upgrade cycle that it looks to be multi year Tom.
NEUT27|Tom, I think you're speaking though two to the single issue that I hear investors talking about right now and just people in the communications industry, which is.
NEUT28|This suggests that 5G is not widely adopted or widely available across the country.
NEUT29|In fact, with the way the report suggests is that the phone will throttle between 5G and 4G, oftentimes partially save battery.
NEUT30|But I also imagine partially because that 5G is just not going to be there.
NEUT31|So how much is it going to be a super cycle this year versus really a super cycle next year?
NEUT32|Or potentially even pushed out a year beyond that.
BULL33|Or is there an argument can be made that if it's dependent on the network that you're right, 21 May be better than 20, but I think to the extent that you have pent up demand, consumers have been waiting multiple years to get their hands on a 5G and iPhone on a materially faster network.
BULL34|20 ought to be quite good as well.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
