BEAR0|"""Alright, so Disney is at $185.92 with a market cap of 337.49 billion so sadly we hit that 200 and now we're dropping."
NEUT1|That's good for me 'cause I like to buy Disney under 200.
NEUT2|That's my.
NEUT3|That's my price where anything above it.
BULL4|I will now buy, so that's great.
NEUT5|But sadly I would love to be above that 200.
BULL6|So in today's news new plan at Disneyland calls for squeezing in more rides, restaurants and shops so.
BULL7|Despite a deadly pandemic closing a theme park for a year, Walt Disney Company has begun charting a course for the future by announcing plans Thursday to upgrade and renovate its Anaheim Resort with new attractions, shops, restaurants within its existing 490 acre footprint.
NEUT8|So the plan is called Disneyland forward.
NEUT9|And ensure.
BULL10|Disney is going to squeeze in.
NEUT11|Probably every everything possible.
NEUT12|There they know that they lost millions and ability probably billions of dollars with Disney Disneyland being closed and they know that if they put up a little money and they throw in additional rides, resorts, food vending areas, everything that they can make up for that lost money and it's going to take a few years probably.
BULL13|But that's great.
NEUT14|This is what I want to see their squeezing everything in possible.
NEUT15|To utilize the most of their land and generate money an they need to do that in Disneyland 'cause they were closed that hit them big.
NEUT16|So this is what I want to see.
BULL17|That's how I think they're going to be able to double their stock stock price and market cap.
NEUT18|An yeah just stay on top of this.
