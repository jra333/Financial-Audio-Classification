NEUT0|"""Hey, it's time for the futures outlook."
BEAR1|The dollar is now positive after touching its lowest level since 2018.
BEAR2|Still, on pace to to close out its worst month in a decade.
NEUT3|For more on how futures traders are navigating all of that, let's bring in Bill Baruch of Blue Line Futures and Scott Nations of Nations indexes.
NEUT4|Scott nations.
NEUT5|You first you give me the fundamentals on where you think the dollar is going and why.
BEAR6|Scott, we lose sight of the fact that it's relative rates that drive the dollar and over the past 52 weeks our 10 year yield is dropped by 147 basis points.
NEUT7|147 basis points.
NEUT8|Compare that to Germany.
NEUT9|There's this fallen 9 basis points.
NEUT10|Japan is actually increased so the Fed doesn't care about the dollar.
NEUT11|Right now they're caring about their care about jobs right now.
NEUT12|That's the fire they want to put out as far as they are concerned, the dollar is what comes next.
BEAR13|That's the water damage after they put out the fire.
NEUT14|Bill, technically, how do we look?
BEAR15|Discuss right the dollars been the sacrificial lamb if you will, but ultimately what we're seeing here is the dollar broken new low.
BEAR16|It took out the June low and then it just precipitated lower the euro.
NEUT17|The dollar Index is a basket of currencies, the dollar.
BULL18|The dollar index is made up by 57%.
BULL19|The euro euros at the highest level since 2018 and has led the way British pound as well as the Japanese yen or another 25% combined there.
NEUT20|But focusing on the Euro, I want to show you this chart.
NEUT21|It goes back in 2009.
NEUT22|It's a monthly charge.
NEUT23|It's going to be huge here for the day where closes.
BULL24|It's gone up to this trend line and it's touched.
NEUT25|It's not out above it here today and closing at one 18118 a quarter out above there would be a breakout below there would not and then the dollar index very similar trend line from 2011 comes in right about 92.
NEUT26|A lines of 382 retracement almost got there last night.
NEUT27|Not quite but nice reversal on the monthly in for those charts, right?
NEUT28|Good stuff gents.
BULL29|"Thanks good weekend you both."""
