NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, what to expect from NIO tomorrow?
NEUT2|Alright, let's get started an IO as well as other stock.
BEAR3|We're down to Thursdays selling pressure to Wall Street with major market benchmarks giving up ground but finishing well off their worst levels of the day.
BEAR4|The Dow Jones Industrial average joined the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite with declines.
BEAR5|Shares of NIO are down 5% on Thursday due to the market's volatility.
NEUT6|But where does that leave Nio with all the volatility in the market surrounding it?
NEUT7|The answer is to look at the market and how it is trading overall market analysis.
BEAR8|The stock market rally is in a modestly weak trend, showing elements of a broad based pull back as well as a sector rotation out of growth.
BEAR9|The NASDAQ, S&P and Dow Jones fell intraday Thursday to just above its 21 day exponential moving average, where it began paring losses.
BULL10|The 21 day line was a key area of support for the NASDAQ during the April to November stock market rally as well as the current.
BEAR11|Uptrend analysts suspect that the NASDAQ will quickly rebound to record highs or trade sideways in its current range for a time after this week.
BEAR12|For now, the markets are breaking through their 21 day lines, what to expect from NIO, according to analysts, we suspected NIO will not go below its support level of $54.00 and $53 tomorrow.
BULL13|The market is currently very volatile at this time and as a result long should see protection at the $54.00 and $53 next week.
BULL14|We should see a recovery of the market's 50 day moving average line.
BEAR15|Thus causing an IO and others in its section to bounce back.
