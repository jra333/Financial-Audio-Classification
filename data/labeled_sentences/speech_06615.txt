NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BULL1|Today will be looking at Euro USD on the daily chart so zooming in we can see that the euro is trying to push over the upper boundary of the McLeod at one point 1063 after the drop on November 4th bounced off the one point.
NEUT2|10:05 support which is the 23.6% fewer natural retracement of the down leg for one point.
NEUT3|1411 to 1.08 seventy 8.
BEAR4|However, the bearish crossover by the downward sloping taken centerline leans towards a down move, while the turn back down in the 20 day simple moving average.
BEAR5|Reinforces the bigger negative picture.
BULL6|The short term oscillators are still in the negative region, but suggest some improvement in the price.
NEUT7|The Flat 50 day Ismey Anchin Johnson lines.
NEUT8|Are worth mentioning suggesting that the price could stall for a while.
BULL9|If the sellers managed to push the pair back down, initial support could come from the 50 day SMAP at one point 1040 while lowering the cloud.
BEAR10|The 23.6% fibo of one point 10:05 and slightly beneath the slick.
BEAR11|The swing low of 1.09, nineteen surpassing this a support area from 1.09 forty to one point zero 925 could challenge the Bears ahead of the multi year low of 1.08 seventy.
BEAR12|8 to the upside, a tough resistance region from one point 1063 to one point 1019 where the 2100 day Smad kindred Sunline an 38.2% Fibo are located.
BULL13|Could deny a further climb to test the 50% fibo of one point 1145 and 200 day SMAD residing at the one point 1175 Swing High.
BEAR14|In brief, the short term looks neutral to bearish and a break below 1.09.
BEAR15|Ninety would reinforce the negative sentiment.
BULL16|However, a break above one point 1175 could return a medium term neutral bias.
NEUT17|That's it from me.
BULL18|"Have a great trading day."""
