NEUT0|"""Welcome back guys to another video and today we're going to be talking about Long View ticker symbol L GVW."
NEUT1|They're going to be having emerged in Q1 2020, one with Butterfly, but of course right before I get right into the video, please smash that subscribe button as well.
NEUT2|Turn on that boat notification so you can notify yourself on whenever I upload a video to keep yourself up to date on why the markets going up and why the markets going down alright.
NEUT3|So now let's get straight into it.
NEUT4|Why is Longview to LGW?
NEUT5|Trading sideways, what's it doing?
NEUT6|This hasn't been moving for a month.
NEUT7|Well, it's just building a support line.
BEAR8|That's why it's consolidating as in right now this is super healthy for the stock itself, because when you do see an upside like if it jumps to 1617 or $18.00 and then has a massive pullback, you're most likely going to see it's going to drop to around 15 to 1550 because that's where the support line is.
NEUT9|And that's what it's doing right now.
NEUT10|Alright, so now look at this.
NEUT11|The reason why it's consolidating as in, right?
BULL12|Right now with the 15 to $16.00 ranges because it's up so much it's up 56% year to date as well.
BULL13|The highest point in got two with 76%, which is insane as well.
BULL14|Super healthy for the stock itself because once we do see another run up, you're not going to see the support line being 15 to $16.00 as well.
BULL15|It's going to be $17.00 if we ever get back to that point, which I believe we are OK Now for my price prediction.
NEUT16|Or do I see the stock going in one?
NEUT17|Two years, well, I see at least at least going to 25 to $30.
NEUT18|The only reason why is because I see what they're doing and the service that providing these hospitals or like health industry in general is insane.
NEUT19|Why is it insane?
NEUT20|Well, because their device, which is the ultrasound, is it costing them $2000.
NEUT21|On top of that?
NEUT22|That service that they're providing is $55, which is their monthly subscription.
NEUT23|If you look at the ultrasounds that the hospitals are using, as in right now they're costing at least at least 10.
NEUT24|1000 to $60,000.
NEUT25|That's insane.
NEUT26|Meanwhile you could just get this device, which is costing you $2000 + 55 or $100 a month to do the ultrasound for you.
NEUT27|You get the results and called it a day.
NEUT28|Almost forgot to.
NEUT29|You can literally bring this device anywhere you can bring it to the cottage.
NEUT30|You can bring into the washroom.
NEUT31|You can bring into the bed.
NEUT32|I don't know, man, you could bring this **** anywhere but LA Doulas did.
NEUT33|You think I was it?
NEUT34|No no no no no no listen.
NEUT35|Bill Gates as well or converse or invested into this company find you.
NEUT36|Bill Gates probably invested into this company just because he wants to support the health industry.
NEUT37|OK, he wants to make sure everybody has the right healthcare worldwide.
BULL38|OK so for Butterfly to provide a device which is only costing them $2000 + 5200 dollar monthly subscription would be beneficial for the mines in Africa.
NEUT39|Most of them do not have ultrasounds.
NEUT40|OK so for this to be.
NEUT41|Only worth $2000 more affordable.
BULL42|Imagine Africa would be willing to buy this.
NEUT43|OK anyways, that's about it guys.
BULL44|"Hope you guys enjoyed the video smash that subscribe button as well to that Bell notification on so you can be notified on whenever I upload a video please."""
