NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, my name is Stan and I'm coming to you from San Marcos, CA."
NEUT1|Collins College class of 2016 Ann.
NEUT2|I'm here to show you a little bit about stock trading from your phone in an app.
NEUT3|This is my investment analyst Donald.
NEUT4|He's going to be assisting me today.
NEUT5|There are many wonderful apps to use for stock trading available in the App Store and Android.
NEUT6|My personal favorite though is Robin Hood because it is entirely free of Commission charges.
NEUT7|Investing in your first stock is as easy as downloading the app from the App Store.
NEUT8|If you're going to open the app after you register your account and start funding it, you will be given the option to look up.
NEUT9|Any number of stocks to invest.
NEUT10|My advice for picking your first stock is pick a company that you know and care about and start small.
NEUT11|Don't get too aggressive in the beginning, you'll always have time to increase.
NEUT12|Your investment.
NEUT13|Portfolio is linked to checking account to your Robin Hood app.
NEUT14|You can now go in and buy a stock.
NEUT15|Select the number of shares you want to purchase and then just swipe up to buy in the next market trading day.
NEUT16|Your order should be executed.
NEUT17|How do you choose the best stock you ask?
NEUT18|Well, the key is having the right tools at true disposal to make the best decision.
BULL19|Thank you so much for watching and from your Collins college family.
BULL20|"Be safe and be well."""
