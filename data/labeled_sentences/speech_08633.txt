NEUT0|"""He's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also.
NEUT5|For disclaimer standpoint I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement accounts, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis here.
NEUT6|Well overall things are looking very shaky now and the reason for the shakiness has to do with this green line right here at one 12:50 if you've been watching the past videos then that level should sound familiar.
BULL7|That's been a very important level of support.
NEUT8|That's been, you know.
BULL9|Being monitored and to be fair, did do a good job.
BEAR10|Once again is acting as support price actually bounced, but unfortunately in the last 30 minutes you can see the price is now broken down through that level.
NEUT11|So that brings about a more than valid question of yeah, is this the start of something much bigger?
NEUT12|Are the Bears showing up?
NEUT13|You know in a bigger way, Debbie Fair?
NEUT14|Maybe this is just one of these faulty breakdowns where it's kind of like the Bulls are playing a joke on the Bears gonna say that just kidding.
NEUT15|And then, you know, get the price moving back upwards.
NEUT16|But like I said, it's a more than a valid and rational thought to be having right now.
NEUT17|That maybe, just maybe, the Bears are about to show up and make another big you know, attempted move to the downside.
NEUT18|Which is where this next very important level of support comes into play, and that level is down here around the 110 mark, so 110 in my opinion, is now in play.
NEUT19|Not saying that necessarily is going to get hit on Thursday, but my point here being I don't think anybody would be shocked to see.
NEUT20|The price drift down and then just continue to kind of slowly move down to that.
BULL21|Larry am 110, though I would expect to put up a very big fight.
NEUT22|As you can see a couple of times right there.
BEAR23|You know the Bears were down there and failed miserably to breakdown through it.
BEAR24|Couple very nice bounces both times, but overall those going to the main levels of support in the event the price does try to reverse around key area of resistance in the near term is going to be the purple line there.
NEUT25|The 50.
NEUT26|Moving average you can see right there, the price rejected it and then once again projected it.
NEUT27|Current value of that right up there around we'll just call it 100.
BEAR28|$14.00 But yeah, things are looking shaky right now.
NEUT29|We'll see how things play out on Thursday.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL34|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT41|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
