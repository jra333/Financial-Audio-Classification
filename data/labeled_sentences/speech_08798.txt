NEUT0|"""It is said that the mergers are usually undertaken to unlock value."
NEUT1|The ironic group seems like the prime example to this victim or an enterprise is the incubating armor for any group has delivered 1100% to shareholders in the last five years.
NEUT2|Yes, you heard it right.
NEUT3|If you're running thousand shares of our enterprises as of June, 2015 would have costed a little over one like rupees is currently valued over â‚¹13,00,000 as of 2020.
NEUT4|So here's the math.
NEUT5|If you're running thousands of our enterprises in 2015, you got thousands of ironic transmission in 2015, you got 761.
NEUT6|Is there any green in 2018 and you got another thousand shares of or any gas in 2018?
NEUT7|You gotta run enterprises in many years.
NEUT8|In 2007, the demo support business in 2009 that emerged running power and after 2015 three companies got emerged out of our enterprises running transmission organic green and organic gas.
NEUT9|Now look at any transmission which were listed in 2015.
NEUT10|It listed with a market cap of just 3080 Crows in 2015 and in 2020 it is commanding a market cap of 30,000 cross look at.
NEUT11|Ronnie Green it listed in 2018 with a market cap of just 4500 pros and currently in 2020.
NEUT12|It is having a market cap of over 1 lacros.
NEUT13|That's the kind of value were created in Ronnie Green.
NEUT14|You got any gas again it got destroyed in 2018 with a market cap of just 8000 crows and in 2020 it is commanding a market cap of 21,000 cross.
NEUT15|So that's the kind of value creation which happened in the last five years.
NEUT16|But that's last five years.
NEUT17|The key question is what sort of opportunity and value unlocking is likely in the near future.
NEUT18|The answer to this question lies.
NEUT19|The next set of incubating portfolios within enterprises you got any airports they already proposed to acquire.
BULL20|The Mumbai Airport from GBC and they have six portfolios right now within our any airports, the company aims to become one of the largest airport operator in the world in the near future.
NEUT21|The second business is the coal mining businesses.
NEUT22|They're one of the largest developer and operator of coal mining India.
NEUT23|With the production capacity of 15.5 million tonne.
NEUT24|Not only that, they're chasing with one of the dream projects which is the Australian coal mine.
BULL25|After years of controversy.
BEAR26|Setbacks.
BULL27|Finally, the company has all the approvals to start the mining business in Australia.
NEUT28|So the first shipment from the chemical coal mine is going to start in the first half of FY22 last but not the least, the FMCG business or any group there.
NEUT29|There were joint venture 5050 with Wilma International and the company is already focusing on the consumer brands.
NEUT30|It's under the brand fortune and they currently have a market share of close to 20% in the retail packaged food businesses.
NEUT31|So that's the few businesses which can emerge now.
NEUT32|The key question is why investors have made 11X returns in the last five years.
NEUT33|"Looking at the company's strategy currently and the kind of promises that many of these companies have over the next few years, the key is to patiently wait and watch and see how these businesses emerged as next business leaders and become independent ventures like it happened in a running gas and Army green."""
