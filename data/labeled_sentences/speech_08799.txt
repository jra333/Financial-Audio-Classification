NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, if you watch this video from yesterday, a lot of these levels are going to sound very familiar, but confirmation would probably be the best word to describe today's price.
BULL5|We went because the levels that I've talked about in previous videos were all confirmed as being very important and very relevant to the chart moving forward.
NEUT6|Now, the first bit of confirmation we got was, well, it happened a couple of times, but is in regards to this red line here, which again means a little bit more of those you that watch past videos.
NEUT7|But even if you did it, I've been talking about that red line key level of resistance at 122 and you can see that this morning.
NEUT8|Yeah, the price got up above it but didn't really stay above it that long.
NEUT9|Fell back below it and then as soon as the price fell back below it right there.
NEUT10|Notice what happened.
NEUT11|The price did try to get up above it but you can see right there.
BEAR12|Failed miserably and then later on in the day.
BULL13|In fact the last 30 minutes of the day again, try to make another surge to the upside, but once again failed miserably and back down it went.
NEUT14|So the more of the stories is.
NEUT15|I'm not saying that the price can never ever get back above 122.
NEUT16|I'm just saying it's become very apparent that 122 is a very key level of resistance, meaning a lot of people are going to be watching that level.
NEUT17|And lots of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy called whatever you want.
NEUT18|It can produce some very dynamic movements, so while nothing is guaranteed, my point is is that if the price does consolidate out.
NEUT19|Work its way up there and then get the break of that area.
NEUT20|It's more than valid.
NEUT21|It's a more than a rational thought to be having that.
NEUT22|Hey, that could create some big upside buying pressure again, nothing is guaranteed to happen, but that's at least the rational thought to be having.
NEUT23|So keep a close eye on the 122 mark from the resistance side of things.
NEUT24|Another bit of confirmation we got was in regards to that green line.
BEAR25|There again, talked about that's level of support in past videos and you can see that on a couple different occasions the price bounced right off from that level.
NEUT26|So moving forward you're going to continue to watch that one 1975 Mark as a key level of support, but overall those are definitely the two main levels at lots and lots of traders are watching.
NEUT27|So let's see if the price cannot get the break out or you know overall continue on with the trend.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
