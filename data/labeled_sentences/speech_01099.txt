BEAR0|"""Who is Mike and I wanna talk about a stock that's been beaten up lately, but I do think it has a big potential to bounce back in the fourth quarter because we're going to have this second wave of the virus most likely come this winter."
NEUT1|And there's also a arc invest Kathy Woods has made a big investment into this company and I'm talking about Netflix now.
BEAR2|If you look at the year to date chart on Netflix, it's been doing pretty well, but it's been kind of beaten up lately, and it's been in general since July trading.
NEUT3|Can arrange so if you are an investor in Netflix for the past three months, you have probably not very happy.
NEUT4|However, like I said, winter is coming.
BEAR5|People are going to be in their houses more often than they were with the lock down and we may have this second wave coming, so that may have people locked down even more.
NEUT6|So what do you do when you're at home?
NEUT7|You're probably going to watch streaming services, and Netflix may see a lot of new subscriptions come up.
NEUT8|Also, if you look at Ark W, which is one of our parks.
NEUT9|ETF is the next generation ETF.
NEUT10|The Holdings.
BULL11|Here it shows they have really increased their position on Netflix.
NEUT12|RW Now holds 100 and 24,000 shares with a market value of 60 million.
NEUT13|That's about 2% of the company.
NEUT14|2% of the Holdings of Ark W. Now if you look at this this like they said, next generation Internet, you have Wicks in here Lending Club doc you sign.
BEAR15|Zoom, these are all definitely disruptive Internet companies.
NEUT16|Spotify snap, Facebook Pinterest Teslas here, which is kind of interesting.
NEUT17|I don't know exactly why it's next generation Internet.
NEUT18|I'm sure you know Kathy, which is so smart.
NEUT19|She has a reason why Netflix would be in this ETF.
NEUT20|But this is definitely DTF.
NEUT21|You see, like Amazon HubSpot, but Netflix is their 21st largest Holdings.
NEUT22|And I just wanted to bring them up because Netflix is a stock that's probably not on a lot of people's radar.
NEUT23|But if it's an Ark, invest in Kathy.
NEUT24|Which radar.
NEUT25|It's definitely a stock.
NEUT26|You should take a look at.
NEUT27|Firstly, I would wait until it breaks out of this trading range before I would trade it, but if it breaks out of this trading range, I think it has the potential to go a lot higher because.
NEUT28|The 52 week high is 575.
NEUT29|So if we could break to 5:50, I think it would definitely.
BULL30|Netflix would definitely head up to 575 and maybe beyond that if in the new year we're still, you know locked down and dealing with.
NEUT31|Virus issues so definitely take a look at Netflix.
NEUT32|Put that on your radar.
NEUT33|I think that might be something in December or even mid November that you want it make.
NEUT34|Take a look at so hope you enjoy this video.
