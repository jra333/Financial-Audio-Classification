BULL0|"""Hi everybody, Jason Moser here analyst with Motley Fool, One thanks for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool today."
NEUT1|We're taking a question from Jim Ramsey who asks is it better to buy one higher price stock or multiple low price stocks?
NEUT2|In the example Jim uses is if you have $500 is it better to buy one share of something like Apple or 30 shares of something like Ford?
NEUT3|And so I think that's an interesting question.
NEUT4|You know there's not.
NEUT5|There's no one path.
NEUT6|Answer For this question and really it kind of keys in on one of the biggest challenges we face here in teaching the world.
NEUT7|To invest better and that's making sure folks understand the difference between value and price.
NEUT8|It could very well be that a $500 stock is cheap while a $17.00 stock is actually expensive.
NEUT9|I know it sounds odd, but that is actually the case.
NEUT10|It all depends on the fundamentals of the business.
NEUT11|Depends on how the company is growing, how it's performing is the company growing.
NEUT12|Sales doesn't have a repeatable business.
NEUT13|Is there a powerful brand or their strong competitive positions?
BULL14|Is management reliable?
NEUT15|I mean, these are all the questions that we look at when we assess companies as potential investments, so we don't really focus on the dollar value of the stock price, so to speak.
