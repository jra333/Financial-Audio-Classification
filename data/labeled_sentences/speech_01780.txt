BULL0|"""Disney shares are enjoying their best quarter since 2009."
BULL1|The entertainment giant has rallied nearly 30% since April as investors look past the Corona virus pandemic to the company's eventual rebound tread carefully here warns Matt Meili, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak.
BULL2|It's very similar to what it saw in late March after its initial balance after a big sell off in the first quarter, Maley said Thursday on CNBC's Trading Nation, just as then.
BEAR3|He warns it could be getting overbought after its steep run.
NEUT4|It could pull back.
NEUT5|You don't want to be too aggressive up here if it should hit a ceiling.
NEUT6|Meili identifies two key levels that could provide opportunities to buy at lower levels.
BEAR7|The 200 week moving average down at about $114.00 that's provided excellent support for the stock, so that's the level you want to get more aggressive, he said.
NEUT8|If for some reason the market gets hit and this gets thrown out.
BEAR9|Baby gets thrown out with the bathwater.
BULL10|The $100 level that's provided great support back in May.
NEUT11|That's where you really want to back up the truck.
NEUT12|So be a little cautious up here.
NEUT13|Get aggressive at $114.00 and buy it with both hands.
BEAR14|If it gets anywhere near $100, Disney would need to fall 7% from current levels to reach $114.00.
BEAR15|A declined to $100 marks.
BULL16|Nearly 20% downside, Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, says Disney looks solid as it reopens its theme parks worldwide.
BULL17|It received approval last week from the state of Florida to reopen its four Orlando based theme parks starting July 11th.
BULL18|If you look at parks, everything has shown that Disney has tremendous pricing power and tremendous brand value.
BEAR19|Now obviously they have a tremendous amount going against them, she said in the same interview.
BEAR20|Quite frankly, the valuation is reflecting all of those positives, and so it's not necessarily well valued.
BULL21|But its balance sheet is very good.
BULL22|It has good net interest coverage.
NEUT23|It has access to debt and it definitely as a survivor.
BEAR24|Disney shares are one of the worst performers on the Dow this year, having fallen.
BEAR25|"15% they remain 20% off November highs."""
