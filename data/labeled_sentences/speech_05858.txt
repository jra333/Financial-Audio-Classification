NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taken looking at the S&P 500, and as you can see the S&P 500 looks as if it's trying to roll over now."
NEUT1|I would also point out that we are awaiting the Federal Reserve statement, so the market may get a dose of courage as soon as J PAL informs everybody that they're still willing to bail everybody out.
NEUT2|3100 would be.
NEUT3|A buying opportunity.
BULL4|The 3000 level underneath should be massive support.
NEUT5|And therefore I think one of these two levels will probably be where we buy back in.
NEUT6|"I don't really see any reason why I want to go to the high, as we've already done it in the NASDAQ 100."""
