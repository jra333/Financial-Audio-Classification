BULL0|"""Mike, I'm so glad to have you here."
NEUT1|We don't have a lot of time.
NEUT2|I'm going to cut right to the chase.
NEUT3|How bad is it and what can be done to forestall a really deep recession at this point?
BULL4|Hi Kelly, thanks for having me on.
BEAR5|It's pretty bad as your previous guest just said, this is a huge shock so you know, avoiding a recession is probably going to be impossible now.
BEAR6|And it looks like so far policy makers, both on the fiscal and monetary side has simply been overwhelmed by this crisis.
NEUT7|This tsunami is hitting us, but they have to try and they have to do more in the key.
NEUT8|Now is what kind of recovery do we have on the other side of this thing?
BEAR9|Because it does look like the downturn is going to be quite sharp.
NEUT10|How is sharp and how long?
NEUT11|It's really impossible to know at this point.
NEUT12|I mean, essentially you have the economy coming to a sudden stop, not just here, but around the world.
BEAR13|We don't have enough data yet to know what that actually means, but some of the numbers coming out of China are quite scary, so this could be in the trillions of dollars.
BULL14|Very large, and so I know some of the announcements seem impressive on the fiscal side based on sheer numbers, but relative to the shock that we might be getting here.
BEAR15|We could have a situation where there simply inadequate.
NEUT16|At this juncture, you think that you know, and so far we've barely kind of wrote, broached the $1 trillion.
NEUT17|I mean, how many trillions are we talking?
NEUT18|And if not, you know what's going to happen to the markets.
BULL19|Well, as much in as long as it takes to fully recover from this.
NEUT20|I mean we do have a backdrop where it's almost free to borrow money so you know so the numbers shouldn't scare us off #2 with respect to the Federal Reserve.
NEUT21|You know they are taking what appears to be aggressive action, but so far nothing doing on inflation expectations.
BEAR22|If you watched the tips, inflation break even spread market, you have inflation expectations declining at the fastest rate of descent since the dark days of 2000.
NEUT23|Kate, so basically we need to, you know to keep moving forward until that starts to turn around.
NEUT24|One thing that the Fed might consider in the future.
NEUT25|You know there are limited to what they can do, bound by the Federal Reserve Act, but announcing some kind of a level path target for inflation.
NEUT26|I'd prefer nominal GDP, but this was something that came up in the Fed.
NEUT27|The Fed's listen discussions.
NEUT28|But to basically commit to restoring.
NEUT29|Output or inflation to where it would have been before this shock hits.
NEUT30|That way you know if we're talking about asset purchases or even fiscal policy markets need to know that policy makers will not stand down until the economy is fully faulted out of this hole that we're likely falling into now.
NEUT31|Yeah, and I can tell from the tone of your voice that we haven't gotten that message yet, and we're not there yet.
BULL32|Mike, thanks.
NEUT33|Hopefully add some urgency to it.
BULL34|"I appreciate it very much."""
