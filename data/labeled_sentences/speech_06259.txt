NEUT0|"""Hey, it's September 4th, 2013 and it's Wednesday."
NEUT1|I'd like to do the end of the day recap now.
NEUT2|Today things moved a little bit differently.
BULL3|Moved to the upside with a little bit of positive momentum.
NEUT4|Now you remember that we talked about this 14,890 level as being previous support and kind of resistance.
NEUT5|I talked about this for quite some time and we did break it a little bit earlier last week on 827, 2013 and now we're kind of moving beyond that were.
BULL6|We bouncing off at this level here, so basically we're drawing in a new support level now.
NEUT7|Can they stocks go back up here right around this region and retest it.
NEUT8|Yes, it can.
BULL9|Now things have been kind of moving up today.
NEUT10|Now they haven't been going on higher volume.
BULL11|They've been a little bit on lighter volume, but they are moving up now.
BEAR12|Yesterday we had a bearish day.
BULL13|I would say even those are net positive day.
BEAR14|It still was bearish 'cause it pushed to the downside, but today it kind of pushed to the upside and things finished to the upside.
NEUT15|So looking as well at the SMP 500 again the same thing kind of happened.
NEUT16|We're pushing higher to the upside now we can move this line level down here and now this is somewhat creating our new support pattern here, so this is kind of creating a new base and you know we're going to have to wait and see till tomorrow.
NEUT17|And see if there's a follow through day, but if you look at some of the stocks like the apples, you'll see that it jumped today.
BULL18|$10.18 A jump 2%.
NEUT19|That's a pretty large move.
NEUT20|If you look at Google as well, you know it was watching this line or region and you know again we moved higher on it.
NEUT21|Now.
NEUT22|Like I mentioned, it wasn't on any higher volume or anything like that.
NEUT23|It was a little bit more than average, but it wasn't on anything.
NEUT24|Ginormous so it did move.
NEUT25|You have to respect the move and kind of watch it here on the 15 day and see.
BULL26|OK, it did move past the previous previous days high over here.
BULL27|And it broke through that.
NEUT28|And then it held that so because it did move through that on a little bit higher.
NEUT29|Volume here on intraday you do have to respect the move now on the daily it wasn't anything amazing volume.
NEUT30|It was pretty much basic volume, Amazon as well.
BULL31|Same thing it held that support line that we talked about the other day and it continued to move higher pushing that 300 Netflix again also pushing towards that 300 holding that support level and moving and pushing higher.
NEUT32|Was it on higher volume?
NEUT33|No it was on.
NEUT34|Average volume, so we'll see where things take it over the next day or two, but those are just a couple of the stocks that I've been watching, so with that being said, I hope you have a great day trading well, be patient.
NEUT35|If you're looking to get into this market long and just stick to your stops.
BULL36|"Alright, have a great day."""
