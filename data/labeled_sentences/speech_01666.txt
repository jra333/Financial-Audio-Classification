NEUT0|"""Asks why corporate boards aren't doing more to prevent their leaders from risking their health and terrifying their shareholders."
NEUT1|Here to explain is John Stahl.
NEUT2|He's the business columnist at the Wall Street Journal and John the deaths on Mount Everest got you thinking about this.
NEUT3|Yeah, I mean, a year ago I talked to Greg, Penner was the Chairman of Walmart.
NEUT4|He told me this story.
NEUT5|I was I. I'm all about it.
NEUT6|I would love to climb Everest to my family.
NEUT7|Might have an issue with it but and then a year later I started to think about it like wait a minute.
NEUT8|You did what and just thinking about like how did the Board of Directors take this?
NEUT9|Greg is not the CEO.
NEUT10|To be fair, he's the chairman and he even said to me yesterday on the phone.
NEUT11|Listen, you know it had been the CEO of the company.
NEUT12|It might have been a different story.
NEUT13|First of all, it takes a lot of time but also just the risk.
NEUT14|The risk that.
NEUT15|We all take but if you think about it in the athlete sense.
NEUT16|We don't want you know the professional sports teams don't let their athletes do certain things that would harm them because there's such an investment.
NEUT17|We should think the same way about senior executives in the company.
NEUT18|You want boards to coddle their CEOs.
NEUT19|John you want them to be nannies to tell him you know make sure their seatbelts are buckled and and no you know fun.
NEUT20|Risky adventures for you right now.
NEUT21|I think it's it's a two way.
NEUT22|St #1, is you've got the risks which I think a lot of boards need to think about this is because the CEO oftentimes.
NEUT23|Is a risk taker.
BEAR24|They are an adrenaline junkie.
NEUT25|You don't want to bottle that up and take that spirit and that personality away, but at the same time there is.
NEUT26|I would give you the example of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg.
NEUT27|These are people who are who are who are mentioned in the 10K as risk factors and if they are risk factors then investors do have to have a bit of insight into what they're doing.
NEUT28|Just an example.
NEUT29|Sergio Marchione we talked about him last week.
NEUT30|He was until about a year before he died.
NEUT31|I know this first hand, he smoked a heck of a lot of cigarettes and that that is a risk to somebody's health, who embodies a bit more of the company strategy or probably has a bit more of the company strategy riding around in their head than the typical CEO.
NEUT32|So not all CEOs operate there.
NEUT33|What do you think should be required that there's disclosure about some of these potentially harmful behaviors that CEOs are engaged in?
NEUT34|Saying that there should be a discussion at the board level about whether those behaviors are thinking, but I think I think investors should be thinking about this and not just in the public sense.
NEUT35|I talked to a lot of venture companies who are.
NEUT36|In a situation where the founder or that the leader of the company is probably at a little bit more of an important intersection in the lifeblood of the company, meaning that their existence is very important in those early years.
NEUT37|And maybe if you're on a third, 4th, 5th, 6th Gen Generation CEO, it's not.
NEUT38|I'm not saying that their lifestyle is important, but what their their contribution to the company may be disproportionately lower.
NEUT39|So in particular, if you're investing in a startup to think about, we don't want our investors are CEO living.
BEAR40|Unhealthy lives and we also probably may be thinking twice about the risk that they're taking, or at least being have eyes wide open that this person jumps out of planes in their free time.
NEUT41|"Or they drive boats at 90 miles an hour or motorcycle, yeah, well."""
