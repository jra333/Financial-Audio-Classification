NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Tuesday, February 9th.
NEUT2|And the market is about to close.
NEUT3|Actually, it's almost 4:00 PM in this video I'm going to be talking about Innova Inc ticker symbol INUV.
NEUT4|As many of you know we have the earnings coming up on February 11th.
NEUT5|Currently in Novo is trading at 1.85.
BULL6|Which is at 12 point 8% increase from yesterday's price.
BEAR7|Looking at the RSI we it looks like we are entering into an overbought territory so it's something to watch out for and also the Mac D is indicating of a possible downward movement.
NEUT8|One of the big things I like to watch out for is how far is the stock price from the 20 email line which is here the red line so we could see it's.
NEUT9|There is some distance to it and always when it comes to pricing the price always tries to catch up with the 20 email line.
NEUT10|So one thing I notice in terms of a pattern and I'm sure you would see it too, is this rounding bottom over here?
NEUT11|Which could be indicated with Cup and handle pattern.
NEUT12|So just based on the Mac D, the RSI.
NEUT13|The position of the 20 MA.
BEAR14|All of these signals align that we could have a temporary downward movement just for a few more days.
NEUT15|And it's also aligned with the earning report.
NEUT16|Because usually people say buy the rumor, sell the news so every time there's an announcement, unless they really beat numbers, we should expect the movement.
NEUT17|To the downside, just for a few days I would say probably around the dollar $50.60 before we continue our movement here and watch out for if we reach to this price around the one dollar $1.85.
BULL18|If we have a confirmation after that, we could see a breakout price and rally back up to $2.00 and 35 price high, which was back in January 20th.
NEUT19|Switching over to the hourly chart we could see again the rounding bottom that so caring.
NEUT20|So if we do have a Cup and handle movement then we should be aligned.
BULL21|Close to the 50 email line around the $1.60 and if we reached that level then we could see a turning back up to the dollar $80.90 before we rally back up.
BULL22|If however, the earnings report provides a positive news catalysts then we could have a rally back up to the $2.35 range before this pattern even forms.
NEUT23|It's an updated video in the next few days to see if we can get a confirmation on this.
NEUT24|Pattern as usual.
NEUT25|"Thank you all for watching and see in the next video."""
