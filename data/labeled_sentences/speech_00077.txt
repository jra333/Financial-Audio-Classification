NEUT0|"""Hi folks, welcome to the channel Aaron here or as some of you know me, a a Ron and yes, it's Sunday night and I've got to talk about Neil."
NEUT1|I gotta really something heading into the trade week about Neo.
NEUT2|So here's what I've got.
BULL3|We saw a nice push at the end of the week with the Neo stock, but I think we've got a lot further to go.
NEUT4|The question is, will we see more of a push on Monday?
NEUT5|I think there's a possibility the seven months I've been treated or watching the stock monitoring things, they often have a Green Day on Monday, so I'll be watching for that.
NEUT6|But really, I'm just going to enjoy this week seeing what happens.
NEUT7|And at the end of the week.
NEUT8|Possibly over the weekend.
NEUT9|This next weekend we might get delivery numbers in January and I'm really excited to see what those are.
NEUT10|I know that they had set as a goal a target they want 7500 as the number for January, but after 7007 in December I'm hoping we see something closer to 8000, maybe even over 8000.
NEUT11|This is not only so that they will continue making monthly records, but also.
NEUT12|As they've said, they want to do 150,000 deliveries in 2021.
BULL13|This is the first month of the year and I would love to see him get off to a great start.
BULL14|A strong start.
NEUT15|They're going to need over 8000 I think.
NEUT16|If they want to kind of set the tone on this year so we've got exciting things ahead in the next couple of months.
BEAR17|We're going to see quarter 4 numbers released and folks, I'm telling you this is going to be a monster report.
BULL18|We're going to see some things that the pros aren't counting on aren't expecting, and I think it's going to be big news.
NEUT19|For the stock for the company, so I am hoping to secure more shares before then actually whom I can.
NEUT20|I'm going to buy more shares before then, I just want to lock in a good price and so I'll be looking for another point at which to buy.
NEUT21|But I also realize we may just see this thing start slowly continuing upwards, because frankly, I thought we should have been in the 60s a month or two ago.
NEUT22|So for me, most of these folks are still trailing us, but that's alright.
NEUT23|Will let him catch up and push our price along as we go forward folks.
NEUT24|This is a quick update.
NEUT25|I don't have a whole lot else that I want to share in this video because it's Sunday night.
BULL26|I'm just excited to get things going, so a quick shout out to Neo as we're getting ready for the week to start and what I expect and what I hope to see is some forward momentum upward trajectory with the stock price.
BULL27|Let's go Neil hey folks, thanks for watching.
NEUT28|Just make sure you seatbelts fastened 'cause if you're on this little thing, the Neo train with me.
NEUT29|You know we're going for ride.
NEUT30|"Thanks will talk to you again soon."""
