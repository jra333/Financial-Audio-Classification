BEAR0|"""Record contraction there in terms of factory activity much worse than expected, you're expecting nonetheless."
BULL1|A robust rebound commencing from the second quarter.
NEUT2|That's your baseline at the moment.
NEUT3|Would you be maybe rethinking that when you look at a number like this?
NEUT4|Well, I mean, I think it's directional.
NEUT5|So I mean, we saw over the weekend that we also had the fallen the official PMI as well.
BEAR6|So I mean we were expecting a terrible number.
BEAR7|There's no doubt about that, and in particular we're going to see some terrible numbers in some business surveys as well.
BEAR8|Real activity is also going to be weeks, so I think we're still on working on that working assumption that it will be short lived, but it's going to have a very high impact.
BEAR9|So as I mentioned earlier that Q1 GDP, I mean China at only two point 3% year on year, and that really is because of that manufacturing sector because of households and because of tourism as well, all impacting the economy.
NEUT10|Indeed, we're also seeing here in terms of some of the commentary, that there was a big backlog of previous orders, which I guess feeds into what Steven was talking about.
NEUT11|You know, we're looking at demand destruction or demand deferral, and if indeed there is this pent up demand, there is this backlog of orders which you know once things do start to get better, get unleashed into the market.
NEUT12|What kind of robust rebound would you expect?
NEUT13|How strong could it potentially be?
BULL14|You could be looking up at a close to 10% year on year in Q2.
NEUT15|So that is true.
BULL16|I mean, we do see some destruction that's bound to happen in this situation, but we there are a lot of this is actually deferral as well, so we're actually looking for a very strong rebounding growth going from Q2 into the second half of the year as well, Steven, would you agree?
NEUT17|Yeah, I'm one of the things I just want to ask Sean is policy responses, so we've obviously already seen the PBOC being accommodative.
NEUT18|They give much greater flexibility to the banking system in the terms of the way that they deal with bad loans in how they define those.
BULL19|We've obviously seen policy responses from other central banks.
NEUT20|Could it be a case that the worst the data of the more accommodative the policy response is going to be, and therefore the more supportive?
NEUT21|And, I think, definitely in China.
NEUT22|That's the case, and we've seen China being more sort of reacting to to data, and they're willing to show support, but they don't want to actually have a big bazooka or a fiscal or monetary policy.
BULL23|So I think we could will obviously see more things come into place in China for the rest of the region.
NEUT24|We don't see too many more interest rate cuts.
BULL25|We already think things are fairly accommodating.
BULL26|They're probably willing to cut rates more if it looks like it's going to be more prolonged going to Q2, but we're also seeing the fiscal side now we've seen for Singapore.
BULL27|We've also seen that for for Malaysia last week as well, and Hong Kong of course, and we're expecting more physical support from Thailand and career as well.
