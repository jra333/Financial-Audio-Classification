NEUT0|"""You don't need a lot of brains in this business."
NEUT1|I mean, I've always said if you got a IQ of 160, give away 30 points or somebody else 'cause you don't need it and investments.
NEUT2|What you do need is emotional stability.
NEUT3|You have to.
NEUT4|You have to be able to think independently and they have to be.
NEUT5|You have to be.
NEUT6|When you come to a conclusion, you have to really not care what other people say and and just follow the facts and follow your reasoning and and that's that's tough for a lot of people.
NEUT7|At that part, I think I was just lucky with that was born that way.
NEUT8|It never bothered me if people disagreed with what I thought.
NEUT9|As long as I felt I knew the facts.
NEUT10|I mean there's a whole bunch of things I don't know.
NEUT11|Nothing about it, I just stay away from those, so I stay within what I call my circle of competence.
NEUT12|You know that Tom Watson said it best.
NEUT13|He said, you know, he said, he said, I'm no genius but I'm smart in spots.
NEUT14|And I stay around those spots.
NEUT15|Well, I try and stay around those spots and I I just don't have a problem.
NEUT16|"If somebody says you know you're wrong on something, I just I go back and look at the facts and and I think that I think that really is much more important frankly than than having a few points of IQ or or having an extra course or two and in school or anything of the sort you need emotional stability."""
