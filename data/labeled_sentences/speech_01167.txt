NEUT0|"""Why trade forex?"
NEUT1|There are lots of ways to invest your money.
NEUT2|Lots of people buy stocks or bonds.
NEUT3|Lyrics.
NEUT4|The effects market has several advantages over the stock and bond markets.
NEUT5|First off, in stocks and bonds, you sometimes have a bull market when everything or just about everything is going up.
NEUT6|And of course you sometimes have a bear market when everything or just about everything is going down.
NEUT7|It's pretty easy to make money in a bull market, but it's a lot harder for an individual trader to make money in a bear market when prices are falling day after day.
NEUT8|In effects, though, there's never a bull market or a bear market, since each currency trade consists of buying one currency and selling another, the market never goes up or down as a whole.
NEUT9|One currency going down naturally means another currency relative to that going up.
NEUT10|All that matters is that you figure out whether the currency you're interested in is going up or is going down.
NEUT11|Secondly, the effects market is by and large a level playing field.
NEUT12|There are no mergers and acquisitions or insider trading to make the market move unexpectedly.
NEUT13|Some banks that get a lot of orders do have more information about what's going on in the market than say the average individual, but over a longer time horizon.
NEUT14|Economic and political fundamentals are what drive customer flows and everyone has equal access to information about those.
NEUT15|Besides affects is the biggest market in the world.
NEUT16|Some $5 trillion a day in trades.
NEUT17|Nobody is big enough to control a market of that size for long.
NEUT18|3rd the market trades 24 hours a day, five days a week.
NEUT19|You can start trading at 9:00 AM on Monday morning in Wellington, New Zealand and turn off your computer at 5:00 PM on Friday in San Francisco, US.
NEUT20|That is 124 hours straight of trading time.
NEUT21|It's hard for someone with a job to trade stocks because the markets only open while they're at work, but you can trade effects anytime before work after work or even on your way to work.
NEUT22|If you wake up in the middle of the night with a great idea, the market's waiting for you.
NEUT23|Trading FX is cheap.
NEUT24|Generally speaking, you trade directly with the market maker.
NEUT25|There's no Commission, no brokerage fees or no stamp duty, and because the market is so big, the odds are you'll never be stuck in a trade.
NEUT26|If you want to get out of a position, you can almost always find someone to buy or to sell with trades are executed within seconds.
NEUT27|You can get started with a little money.
NEUT28|In fact you can start with a demo account and no money at all.
NEUT29|And practice trading risk free.
NEUT30|And when you finally feel ready to challenge the market as little as $500 could get you started.
NEUT31|$500 won't get you that far in stock or bond markets, but in the FX market where you can use leverage, you can control a substantial amount of funds with that amount of money.
