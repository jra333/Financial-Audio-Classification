NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT2|Prince.
NEUT3|In this video we're going to discuss about Tonix Pharmaceuticals, holding and.
BULL4|Although there has been volatility in the last couple of weeks, but the way things have shaped up, we will definitely see some big things going forward.
NEUT5|And that's what we're going to discuss over here.
NEUT6|So if you're looking at this weekly chart, which is a long term chart in front of you, there is actually no sign of any outside weakness because it's been moving and moving inside a range bound trend, OK?
NEUT7|And right now, if you can see the stock is again started moving, even though it's looks more, but we're looking at the weekly chart, so.
NEUT8|No, what we're what we're going to expect something like this?
NEUT9|So on the downside, you have your support at $0.56 an on the upside you have your target or resistance at 2.6802 point $7.00, so this will be your first resistance at 2.7 dollar an unless the stock moves and sustain about 2.7 dollars.
NEUT10|You cannot expect anything on the outside, but if this is going to move.
NEUT11|On the upside.
BULL12|And sustain above 2.7 or more.
BULL13|In that case, we are expecting the stock to touch this, moving every line of 200 DMA.
NEUT14|So this is the bigger big one.
NEUT15|OK, and that will lead us to a price target of $13.00 in the weeks as well as in the months to come.
NEUT16|So these are the levels that we are considering for the time being, but $13.00 is a conditional.
NEUT17|For that the stock needs to sustain above 2.6 or 2.7, so let's see how the treadmill move going forward and then we will re analyze the chart accordingly.
NEUT18|So this is the end of the video.
