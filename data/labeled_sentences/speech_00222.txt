NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see actually during the past several months we have a high of one 137 and we have a secondary high of here is the 125.
NEUT2|And now we we have.
BULL3|Just past the consolidation for the last.
BEAR4|Wake we can see here for last week the price is very steady.
BEAR5|And the volume has been decreased, so it's a very healthy sign for the stock to to make consolidation here.
NEUT6|So the price.
NEUT7|No longer drop.
BULL8|And it's a very healthy sign for it to gain momentum.
NEUT9|And also if we change the chart.
BEAR10|In the weekly cut.
NEUT11|Then we can see here.
BULL12|After the uptrend we have made a.
NEUT13|Double bottom.
NEUT14|Consolidation here this is 1 bottom.
NEUT15|This is another bottle.
NEUT16|So last week we just have this green candle with a smaller volume compared to this one.
BULL17|So it means the consolidation is healthy.
NEUT18|No too much selling pressure.
NEUT19|And if we draw a line, we can see.
NEUT20|If we connect.
NEUT21|The low point.
NEUT22|Here.
NEUT23|And if we connect.
NEUT24|The high point here.
NEUT25|Then we can see it has formed a triangle pattern, so it's very likely for the Apple stock to break out.
NEUT26|From the upside, and then make a new high.
NEUT27|So in my opinion is very likely.
BULL28|"Thank you."""
