BULL0|"""What's up everyone, I hope you guys are having a great day and are making some money in the stock market today."
NEUT1|I'm actually a about 300 bucks right now, so I'm pretty happy about that, but I wanted to create this video today to talk a little bit about Amazon stock in honor of Amazon Prime Day.
NEUT2|So let's take a look at their stock chart and see where the price may be heading in the future.
BEAR3|So far in 2017, Amazon has been absolutely crushing it.
BULL4|Their stock started the year at about $750 and it's risen all the way up to $1000.
NEUT5|We actually featured this stock in our March 26th Investment Ideas newsletter and the reason why we included this stock in that newsletter is because of this tight little channel that formed through the month of March.
NEUT6|Usually what happens when a stock consolidates like this in a small range.
BULL7|There's typically a big breakout, either lower or higher, and Luckily Amazon was able to break out higher and continue that.
BEAR8|Run all the way up to $1000 before it ran into some volatility.
BULL9|If you think you missed out on the opportunity to invest in Amazon because it's, it's risen so much over the past couple of years.
NEUT10|Don't I mean, this company just has so much potential.
NEUT11|Let's take a look at the long term chart and you can see what an incredible run it's been on for last couple of years.
NEUT12|So this chart goes all the way back to 2014 and you could see the price of the stock was only about $300 then, and it's been on this steady uptrend for years.
BULL13|It's reached $1000, so it's up over 300% in just the last three years, which is incredible.
NEUT14|And like I said, I don't think this is the end as long as this uptrend is intact, I'm still going to be a buyer of Amazon.
