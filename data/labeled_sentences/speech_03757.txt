BULL0|"""Though she be but little, she is fierce."
NEUT1|One of my favorite mantra that dates back.
NEUT2|I think the first time I can remember it was when I was studying abroad in South Africa as a sophomore in college.
NEUT3|Was a quote from Shakespeare, though she be but little, she is fierce.
NEUT4|And every time some self doubt might creep in and say, well, you're just one person.
NEUT5|Yes, maybe you know the first woman are the youngest person to do it, or a first generation college student to do it.
NEUT6|But that doesn't make me small.
NEUT7|It just means that you know I have to harness the power that I have and and take that as an opportunity to be one person to create a meaningful difference.
NEUT8|So the person that has had the biggest influence on my life was my freshman political science professor.
NEUT9|I am first generation college students, so you know, going to college was nerve wracking for me.
NEUT10|Thinking you know how.
NEUT11|How am I going to perform?
NEUT12|Am I going to stack up to people that you know have more in the way of mentors and telling them how things function and how?
NEUT13|You know to take tests or how to study, so there is a lot of doubt.
NEUT14|And I was in a political science course with a renowned professor.
BULL15|I just really looked up to him and took in every word that he said and I really wanted to perform well.
NEUT16|He was also known as one of the hardest professors at the University, so I studied hard and I found out that I got the first perfect score and the only perfect score on this test out of the class.
NEUT17|100 and his name is Doctor de Clerico and Doctor de Clerico.
NEUT18|After the exam results were released, he said I want whoever got the 100 on my test to come up and speak to me.
NEUT19|So I came up after class and I was so nervous and my.
NEUT20|Palms were sweaty, and I said that was me Doctor Clerico and he said, well, I want to work with you.
NEUT21|I want to be your mentor and from then on I really took it everything he said and tried to just make him proud and everything that I did.
NEUT22|You know he really guided me through getting an internship with Congress, studying abroad, applying for law school, taking the challenging courses, and because he believed in me.
NEUT23|"I felt like I could do anything because someone that I looked up to so much was investing time in me because they knew I had potential meant the world."""
