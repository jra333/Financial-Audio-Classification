BULL0|"""Beyond meat topping the tape today, soaring about 18% after announcing a partnership with Pepsi to create and market new plant based snacks and drinks."
BULL1|Drinks beyond touching its highest level since July 2019.
NEUT2|In today's session, Karen up snacks and snacks like I get drinks.
NEUT3|I don't know, yeah.
NEUT4|I don't know, I mean so beyond meat.
NEUT5|I really do believe in this secular change.
NEUT6|Here the valuation is much harder to get around, but they've done a really good job of building partnerships and to their credit, because you know, even though one of the bear cases and it has been, what about competition?
NEUT7|There's so many others who could come in.
BEAR8|They have secured a lot of spots that it's going to be hard to dethrone them unless they really screw up so good for them.
BULL9|That's a big partnership.
NEUT10|I can't get close to valuation, I'm just I'm going to have to wait till Oatley comes out and see how that trades and.
NEUT11|I don't know, maybe there's value there, but good for beyond me.
NEUT12|Ethan brownstone.
BULL13|Tremendous job.
NEUT14|I mean totally is plant based, but it's made out of oats.
NEUT15|Beyond meat makes fake meat.
NEUT16|I don't know how you turn that into a drink of some.
NEUT17|My head is still trying to understand this guy.
NEUT18|I don't know.
NEUT19|I mean, I could imagine alternative meat jerky, maybe, but a drink now you really on a night where we have a 2 hour show, you really shouldn't plant that seed.
NEUT20|In my head, it's just not particularly Fairview number 1 #2.
NEUT21|If you do recall, ever since the taste test we did for beyond meat I've said listen, this is not my Cup of tea in terms of product, but I love the stock and here we are separated into 221 today.
BULL22|That's a good news.
NEUT23|The bad news?
NEUT24|If you're looking for some, it traded almost 10 times normal volume closed around 190 or so, which is right about those previous double tops from July of last year in October.
NEUT25|I think you got to stay with it, 'cause with Pepsi's distribution network and probably more deals to come, you're going to see moves like this again, but it does make sense if you've been in the name.
NEUT26|Just sort of pare some risk down and look for a re entry point, alright?
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
