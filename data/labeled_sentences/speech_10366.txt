NEUT0|"""However, let's take out the Apple stock."
BULL1|As we can see here, it has made a right kind of District Council seat above the year.
NEUT2|My line.
NEUT3|So in short term is still constructive, but actually we change chart into weekly chart will see a big picture that here is very likely to form a Cup and handle pattern because we can see here is the Cup and handle has already formed here.
NEUT4|So if we can keep above, this line is very likely.
BULL5|For Apple to go higher further because the Cup has been formed in the past.
NEUT6|Several months we can see here, so actually it begin at the early November, early September and then.
NEUT7|If we draw a line here, we can see the Cup body has been finalized in at the end of December, and this is the handle break out.
BULL8|So it's very likely for it to go higher from here.
BULL9|"Thank you."""
