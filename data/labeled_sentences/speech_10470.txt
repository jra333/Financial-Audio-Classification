NEUT0|"""Trying to do a strategize betting on a decline so that people are not going to pay up."
BEAR1|You know, I hate it when people pay up in the mornings when we work together.
NEUT2|I think healthcare goes down no matter who is elected to really go down.
NEUT3|If Biden is elected but it also down, you know Trump is saying he wants lower prices.
NEUT4|No one ever succeeds in getting getting their way when it comes to health care.
NEUT5|The American people always pay more so in that sense, what I want to do is do Centene, which is a health care company that if Biden wins, they do great.
NEUT6|They do all the.
BULL7|Obamacare states, but they also have had had a great run here.
BULL8|Just great run.
NEUT9|It's very inexpensive Thermo Fisher.
NEUT10|Why?
NEUT11|Because test test test.
NEUT12|There are the makers of PCR.
NEUT13|I had him on tonight.
NEUT14|There's going to be the best quarter.
NEUT15|I know.
NEUT16|It's $5 to feel bad by 1/10 of it.
NEUT17|Whatever you can do.
NEUT18|Bristol Myers.
NEUT19|Why?
NEUT20|Because again, I like dividend.
NEUT21|I like safety.
NEUT22|I don't want anyone to get hurt.
NEUT23|Carl do first do no harm and then regenerx on an interesting choice.
NEUT24|Saved the president's life.
NEUT25|Some people say.
NEUT26|But if the federal government were to start taking control of the anti covid fight.
NEUT27|I think they go with their general and so when we put up 10 plants you think the balance of the names you're talking about depends more on who's in the White House or who controls Congress, Congress, and but I, I think that the reason I did this, I don't necessarily know who's gonna be best, but these stocks go down and then Congress protects them.
NEUT28|That's the people.
NEUT29|Get scared.
NEUT30|People think that this has been going on since 1992.
NEUT31|People think that the president is going to go after whoever it is is going to try to get the price of health care down.
NEUT32|All seniors want it lower.
BEAR33|We all want healthcare lower and they always fail because of Congress.
NEUT34|So you take the initial knee jerk sell and you buy these stocks.
NEUT35|I don't wanna give you some stockings.
BULL36|Could be up already taken by Apple and Apple could be up with the futures get up.
BEAR37|These are stocks that will be down and that's where opportunities and relative to other sectors that are under some kind of regulatory scrutiny.
NEUT38|Where would you place healthcare right now versus say tech?
NEUT39|I think that tech is a lot of bluster.
NEUT40|They don't know what to do.
NEUT41|They were going to break up tech.
NEUT42|I mean Google put out some numbers and alphabet.
BULL43|They gave you some great segment numbers and I said, oh man, Justice Department hold the by.
NEUT44|You know, I felt that just apartment could be your best friend there.
NEUT45|These I picked because I'm so tired of people getting hurt.
NEUT46|I wanted to pick stocks that I expect will be down.
NEUT47|And you know, look if you look at history, Cramer's, a big jerk public like.
NEUT48|Yeah, I've been at jerk since I came since February 10, not give it to five.
NEUT49|But I would say that all these things are.
BEAR50|I think it will be under under pressure from both.
NEUT51|And that's when you buy.
BEAR52|I don't like the up 500.
NEUT53|That's how people get hurt generally.
NEUT54|True Jim.
BULL55|Yeah, good stuff buddy.
NEUT56|Thank you.
NEUT57|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT58|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
