BULL0|"""Super props to Mike because you've been a Bitcoin bull for awhile."
BULL1|Very solidly with your point.
NEUT2|How much more upside in the short term, though is there short term 20,000 is pretty good resistance I'm afraid.
BEAR3|It's probably going to wet.
NEUT4|What goal did it got to 2000 and then that's been consolidating bull market since.
NEUT5|But the key thing about Bitcoin this year is it's very simple.
NEUT6|It just added a one to the front of the number memory was around 7000, the end of last year.
NEUT7|What I'm worried about if you look at the past performance is potentially indicative of the future next year too.
BEAR8|It could add a zero to the back of the number.
NEUT9|Well.
NEUT10|OK, so those are some pretty big numbers.
NEUT11|Why why?
NEUT12|We moved on from this?
NEUT13|Just being?
NEUT14|I'm going to get emails I suspect about this.
NEUT15|The Greater fool theory I I'm.
NEUT16|I'm still trying to wonder what problem Bitcoin is.
NEUT17|Bitcoin solves.
NEUT18|Bitcoin is becoming a digital version of Gold Guy.
NEUT19|One key point that's happening this year.
BEAR20|It's Bitcoin volatility has been declining.
BEAR21|In fact it's the lowest ever versus gold.
BEAR22|It's lower than 180 day volatility on Bitcoin versus NASDAQ is actually below that in NASDAQ, so every other risks ask it on the planet Vault.
BEAR23|Have been increasing bitcoins been declining?
NEUT24|And what's happening with QE?
NEUT25|We all know there's limited supply Bitcoin it's becoming before was institutional form.
NEUT26|It was, you know, it was retail form and now it's becoming institutional formal in limited supply and demand is picking up in the macros very positive.
NEUT27|So what does it move with?
NEUT28|So gold usually has an inverse correlation with the dollar.
NEUT29|For example, what is Bitcoin actually moved with demand?
NEUT30|And that's a key thing.
NEUT31|Well, it's it's highly correlated.
NEUT32|These risk on dollar?
NEUT33|Well, it's it's.
BULL34|It has been this year most highly correlated to gold.
NEUT35|Before it was the equities.
NEUT36|That's kind of transitioning.
NEUT37|The NASDAQ couldn't get above 12,000 bitcoins breaking out, but going forward.
NEUT38|It's honestly, I say that sarcastically, but it's true.
NEUT39|All that matters is demand.
BEAR40|Because supplies limited, there's only gonna be 21 million next year.
BEAR41|"Supply is going to drop below 2% annually, and by the time we get to 2024, the next having this can be 1%."""
