NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will say I'll be talking about AMC Entertainment stock are AMC stock and I'm giving my MC stock predictions and my MC stock analysts.
NEUT3|OK so make sure you like the video that subscribe button.

NEUT5|So as this jumped up right, how much percentage was this?
BULL6|This jumped up all the way to over 300%, right?
NEUT7|So this made me interested in the stock as you guys know, I look for 100% place or more.
NEUT8|I don't like anything below 100% place so as it was coming here, I was very interested and I saw this level as a buying opportunity.
BEAR9|And it was coming down.
NEUT10|I was getting very excited.
BEAR11|It came down to about 6.5 and my level was at 5.16.
NEUT12|So it just came a dollar shy, right?
NEUT13|Just came a dollar shy I should've just bought anyway but it didn't hit it.
NEUT14|I usually like to be precise so it didn't hit it so I waited and now it's up $11.00 right?
BULL15|So it came real close.
BEAR16|I'm thinking there's too much of buying pressure for it to come down here so this is very bullish that it didn't hit it.
NEUT17|But if it would hit it, that's when I'm going to block.
NEUT18|So I don't see you really any resistance, but if it gets above.
NEUT19|I will say if it starts going above like 1213, you could probably see it 1617 and then if it goes above 20 then the stock will probably just rock it.
NEUT20|But if it does come back down here, I will buy like 1%.
NEUT21|I put 1% my folio at this level to look for higher prices, but if it breaks it then I just won't be watching it.
NEUT22|Then I'll just be waiting for a new level to come in and see if the stock still has some pressure on it, OK?
BEAR23|So as a job came out I was waiting for a pullback.
NEUT24|That's why I had this level right here, right?
NEUT25|I didn't want to buy up here in high prices.
NEUT26|'cause you gotta remember, this stock was at $4.00.
NEUT27|So you really don't want to be buying at $20?
NEUT28|'cause that's a huge premium that you're paying.
NEUT29|That's over 300% more you're paying for the stock for the people that paid it, bought it down here so you want to wait for a pullback right?
NEUT30|Stocks always have that pull back, so even this day when it opened up and it pulled back, you could have bought at that pull back right?
NEUT31|And you could have still made.
BULL32|Probably still over 100%.
NEUT33|Oh, 65% right?
NEUT34|So you could still make 65% on your money if you just waited for the pullback, right?
NEUT35|So this pullback I wanted to come down here.
BEAR36|I didn't quite get there, but we will see tomorrow if it hits it I will be buying but it starts going up.
NEUT37|I will wait to see how prices moving to see if I can find an entry.
NEUT38|OK this time playing AMC stock makes you guys be careful on this one.
NEUT39|And remember another recommendation about anything.
NEUT40|This educational purposes only.
