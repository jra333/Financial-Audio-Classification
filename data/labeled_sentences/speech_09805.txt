BULL0|"""Guys GameStop took a huge win today."
BULL1|We at one point were up 50%.
BULL2|That is amazing.
NEUT3|And honestly I don't know about you guys but that makes me so excited.
NEUT4|Yo.
NEUT5|What is up everyone it's your boy thievin here from market craze trading.
BULL6|I hope everyone had a fantastic day today.
NEUT7|If you're new here on the channel, welcome to the channel.
NEUT8|If you're returning member, welcome back.
NEUT9|Alright, so today we're obviously going to talk about GameStop.
NEUT10|It's one of the hottest stocks out right now.
NEUT11|Is going up and down and up and down and up and down after a whole week.
NEUT12|Of an absolute surge to the moon in the question on everyone's mind right now is are we actually going to see the stock go to the moon or is it over for this stock?
NEUT13|I'm going to answer that question today in this video, but before I get into that, make sure you guys go down below.
NEUT14|Hit that red subscribe button like it owes you money and slap that notification Bell.
NEUT15|Now with that out of the way, let's get into this.
BULL16|So yeah, I think GameStop is on a way up back to the moon.
BULL17|Is looking really good for GameStop now as we all know by now.
NEUT18|GameStop was.
BEAR19|Under attack by the hedge funds in Wall Street, whenever they took GameStop and AMC right off of Robin Hood, not to mention the other companies that they also took off Robin Hood that weren't even involved at the time they took a lot of companies off of Robin Hood that weren't even involved.
NEUT20|At one point they took CC Ivy.
NEUT21|Often they limited the shares that you could buy in the trades that you could make.
BEAR22|It was all just very weird.
NEUT23|So as we can see that was Robin Hood and Aphex and all these other clearing firms.
NEUT24|That we're trying to get us to back down and it does not seem like it's working.
NEUT25|It worked somewhat.
NEUT26|It scared all of these smaller investors, but the ones that are here for the long haul and are here with Diamond hands will be staying.
BULL27|GameStop is going to be a very bumpy Rd like one of the roads that is not even close to finished yet, but it is going to be a very rewarding Rd.
NEUT28|I'm not a financial advisor by any means, but I'm personally going to be holding.
NEUT29|It's going to be really interesting to see how GameStop plays out next week.
NEUT30|I think next week is going to be a huge week for all of the Wall Street bets.
NEUT31|In meme stocks as people like to call it a lot of people think that oh, this is over with now, but I think that this has not even begun.
BEAR32|I was singing the other day that GameStop and AMC work done and then I saw the volatility as of today.
NEUT33|And Oh my gosh, it blew my mind after Robin Hood just just let go all the restrictions.
BEAR34|Robin we can't keep us down guys.
NEUT35|They just can't.
NEUT36|But anyway guys I'd love to know what you guys think about this stock.
NEUT37|In what it could look like in the next couple of days or in the next week?
NEUT38|I guess I'd love to know what you guys think about it.
NEUT39|This is my price prediction for Monday.
BULL40|I think GameStop will be around $90.00 on Monday if not 100 an I think that this stock is going to start slowly climbing back up.
BEAR41|Anyway guys, I hope you guys didn't do this video.
