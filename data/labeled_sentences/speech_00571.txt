NEUT1|I think we're going to have a big move on it.
BULL2|One you can see how the 21 moving average has just crossed about above the 2:33, so that's a good signal.
NEUT3|And the price is just above the 233.
NEUT4|Also if we go over here to magenta and take a look at the cloud, you can see how we have a bullish cloud.
NEUT5|The chikou span is above the candles and the tech in line is above the occasion.
BULL6|And we got above the price here, so we're looking for a big up move here.
NEUT7|On serious, so I'm going to play.
NEUT8|Here, let's take a look at these strikes.
NEUT9|And on CRUS, and I like their November.
BEAR10|Sorry, their November 22nd here.
