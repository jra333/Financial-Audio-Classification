NEUT0|"""Joining us in a CNBC exclusive interview, Certara CEO William Fury William."
BULL1|Congratulations great to have you.
NEUT2|Thank you.
BULL3|It's really great to be here today.
BULL4|We're very excited.
BULL5|We yeah nice opening trade.
NEUT6|We mentioned the COVID-19 backlog you're working with the Gates Foundation accelerator.
NEUT7|I mean it's kind of hard to imagine a better dovetailing of market timing and industry dynamics.
NEUT8|You know, I think you know the facts that are's been around for over 20 years.
BULL9|We've been working.
BULL10|We've been working with over 1600 customers worldwide.
NEUT11|We built a nice, profitable growing business that delivers bias simulation technologies, really changing the way that drug development is done in the world is really what excites us.
BULL12|And we're just so proud to be at this point where we've met this in tile, this public company milestone.
NEUT13|Looking in looking at the the company profile, the term bio simulation comes up a lot.
NEUT14|Is there a way to break that down and decompose it to where the layperson could understand?
NEUT15|Yeah, you know what we do with bias simulation is we have a computer model of what the drug will do in a human body, and so how it's absorbed or metabolised and how it interacts with the target.
NEUT16|And we can also model what happens across large populations of people that a drug might encounter when or will encounter when it's put on the market.
BULL17|So by doing that you know we can provide a lot of information during drug development that helps helps design clinical trials more efficiently.
NEUT18|It helps inform the safety and the effectiveness.
NEUT19|Of a drug, and we find that this has been this has been used more and more by the Pharmaceutical industry throughout history.
NEUT20|You know right now.
BULL21|Over 90% of new drugs approved by the FDA since 2014 have been to surcharge customers, so we're really, really proud of that.
NEUT22|I wonder what the use case is in situations like we find ourselves in now.
NEUT23|We're looking at this Pfizer vaccine that some people are having allergic reactions to.
NEUT24|I think if you guys maybe like an Autodesk for biology, are you able to account for the variations in human biology?
NEUT25|And figure out why there are different reactions in cases like this.
NEUT26|Yeah, that's that's a great point.
NEUT27|So one of the key features of our software is the ability to simulate what's likely to happen with the drug in different types, different different populations of people.
NEUT28|Obviously I can't comment on any individual project, but you know, some of the some of what we're seeing here would be absolutely, really excellent use cases for our software and our technology.
NEUT29|So then what would you say are the accelerants to the effectiveness of your technology overtime?
NEUT30|Is it technologies like supercomputing like cloud computing that allow for more calculations to be to be done for less expense?
BULL31|You know the key to improving our technology is really, you know, we've benefited a lot from the just massive improvements in the understanding.
NEUT32|The underlying biology and we're always informing and validating our technology by more and more clinical data that comes out of the Pharmaceutical industry.
NEUT33|So that experience space is really important.
NEUT34|And that's become really, really important, As for example, as regulators.
NEUT35|Think about our technology.
NEUT36|So the one one of the I think interesting features about our technology is that regulators around the world, including the FDA, have been using it for a long time in questions that they ask about.
NEUT37|You know, data that are submitted to them.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
