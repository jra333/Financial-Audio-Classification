BEAR0|"""Hey guys, what's up?"
NEUT1|And welcome to the channel, my name Sean and I make videos about personal finance and investing in the stock market.
NEUT2|If you're into that, please consider sticking around and hitting that like button and without further ado, let's get right into it.
NEUT3|This video is about my three favorite dividend stocks, but before we jump right into that, just remember that I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT4|I'm just your friend.
BULL5|First off, everybody, I hope you all had a fantastic day.
NEUT6|Listen before we go head first into dividends.
NEUT7|It's important that you know what a dividend is.
NEUT8|It's basically a return on your investment given back to you, either annually, quarterly or monthly.
NEUT9|Rather than pay capital gains taxes on profits made from shareholder money, some companies would rather return those profits to their investors.
BULL10|It's also a great way of enticing investors to come and invest in that stock.
NEUT11|Now.
NEUT12|Generally speaking, dividend stocks aren't huge movers and they're probably not going to make you rich overnight, but they are their own little money making machine within the world's greatest.
NEUT13|Money making machine.
NEUT14|What I mean by this is you can use your dividend returns to buy more stocks.
NEUT15|Even set up a dividend reimbursement plan or drip to automatically reimburse your dividend stocks right back into your dividend play.
NEUT16|OK, you guys.
NEUT17|So my first favorite dividend stock is ticker symbol Ko Coca Cola not only in my addicted to Doctor Pepper, but Coca Cola pays you a quarterly dividend of over 3% on your investment.
BEAR18|Coca Cola is a powerhouse, in my opinion, stunted, maybe only by some of these lockdowns.
NEUT19|It's trading under $50 right now at a discount.
NEUT20|My next favorite dividend stock is ticker symbol BAC, Bank of America rating around $31 right now.
NEUT21|You guys Bank of America is a household name.
NEUT22|It happens to be one of the banks that I bank with and it's actually a bank that associates with Meryl Lynch where I have my Roth account.
NEUT23|There are also not Wells Fargo Bank of America pays a 2.4%.
NEUT24|Quarterly dividend back to all their investors.
NEUT25|Lastly, my very favorite dividend stock is ticker symbol, MAIN Main St Capital Maine pays a monthly dividend of $0.20 per share.
NEUT26|Now men makes most of their money by loaning money to other companies and they've loaned money to over 180 companies in over 50 different sectors.
BULL27|That's a lot of diversification that should hedge against any uncertainty for businesses.
NEUT28|During all these closures and whatnot.
BULL29|Maine is a great play in my opinion, in a particularly gratifying dividend stock.
NEUT30|That's it for today.
BULL31|You guys and I sincerely appreciate you sticking around.
