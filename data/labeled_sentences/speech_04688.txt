NEUT0|"""We're back, let's talk Disney Pete."
NEUT1|I'm looking to you.
NEUT2|You own it.
BULL3|OK, you got a bullish call today on the on the back of that reorg that the company announced yesterday.
BULL4|CEO Chapeco, tilting the scale towards the direct to consumer business.
NEUT5|You like to smooth.
NEUT6|I do an.
NEUT7|It's something to Dan Loeb talked about to write Scott.
NEUT8|I mean we we had this conversation just last week.
NEUT9|We were talking about that and he was discussing.
BEAR10|I think it was him that was discussing the idea of cutting the dividend permanently to search finance.
NEUT11|This thing I don't think you need to and my disagreement was only on that aspect of it.
NEUT12|Other than that I think streaming has been the place to be.
NEUT13|It was the only thing that I was ever critical about with Tiger was the move towards streaming because it was there in front of them and maybe it was Netflix.
NEUT14|Maybe it was whatever.
NEUT15|Well that doesn't matter anymore because they have moved Scott.
NEUT16|And they've moved at the right time and we certainly are seeing exactly what their game plan is going forward.
NEUT17|It's content, it's DTC and it's getting it out there.
NEUT18|Not just here but internationally, and I think this is something that makes total sense for Disney going forward.
NEUT19|And I I've been in the stock a long long period of time.
NEUT20|I mostly went to Kohl's recently just to trade around it, but I do think this is a reason for me to start saying you know what this could be again, another long term.
NEUT21|Hold stock went from 1:50 to 95.
NEUT22|Now here it is where it is right now.
BULL23|"I think there's going to be plenty of more upside in the future."""
