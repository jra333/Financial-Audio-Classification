NEUT0|"""As we get closer to a vaccine, this markets increasingly dominated by one question."
NEUT1|What's the post Covid future going to look like after day we had some natural property gets that big rally yesterday.
BEAR2|Well, we had the Dow dipping 131 points SNP backsliding .48% now is that catching down just .29%?
NEUT3|This is a good moment to consider where we will be in six months 'cause it's controlling.
NEUT4|A lot of the action we see in the stock market.
NEUT5|So the question is, will we go back to the old normal once the pandemic is over, or will some aspects of the new normal remain?
NEUT6|I think many of these changes will be ephemeral, but some could be permanent, real ingrained habits and right now Wall Street trying to guess which is which.
NEUT7|Remember the markets of forecasting machine that reflects expectations about the future much more than facts about the present.
NEUT8|That's why I always say we don't care where stocks have been, we care where they're going.
NEUT9|So what's the market saying but the post pandemic economy?
NEUT10|Well, let's start with the obvious one that many missed Palatine.
NEUT11|I'm getting right to it.
NEUT12|It's incredible how many smart people bet against this maker.
NEUT13|Smart exercise machines.
NEUT14|When Covid first hit money, managers quickly figured out that their gyms and their spin spin classes we could put.
BEAR15|But a lot of short sellers still tried to crush Palatine holding in the 30s.
NEUT16|Assuming it was just a stationary bike without videos, quite as time went on the gym chain after gym chain filed for bankruptcy.
NEUT17|Final straw two weeks ago.
NEUT18|Flywheel, bankruptcy and Pelham stock has soared to the stratosphere.
BULL19|The company is truly here to stay and it's expanding so offerings to ensure the competition stays dead.
NEUT20|I actually know people who got in early when they still had a lot of inventory and they brag about it.
NEUT21|Why not not anymore the verdict?
NEUT22|The market screaming that peloton is the real deal?
NEUT23|Next up, the Pandemic store to whole new generation.
NEUT24|How to cook it on because it's not really safe to dine out.
BULL25|You think that would mean great things for the packaged food companies and they're absolutely putting up fantastic numbers.
BEAR26|But the stocks keep getting clobbered because the market thinks they have no post pandemic staying power that we're just going to go out like we used to witness today's beat down with McCormack.
NEUT27|The spice maker that will hear about later tonight.
NEUT28|Do you know that investors made the same judgment about Campbell Soup?
NEUT29|We had them on to somehow, though, somehow get this.
NEUT30|Those same investors like the web digitization.
NEUT31|They believe that Pinterest, the virtual Pinboard platform, that's full of recipes is totally real.
BEAR32|I think the markets making a little bit misjudgement here.
BEAR33|We shouldn't be riding with the food stocks.
NEUT34|When Campbells works out the supply chain, I bent the bars will come back, the cash flows you just for McCormick.
NEUT35|They're still not getting enough credit from Franks hot sauce, let alone frenches mustard.
NEUT36|More on that later.
NEUT37|But that's just my opinion though.
NEUT38|The markets have paint the package through players.
NEUT39|No staying power.
