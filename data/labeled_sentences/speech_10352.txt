NEUT0|"""Jim, over the weekend a lot of discussion about how this stimulus package is shaping up big phone call with the White House and some senators."
BULL1|Ron Klain talked about how big Biden will be able to go in this era where bipartisanship is challenged.
NEUT2|Listen.
NEUT3|We're reaching out to people.
NEUT4|I don't think bipartisanship and speed are enemies of one another.
NEUT5|The need is urgent Americans.
BEAR6|Both Democrats and Republicans are dying kids.
BEAR7|Schools that take care of both Democratic and Republican kids are closed.
BEAR8|People are on unemployment, people are in food lines.
NEUT9|That's not a party issue.
NEUT10|So I think let's try to move on a bipartisan basis.
NEUT11|Let's try to move quickly.
NEUT12|Speed is very important here.
NEUT13|Chuck.
NEUT14|Are you willing, for instance, to table your push for.
NEUT15|Upping the minimum wage if it got you.
NEUT16|The ten Republicans you needed and you got everything else.
NEUT17|We're very dedicated to passing the minimum wage.
NEUT18|We think that's an urgent priority.
NEUT19|We're going to push the Congress to pass our priorities, and that includes the minimum wage.
NEUT20|And So what we want to do is work with the Congress.
NEUT21|Reach out to members in both parties, see what we can get done as quickly as possible.
BULL22|We certainly think the minimum wage should be part of this urgent relief package.
BEAR23|Jim Goldman's view is that we're going to settle somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.1 trillion, but it's kind of jarring to hear claim talk about real economic need in this country, even as we see new highs on the Nas.
BULL24|Yeah, I think that the separation of the two economies is pretty apparent.
NEUT25|This stock economies people who have jobs or took the they took their little benefit and put it to work.
NEUT26|Which is fine, because what else did they bath invest?
NEUT27|They could do cash, or they can do.
NEUT28|Stocks they seem to be liking stocks.
NEUT29|Ron Klain is a different kind of chief of staff.
NEUT30|Ron Klain put people who followed him for years.
NEUT31|Is is a technician, meaning that he's not ideological and the previous administration.
NEUT32|You had ideologues.
NEUT33|I think claim can get a deal done simply because his style, David.
NEUT34|His style is not in your face.
NEUT35|As this administration is not in your face.
NEUT36|No, nor they in your on your Twitter feed.
NEUT37|No, no, they're not different.
NEUT38|And you think that does what?
BULL39|I think that brings a little more calm.
NEUT40|No finger poking Siston see right?
NEUT41|I once tried to demonstrate that the president's callings the speaker needs or somehow came out that I did.
NEUT42|She's I've known her for years, is like kind of crazy.
NEUT43|Apologize to her.
NEUT44|I mean, I, I think she doesn't.
NEUT45|Very good job I. I felt like I just didn't do it right, but that idea of these different names for people in the Democratic Party.
NEUT46|That's a dumb thing.
BEAR47|And that hurt the case of trying to get something done by Secretary Manoosh.
NEUT48|And that's not happening here.
NEUT49|Ron Klain wants to try to get some sort of thing going.
NEUT50|And do it in a way that appeals to everybody.
BEAR51|I know, Carl, that's out of fashion or certainly wasn't the way of President Trump.
NEUT52|But I think it's going to be more successful because what it is is, hey, listen everybody.
BEAR53|The country is in trouble.
NEUT54|Let's get together now.
BEAR55|You could argue that the country is not in trouble, just the people are out of work.
NEUT56|But aren't those people look part of the country?
NEUT57|It doesn't matter.
NEUT58|Red State, blue state.
NEUT59|Their part of the country.
NEUT60|And that's what I think claims bringing to the party.
NEUT61|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT62|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
