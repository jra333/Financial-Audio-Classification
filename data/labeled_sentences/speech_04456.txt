NEUT0|"""What is wrong with the hold the line strategy?"
NEUT1|Simple can only go so far.
NEUT2|Right now there are just two stocks that are being kept higher.
BULL3|GameStop at AMC Gamestops buoyed by the Hope that a new board member can shake things up.
BULL4|Certainly enough to justify the stocks 9% boot and season 4% and maintain maintaining altitude based on a belief that the short sellers have to be wrong and the stock can rally full.
NEUT5|It's because it's the last movie theaters standing.
NEUT6|However, the last two business days.
BULL7|Both AMC and GameStop have made expanding moves to issue new stock, so they can raise cash.
NEUT8|The forms of short bouncing.
NEUT9|The latter wants to give management more firepower to turn things around, and she's looking for authorization to sell 500,000,000 shares or $5 billion with the stock down, they most likely won't use that.
NEUT10|They not the full amount that.
NEUT11|Would that be wrong, but at least CEO Adam Aron's taking big and want to ask permission again if he wants to go back to the well, he can be ready for any spike in the stock sell.
BEAR12|Or drop in attendance will raise money, Gamestop's only offering less than a billion dollars with the stock and doing so at the market, not in a block, in part because they don't want to share price.
NEUT13|Now I immediately when I read about both these well Adam Digital Mob, he did it on squawk on the street, but I applauded these moves.
NEUT14|ANSI is some very expensive deck that I really really don't like.
NEUT15|And an American buyback.
BULL16|Huge discount, something would give its earnings a huge boost even if you count some delusion.
BULL17|Aaron told me that he can use these shares to help beat the short sellers who played havoc with the stock GameStop.
NEUT18|Once the money to give us some more options, he looked the future scream for brick and mortar video game retailers, right?
NEUT19|So they either need to make an acquisition to change their stripes, or maybe they they try something totally new.
NEUT20|Maybe Gaming Palace is filled with E Sports players who are competing for cryptocurrency.
NEUT21|If you care about the future of either company or the long term trajectory of their stocks, issuing shares up here is the right move.
BEAR22|But the hold line crowd they hate these offerings.
BEAR23|Oh boy, they despise anyone who defends them the way they see it.
BEAR24|The companies are stabbing him in the back and siding with the short sellers wrong.
BEAR25|That is totally wrong.
NEUT26|Am seeing GameStop need money.
BULL27|Raising capital is good for both companies and over the long haul.
NEUT28|What's good for the company should be good for the stock.
BEAR29|Believe me, none of these executives wants to see their shares to go lower, but thanks to the paranoid style of American investing, anyone in defense these losers getting raked over the coals on social media.
