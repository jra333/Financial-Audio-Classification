NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, it's Dave Aquino with base camp trading and this is the free video for Monday June 3rd, 2019."
BEAR1|So we've seen pretty significant weakness here in Amazon today.
BULL2|You can see that we are following through based on Friday's weakness.
BEAR3|We opened below the previous days close and we came down and quickly broke the 200 day simple moving average which is sitting at $1753.16.
BEAR4|We broke that and we actually fell all the way to the low of the day is $1679.19.
BEAR5|This is a pretty significant down move.
BEAR6|You can see Amazon is close to the low of the day we are down.
BEAR7|Over 5% ninety points and the daily momentum is very weak.
NEUT8|Now the question is, now we know which direction we're going in, how far could it possibly drop?
BEAR9|I think it's reasonable to expect the market in Amazon to continue to fall all the way down to the roughly the 1650 level and actually pushed below it just a little bit more to 1637 and 30 cents roughly that right.
NEUT10|That area around 1637.
NEUT11|Now I'd arrived at Target as a from the 50% retracement, the Fibbonaci retracement all the way from the low of of December 21st.
NEUT12|I'm sorry December 24th of last year all the way to the high of May 3rd and we're looking at a 50% retracement to 1637.
BULL13|Now you will start encountering some support because there's a lot of congestion right around 1640 to 1625.
NEUT14|This area is a lot of previous trading going into the very beginning of the year before we broke higher.
BULL15|So on the way down, this area should provide a lot of resistance to Amazon falling any further.
NEUT16|The scary thing is, and this kind of move is will.
BEAR17|Take your breath away again down over 91 points a little bit over 5% just today.
