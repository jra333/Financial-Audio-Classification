NEUT0|"""I have one more question for you here."
NEUT1|In just a bit about as we partner with active operators in the US, We are boots on the ground, so locating and picking the cities and regions we want to be in is at the core of of our business and we're open minded.
NEUT2|Of course we follow the numbers so it may look very interested to know your top pick for multifamily assets.
NEUT3|As far as the city and the state.
NEUT4|I mean, you know, I think you mentioned this city as far as Ohio.
NEUT5|I believe it was.
NEUT6|It was a city in Ohio, but as far as this this this state.
NEUT7|Yeah and that will happen if you can speak of it.
NEUT8|Maybe not just the only top city, but maybe the top three.
NEUT9|Yeah, I think if Neil Bow is bullish about a city, that's where we want to be.
NEUT10|Well, I'll give you those an I will point you to a presentation where I only talk about the top cities in, in, in, in, in this, you know, in a particular year the presentations done in Jen, and I'll share again for a second so you can see it.
NEUT11|Here we go.
NEUT12|So it's called real estate.
NEUT13|2021 trends, it it?
NEUT14|It's a very wide ranging presentation.
NEUT15|You can watch it on multifamilyu.com.
NEUT16|But here's my answer to the question.
NEUT17|It's a very specific question and I have a very, very specific answer, and so my favorite cities four 2021 for investing.
NEUT18|And let's see if I can click on this.
NEUT19|No.
NEUT20|Nope, Nope, Nope, no.
NEUT21|I'm not one thing I want to mention here is all the websites that Neil mentioned were all free website and all the information he's providing is is is not paid.
NEUT22|So this is not a plug where someone is coming in and trying to sell something.
NEUT23|And that's what the incredible thing about it is like saying.
NEUT24|Learn so much from the man so just want to appreciate that point.
NEUT25|Thank you.
BULL26|Thank you amongst small cities in the US.
NEUT27|The best one, which is actually fairly close to you guys is Idaho Falls.
NEUT28|You can get to Idaho Falls from multiple places in the US, multiple places in Canada as well, because it's it's kind of fairly closed.
NEUT29|That's on the northern side.
NEUT30|Why I don't fault, it's it's really the only city that grew in 2020.
BEAR31|Incredible numbers, just insane numbers during the pandemic.
BULL32|A lot of growth because of its nuclear facilities.
BULL33|Nuclear is now growing again in the US.
NEUT34|Other cities that I like and I actually have my own picks here here.
NEUT35|Take a look under performing and best markets.
NEUT36|Well, my pick for underperforming market is Indianapolis and for best Market is Phoenix.
NEUT37|Phoenix is expensive so I suggest that you look 30 or 40 miles outside Phoenix.
NEUT38|So the Metro itself is very strong but maybe like 30 or 40 miles out and you'll see some Buckeye.
NEUT39|For example is 44 miles out and I think is a is an interesting city to.
NEUT40|Look at.
NEUT41|Phoenix Metro is my top pick.
NEUT42|Indianapolis is what we call the up and coming market.
BEAR43|Indianapolis does not qualify on the crime basis though its crime is dropping.
NEUT44|So what I suggest is when you're looking at Indy, just be extra careful about crime.
NEUT45|So those are those are some of my favorite markets.
NEUT46|The presentation goes on and talks about multifamily and single family market.
NEUT47|I'm going to skip past all of these so you notice here I've got pages and pages of markets.
NEUT48|Ann, really what's important is context, right?
NEUT49|So watch the presentation.
NEUT50|I'll give you context on why convene Texas, a very small city of 100 and 46,000 people is a is a terrific city to invest.
BULL51|"Amazing, incredible."""
