NEUT0|"""If finances all Greek to you, you're not alone."
NEUT1|Financial theory revolves around two Greek letters.
NEUT2|Beta is the return you get from the market.
NEUT3|Alpha is that extra turn you generate from a particular investment.
NEUT4|By definition, everybody's alphas add up to zero or the same as beta.
NEUT5|The market return generating Alpha is difficult, but tracking beta is cheap and easy.
NEUT6|You buy an index fund, so now fund managers are creating smart beta.
BULL7|Cheap tracker funds that have a chance to beat the market.
NEUT8|How can they do that?
NEUT9|Traditional indexes give most weight to stocks with the highest market value.
NEUT10|That means they buy more hot stocks whose prices rising and don't fill up on bargains when they're cheap than you.
NEUT11|Trick is to wait indices differently.
NEUT12|According to companies book value or their dividends, or their sales.
NEUT13|That way they should avoid over exposing to expensive stocks.
NEUT14|They also follow indices that chase factors that.
NEUT15|Academics have found beat the market in the long run size.
NEUT16|Small companies beat big ones value cheap stocks beat expensive ones, and momentum stocks that are winning keep winning.
NEUT17|In theory, you pay a little more than for a normal index fund and still get to beat the market.
NEUT18|The Snag Smart Beta can't last forever if everyone does this.
NEUT19|"Cheap companies catch up and smart beta no longer beats the index."""
