NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video I will be talking about Facebook stock ticker symbol FB.
NEUT4|OK now this will be a very quick video.
NEUT5|I will just show you guys the play that we did today which is why you should be in a discord rooms right?
NEUT6|We did a nice scout play today and I also held one for the bigger run up right?
NEUT7|So.
NEUT8|Make sure you guys smash that like button and subscribe and also turn publications.
NEUT9|OK so this is what you would get in the discord.
NEUT10|So I saw something on Facebook, right had to pump up.
NEUT11|Came back down.
NEUT12|Pump up again came back down right and I believe so I'll show you guys the post that we did but I believe around 848 or 849 around this area is when we bought the call option right?
NEUT13|It was a it was a weekly call option I told.
NEUT14|What I was looking for was that push above 305, so 305 right we had to push right above 305, but then it dropped.
NEUT15|But this drop right when you experience?
NEUT16|You know this is nothing to be worried about because I believe the stock will go higher so we did not sell.
NEUT17|Right Dennis Soul when higher again stalled out.
BULL18|Boom pushed above the old high right now we're around 308 and I think we sold.
NEUT19|We sold somewhere around here.
NEUT20|I'll give you the time steps as well.
NEUT21|And then the stocks doing up and we're still holding one for the stock to go even higher, right?
NEUT22|I left one on just for fun for the stock to go higher now the stock close around 308.91 as you can tell that is up after hours 309309 fifty three on 61 so close to a dollar up after hours, right?
NEUT23|I think the stock could have some more run in it.
NEUT24|But we did exit the other options to always get a profit, right?
NEUT25|You always want to pay yourself.
NEUT26|OK, so now I'll show you the call that we did on Discord.
NEUT27|OK, so that's the call we did on the discord.
NEUT28|I get calls like that all the time.
NEUT29|So you make sure you want to get in.
NEUT30|That first link is a discord is free, so you get these options for free.
NEUT31|OK until May 1st it will be limited people in there, so once that limit is hit it will be closed and that would be it.
NEUT32|You'll miss your turn.
