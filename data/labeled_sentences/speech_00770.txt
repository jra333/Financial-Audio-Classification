NEUT0|"""I'll talk some crypto."
NEUT1|Do you know what the world's most widely used cryptocurrency is?
NEUT2|Let me give you a hint.
NEUT3|It's not Bitcoin.
NEUT4|Data from coinmarketcap.com shows that a token with the highest trading volume is Tether.
NEUT5|Yahoo Finance's, Oscar Williams Group joins us now from London.
NEUT6|Oscar, I thought Tether was some kind of Federal Reserve program here, but it's actually a cryptocurrency.
NEUT7|That's right, and a pretty widely used one.
NEUT8|Brian, it's a stable coin, which essentially means it is pegged to the dollar, one for one, and that basically explains why it is so widely used.
NEUT9|Tether is used by a lot of these exchanges around the world.
NEUT10|The cryptocurrency exchanges to offer dollar like liquid ITI.
NEUT11|Now remember most big banks don't want to deal with cryptocurrencies, so if you're a customer on one of these exchanges and you sell your Bitcoin, your ripple your ether.
NEUT12|For a dollar, rather than getting an actual dollar, they will just give you a tether instead, which represents $1.00.
NEUT13|That way they only have to deal with dollars when you are cashing out from the exchange.
BULL14|Now Tether overtook Bitcoin in terms of volume in April, and in August of this year started doing it pretty consistently.
BULL15|It averages about $21 billion worth of turnover each day, compared to just $17 billion for Bitcoin.
NEUT16|Alright, so lay out for us the risks because I'm sure there are some when it comes to dealing with tether Oscar.
BULL17|Definitely.
NEUT18|I mean one of the primary risks is that this dollar peg is broken.
BEAR19|There have been a lot of attempts by speculators to try and break the peg, which would mean you're left with a lot less cash than you think you have now.
BEAR20|The reason the speculators have been targeting Tether is big 'cause there has been a lot of speculation that the company that issues Tether doesn't have the correct reserves.
NEUT21|In fact, earlier this year it admitted it only covers for 74%.
NEUT22|There is also.
NEUT23|Dangers around the fact that it is one company that controls this unlike Bitcoin, which is of course decentralized.
