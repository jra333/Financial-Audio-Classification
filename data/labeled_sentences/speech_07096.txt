BEAR0|"""Yeah, this is a masterpiece quarter."
NEUT1|I mean that that's an iPhone number that was not even in the best case scenario.
BULL2|You combine what we're seeing, double digit growth in in this pandemic.
NEUT3|It just shows the supercycle.
BULL4|The hype was there.
BEAR5|The stocks obviously run now.
NEUT6|It's a reality.
NEUT7|I believe we could be looking at 200 forty 250,000,000 units for the year and I think this is a sweep.
NEUT8|The leg movement for the Barras.
NEUT9|I think ultimately this really throws out.
NEUT10|Then they give thesis if there was any on Apple.
NEUT11|It's a real cycle.
BULL12|China continues to fuel on iPhones as well as services and to re rating stories.
BEAR13|Still halfway through stock is down somewhat surprisingly, by 4% in after hours, so let's get back to Josh Lipton's got more analysis for us.
NEUT14|Hey Josh, so if I did have a chance to catch up with Apple CEO Tim Cook, we talked about the quarter.
NEUT15|First.
BULL16|I want to talk about the iPhone franchise up 17% to that 65.6 billion, where the trends and themes he's seeing their cook telling me they're full of features that customers love, he said.
NEUT17|And they came in at exactly.
NEUT18|The right time with where 5G networks were between the advances on 5G and the camera, customers really love the models.
BEAR19|The customer satisfaction is literally off the charts.
BEAR20|He also did tell me that they are supply constrained on the 12 Pro hoping to come into supply demand balance there soon.
NEUT21|He said.
NEUT22|We also talked about the pandemic, the lockdowns, how is that affected?
BEAR23|The iPhone franchise with stores being impacted and cooked.
BEAR24|It tell me that has been a drag on sales.
NEUT25|For iPhones an wearables.
NEUT26|Also, we talked about China.
BULL27|Like I said Greater China revenue.
BULL28|Up nearly 60%, I asked him how the iPhone was performing in China, Cook telling me when the final numbers come in for iPhone sales.
BULL29|There he said you're going to see that we gained share in Q1 so it was a really good quarter.
BULL30|Great product at the right time and we had great growth.
BULL31|He said in the other categories as well in China, iPad even higher than the company average Mac even higher in the company average.
BULL32|Anna wearables home accessories even higher than the company average.
BULL33|So China he said was strong across the board.
NEUT34|Guys back to you.
NEUT35|Josh Lipton, great to get that color and commentary from Tim Cook on the quarter.
BULL36|Thank you very much at Lee.
NEUT37|What stands out to you from the results?
BEAR38|Really strong growth in China is Josh highlighted and then off the charts.
BULL39|Customer satisfaction according to Tim Club from the new phones.
BEAR40|Yeah, it is a blowout quarter.
NEUT41|Absolutely.
BULL42|I think the Greater China growth is super interesting.
NEUT43|I mean we, I think investors have always thought of Apple is kind of this weird hybrid companies or this value in one end and potential growth on the other.
BULL44|China clearly is really really picking up for them.
NEUT45|So the growth is there at least on that side of it.
NEUT46|But I was surprised by every element.
NEUT47|I think the iPhone number was pretty crazy, so you know, people are really looking for the high end phone.
NEUT48|They want the latest, but the broader for me the broader theme is it it just really cements Apple as more of a lifestyle company?
NEUT49|I know we tend to think of it as you know, hardware and high tech, which it is.
NEUT50|And these Alpha users always go for the latest, but you know they've created this ecosystem right?
NEUT51|So that's why services is going as high in a steady as it has been, because for every device you buy, your more.
NEUT52|More sort of keyed into all of their services, whether it's their I cloud stuff for their music service or news or whatever my fees.
NEUT53|You're just sort of kind of locked in and it's it's an ecosystem company now.
NEUT54|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT55|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
