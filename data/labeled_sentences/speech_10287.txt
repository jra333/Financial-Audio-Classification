NEUT0|"""Look, this is not."
NEUT1|It's the same group of usual suspects, but I think there's a lot of mystery.
NEUT2|That is when you see a stock like this and people begin to think our price is real.
NEUT3|Our price is real.
NEUT4|Is the market unregulated?
NEUT5|And then as soon as you say that the regular people say, well, it's unregulated for the hedge funds, but it's regulated for us and I would tend to look at say, well, Twitter just announced some good numbers that we should be looking at Twitter, Domino's, a little bit of a shortfall, or let's take a look at the Moderna news.
NEUT6|But Carl, this is what's gripping America and we don't really have an answer, I know.
NEUT7|You know our challenge will be to to deal with the the corporate news that we can actually understand, but I want to.
NEUT8|I want to get your point here.
NEUT9|When you have Ryan tweeting pictures of ice cream with the frog.
NEUT10|When Musk tweets a picture of the Doge coin dog on the moon, do you believe that these executives are trying to move names not by the letter but by the spirit?
NEUT11|And is there room for regulation there?
NEUT12|I think the 1st Amendment protects ice cream cone pictures and what?
NEUT13|Elon must, I'm not kidding.
NEUT14|See First Amendment look analysts come out every day and they raised the price target.
NEUT15|Well, these guys are raising the price target in a different sort of way.
NEUT16|David, I know that it's a new world.
NEUT17|The ice cream machine is working again.
NEUT18|That seems to be what's working.
NEUT19|The ice cream machine?
NEUT20|'cause at McDonald's it's always broken, but now it's working.
NEUT21|If you've never been to McDonald's, I just wanna tell you One X 70 now used to be the one in Forest Hills back in the early 70s.
NEUT22|Really, yeah, well for it right in there.
NEUT23|I think it's still there.
NEUT24|Yeah, it's probably.
NEUT25|It's all right now.
NEUT26|We have so much corporate same neighborhood.
NEUT27|We have big corporate news.
BULL28|I mean we but you know to brothers that was great quarter Caterpillar upgrade.
NEUT29|This is fascinating.
NEUT30|And by the way, there's plenty of hedge fund manager Jim.
NEUT31|I mean you probably bought you bought stocks for less reason than an ice cream cone.
NEUT32|You did, you know you did?
NEUT33|I mean all that analysis and everything else you did so who knows.
NEUT34|But David, you can't have a stock triple in the last hour without having to figure out that the company about the company should come out and say we see no reason for our stock.
NEUT35|Maybe this time the company will figure out a way to sell some stock.
NEUT36|To the point you kept.
NEUT37|That's why one table cell without a CFO Bitcoin at your mom and become the crypto place.
NEUT38|Don't use Nero, I mean you just come up with stuff out of it.
NEUT39|What are you doing?
NEUT40|I'm telling you about the ice cream, but at least I have a plant.
NEUT41|This is the man is maybe the most absurd discussion we've ever had, really.
BULL42|Yeah, I think it's getting close.
NEUT43|Quarrel, I think that the average American right now is trying to figure out how do I find a stock that triples in the last hour?
NEUT44|Forget what you guys are talking about with the Fang.
NEUT45|I want to triple and that is not necessarily what we can provide, but it is what people want.
NEUT46|They want to trip.
NEUT47|Robin Hood wants it Wall Street.
NEUT48|That's fine with you.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
