NEUT0|"""Patron, he's been watching the show now for an hour once to see Amgen and I would to."
BULL1|Amgen is a leader by the Biopharmaceuticals flagship.
NEUT2|Drugs include red but as epigen an Aaron Espe.
NEUT3|And some other weird names.
NEUT4|OK, so with drug companies, the Great News is they have patents.
NEUT5|When they have patents they own that market.
BEAR6|When the patents go away, they lose that entire market.
NEUT7|So the big thing is, is there a good pipeline for this company that is the qualitative aspect that I'm not going to look at on this analysis.
NEUT8|We're going to look at as is right now.
NEUT9|What was the company that we looked at where 50% of the revenue came from Humira?
NEUT10|That was, yeah, that was a Pfizer no?
NEUT11|Or is it?
NEUT12|Is it done?
NEUT13|Wasn't Biogen?
NEUT14|Oh sorry, whatever it was.
BEAR15|The whole point is and they're losing their Humira patent here shortly.
BEAR16|So that 50% of the revenue is going away.
BEAR17|It's going to be decreasing drastically.
NEUT18|So for Amgen, we want to pay attention to this stuff.
NEUT19|So $130 billion company, 17 PE check Mark, 31% profit margin check mark 3% dividend or dividend is 1.2 * 3.4 billion.
NEUT20|Just to be conservative, $4 billion check check check though.
BULL21|Chuck Chuck about revenue growth Pillar #321 to 22.2.
NEUT22|Profit growth pool pillar #4 baby profit growth.
NEUT23|Find 6.9 to 7 point.
NEUT24|Check mark.
NEUT25|As you can see.
NEUT26|These are not big growing.
BULL27|It's not fast growing company over 20 billion to 22.
NEUT28|Abby was the one that had humera, so those are big, fast growing companies.
NEUT29|You gotta member that we look at your multiples if they're not growing fast, you cannot pay a big multiple 'cause you had to get your return based on the current cash flow that's coming in for check marks in a row for Amgen.
NEUT30|Keep going 758 shares, 605 check Mark there five in a row.
NEUT31|Let's go 5 a bit.
NEUT32|All five baby.
NEUT33|Let's go to current assets greater than current liabilities.
BULL34|22.7 versus 9.95 wowser.
BULL35|That's good.
BULL36|Great stuff.
NEUT37|Another thing I like about it is their inventory is not a big chunk of that of that number.
BULL38|That's a big plus for me.
NEUT39|Amgen let's look at free cash flow growth over the past five years.
NEUT40|This is why I love guys.
BULL41|These drug companies have amazing free cash flow.
NEUT42|Alright, so they went from 9.1 billion to 8.5, so it's an experiment, so let's check out the rest of it.
NEUT43|09 point 610.510 point.
NEUT44|Thanks.
NEUT45|Plus eight, what's the lesson for 8.8 point?
BEAR46|510.6 / 5 is 9.6.
NEUT47|Market cap 130 billion?
NEUT48|It's not a fast growing company.
BEAR49|130 billion doesn't seem bad to me.
NEUT50|13 times does not seem awful so.
NEUT51|I like this.
NEUT52|Oh 3% dividend was four billion.
NEUT53|They can easily afford that.
NEUT54|OK, I like this.
NEUT55|What you need to do now is look at their pipeline.
NEUT56|How is their pipeline relative?
BULL57|Do they have this revenue stream growing?
NEUT58|Is it staying the same?
NEUT59|What are they doing to make sure that it maintained they made a big acquisition last year?
NEUT60|13.6 billion.
NEUT61|What was that?
NEUT62|Let's find that out.
NEUT63|They did big acquisitions earlier in the decade.
NEUT64|So there maybe this acquisition had something to do with with making sure that they keep their pipeline growing.
NEUT65|But I kind of like this.
NEUT66|The question is how do they fund us?
NEUT67|They fund this fund this with financing.
NEUT68|I don't know either way, I'm not.
NEUT69|"I'm not opposed to Amgen."""
