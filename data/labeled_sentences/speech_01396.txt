NEUT0|"""I'm Shelby holiday an it's time for Barron's buzz."
NEUT1|Joining me to talk about the latest issue is senior editor Jack Cowan.
NEUT2|Jack.
NEUT3|Let's talk about Warren Buffett because who doesn't like to talk about workforce?
NEUT4|He is the subject and the star of a new documentary.
NEUT5|It's coming out Monday.
NEUT6|Take a quick look.
NEUT7|How are they a sausage Mcmuffin with egg and cheese 317 is a bacon egg and cheese biscuit.
NEUT8|The markets down this morning, so I think I'll pass up to 317 and go with the tune.
NEUT9|Market so markets down he's worth more than $70 billion, but he picked his breakfast based on what the market is doing.
NEUT10|This is why I'm not a billionaire.
NEUT11|I'm not getting that sausage and egg sandwich at McDonald's every morning.
NEUT12|That's gotta be the secret.
NEUT13|I'm not sure and I hear his wife puts the change in cups for him.
NEUT14|That might be before he leaves the house.
NEUT15|You know, that really does seem to be all kidding aside like a commonality among the some of these wildly successful genius people as they take these everyday tasks.
NEUT16|Other people spend time thinking about and they just kind of have them taken care of.
NEUT17|They don't have to give it any thought.
NEUT18|They do the same thing every day and they move on with what's important right?
NEUT19|Exactly the man, yeah, good film.
NEUT20|The man knows what he enjoys.
NEUT21|We've got to look at the Fillmore writer.
NEUT22|Does we like it?
NEUT23|People should watch it when it comes out well and buff.
BEAR24|It also says in this documentary that he is physically depreciate ING.
BULL25|Yes, but Behrens writes that the Berkshire Hathaway stock price is looking pretty good.
NEUT26|He writes that he's physically depreciated, depreciate ING and approaching salvage value, yes, but I don't know.
NEUT27|I don't know he might be overstating the case.
BULL28|But yeah, the stock has been a fine performer.
BEAR29|Our writer points out that some of these big academic endowments that haven't really done great relative to the index is overtime.
NEUT30|I want to take a peek.
NEUT31|It's either get into an index themselves or take a peek at something like Berkshire one out.
BULL32|It's doing better than some of these hedge funds.
NEUT33|Slash alternative type investments.
NEUT34|They've been locked up in alright, good article, and Next up, it's the last installment of the Barron's Roundtable.
BEAR35|Yes, for now, I know you're sad to see it go.
NEUT36|Pumped.
NEUT37|But yeah, we do have a look at our last group of stock pickers this week.
NEUT38|You can hear from Abby, Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs who likes to collect all of the topics from their Top Stock pickers.
NEUT39|And so we have those for you and Brian Rogers.
NEUT40|At T. Rowe Price, we have Oscar Schaefer in there, so our last round of stock picks from our roundtable.
NEUT41|Alright?
BULL42|That'll be a good one.
NEUT43|And last but not least, yes, you guys aren't skipping a beat.
NEUT44|We hit Dow 20 K. You don't even have time to celebrate.
NEUT45|You already looking at Dow thirty K30K cover story.
NEUT46|When are you predicting Dow 30K?
NEUT47|There's good news and bad news.
NEUT48|I think mostly good news.
BULL49|OK, we're going to hit it.
NEUT50|It's going to take two too long, but returns from here we don't think are going to be gangbusters.
NEUT51|I don't think you would want them to be.
BEAR52|I think that if you see a raging stock market between here and summer, then that's probably a warning sign.
BEAR53|What you would want to see is an investor for returns to slow a little bit to keep pace with earnings, which I think that growth there is going to be better and not great.
NEUT54|I think maybe you're you're looking at something like mid highs mid to high single digit.
BULL55|Returns in coming years.
NEUT56|Or maybe we get to that 30,000 around 2025 ish.
BULL57|Alright nice slow climb.
NEUT58|I know that that's not a room from market that people would would like to hear, but look it's not if we do it in that fashion then we're not setting ourselves up for the market to tank either.
BULL59|And that's good news for long term savers.
NEUT60|Did you get any doubt?
NEUT61|20 K souvenirs this year?
NEUT62|Was I?
NEUT63|I know you got some.
NEUT64|Now you're trying to make me jealous.
NEUT65|Right now.
NEUT66|I'm just curious.
NEUT67|I didn't get into the ball.
NEUT68|Still has about 10,000 caps.
NEUT69|Have to save him.
