NEUT0|"""You don't need to ask the government."
NEUT1|It's not there.
NEUT2|Stay cool.
NEUT3|This is a Thor news presentation.
NEUT4|Stay cool.
NEUT5|Hit the button baby Thor News presents we have mega glitches ******* that's right come on down for a special Doom episode of Thor News as we discuss the offline state of affairs.
NEUT6|This started back on June 30th when the Dawn Spacecraft Orbiting Series suffered a glitch and went into Safe mode and that on July 4th the New Horizons spacecraft approaching Pluto.
NEUT7|So for the glitch.
BEAR8|Went into safe mode and then on July 8th **** kicked into super high gear as United Aircraft, the second largest aircraft in the world suffered glitch shutting down the entire airline causing mass people to rush to social media to complain and then zero hedge went offline, which most people should be assigned and that the New York Stock Exchange Server glitch and went offline and that the Wall Street Journal.
BEAR9|On offline and this is all on top of the Greek banks and stock markets being shut down for over a week and 50% of all stocks on the Chinese stock markets being shut down and offline until further notice.
NEUT10|So these are strange days indeed, so I recommend smoke'em if you got to cuddle as much as you can and love your fellow man and woman.
NEUT11|These are strange days indeed.
NEUT12|Man like I mentioned before, it seems like.
NEUT13|The real glitch is in everybody's mind where they're focused on a future that is absolutely negative, whether it be World War, three, negative, New World order, martial law, currency collapse.
NEUT14|It seems like nobody believes that a good future as possible, and that makes me sad, so I'll be that one idiot that believes we can all get out of this mess somehow together, as one people of Earth and put this archaic caveman ursery.
NEUT15|War machine system behind this.
NEUT16|Or who knows man.
NEUT17|Today I spent today like watching out the window, preparing for bright flash.
NEUT18|Birds are in there.
NEUT19|So yeah, I always say that when I cover subjects that planted X comments, the real doom is in economics and we've had a currency war for years now that continues to get hotter and hotter by the day.
NEUT20|The Quickening is only getting quicker.
NEUT21|Superman, where are you now?
NEUT22|Sorry this was not funny really wasn't that funny but day?
NEUT23|You know, I'm saying anyway, but I also wanted to report that Republicans blamed Democrats for everything that a curd, and then Democrats blamed Republicans for everything that a curd.
NEUT24|So that's where we are frozen and stuck man.
NEUT25|See, I guess is why haven't been making videos like this.
BEAR26|**** is just too pressing.
NEUT27|Alright?
NEUT28|Well God bless everybody.
BULL29|"Have a great day."""
