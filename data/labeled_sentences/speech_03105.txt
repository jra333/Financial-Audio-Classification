NEUT0|"""Hello, this is RV Ramachandran."
NEUT1|I'm a technical analyst over at Ashliman.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to walk through our weekly cycle analysis in Facebook.
NEUT3|So for those who are new to our work, just want to go over what we're looking at here at the bottom of the trial, we have our cycle.
NEUT4|Brackets and cycles are a way for us to track the money flow patterns.
NEUT5|In an out of a stock, we look for lowest form around the troughs of cycles which means around this.
NEUT6|Right here.
NEUT7|And once we form those lows, we would enter what we call.
NEUT8|Rising phase is an A rising phase is when you will look for money flow to come in an for rallies on the upside and you can see really how clear these rising faces have been in Facebook over the past several years.
NEUT9|Here an in the later stages of cycles.
NEUT10|This is where there is risk of downside and what you'll see here is in each of these cycles.
NEUT11|How clear.
NEUT12|These corrective periods have been in Facebook.
NEUT13|So where are we now is that we are in one of these corrective periods on this dominant cycle that I'm showing for you right here.
NEUT14|Our next key weekly cycle, oh is do 10:26 to 12:28.
BEAR15|So that is our window of time to look for that next key weekly cycle low.
BEAR16|So overall, given that our weekly momentum is also configured negatively, as you can see by this Purple line here.
NEUT17|The sum of the evidence does favor further downside.
NEUT18|Here in Facebook there are intermediate term supports coming in from 256 to 244, and if it gets through that level, there is an intermediate 78.6 Feb at around 2:28 or so.
