NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to this technique and analysis video here at exam.com."
NEUT1|It's Friday, June the 7th and the pair were going to look at.
BEAR2|Today is the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar, which if you look at the daily chart now, we can see that it is currently facing various signals as the RSI's making lower highs and lower lows under 50 and the market is in negative area for the first time since March and under its red signal line.
NEUT3|However, it's also worth noting that the price is currently trading.
BULL4|Along the Lower Bollinger Bank and is not far above that ascending line that was quite restrictive back in January and February.
BULL5|Therefore, any potential downside in the short term could find a key support around one point 3320 and at the bottom of the chemical cloud.
BEAR6|If we violate that level, then the focus will shift straight down to the 200 day moving average at one point 3270 at the moment, where any break lower could extend losses down to 1.30.
BULL7|Two are looking to the upside now immediate resistance could be found around one point 3445 and a 200 to the 20 day moving average while another move higher may stop at one point 35 of breaking that number two, we need a stronger bullish action to overcome the peak.
NEUT8|At one point 3563 and reach 1.36.
NEUT9|In this case other three month picture which is currently neutral would turn back to bullish.
NEUT10|So that's all from me.
BULL11|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
