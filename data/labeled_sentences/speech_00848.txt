BEAR0|"""So in looking at Google we see that it has continued down after this bounce."
NEUT1|That should mean this is kind of an old man kind of bar.
NEUT2|If we look at the monthly chart, it also has responded to this note demand narrow spread and has come down the target I have is that it will be crossing the Bollinger Band and coming down to this area and this chart is.
BULL3|Assistant because it's coming back to this top area which it had been before meeting resistance again.
BEAR4|At this level, an coming back down.
NEUT5|This is kind of confirmed by the stochastic here that it's top coming back in this top now it's coming back down.
NEUT6|Only weekly chart.
BEAR7|We see that it's already down here, so I feel it should be kind of like back here where the stock is dropping and the stochastic is hovering down.
NEUT8|Here and on the weekly chart.
BEAR9|Originally felt that it was going to drop because of this coming back down and then it might do some balance before dropped again and it looks like it has done that on the weekly that it is going to drop down from that bounce on the daily chart we see that there is no demand here.
BEAR10|And there's this is a upthrust here going up and coming down.
BEAR11|And on earnings date, it came back down, so this should confirm the weakness of this multi man at this and this little here should be making this little top and with a high volume this drop should be a significant drop or rather a comfort confirmation move that it will continue to drop as very similar to what happened to Google before.
NEUT12|I feel that it might be happening very similarly if we look at.
NEUT13|What happened?
NEUT14|In a previous earning instance.
BEAR15|We see that this gap down.
BEAR16|Followed by very large role Amiana continue dropping of the stock over the next few weeks.
NEUT17|About two weeks or so.
NEUT18|Three weeks or so.
NEUT19|April 14 all the way to May 6 so I feel this time it's very similar.
BEAR20|"The drop with a big volume and if we go to hear this drop with a big volume and it should be coming down like that very similarly."""
