NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart ticker symbol HG."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Can sample Bob $34.50 I don't get me wrong.
BEAR9|If the price falls below that level, that does not mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL10|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very beneficial because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT15|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT16|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control of your most.
NEUT17|Visualize that that is what has been presented against and above that level would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT18|As long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT19|As far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|Nothing fancy or complicated here, just a question of where departing momentum finally stopped today and that was up there right around $37.15 so 3715 will be Public Enemy number one moving forward, but All in all, any angle you look at it.
BULL21|Fantastic volume today, very nice price, movement and now going forward.
NEUT22|It's just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum?
NEUT23|So let's see what happens.
NEUT24|It's only Tuesday, still three days left on the week, so what's the other price action continues to play out?
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird.
NEUT30|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT31|But in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
