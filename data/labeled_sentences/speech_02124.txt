NEUT0|"""Hi, this is Mike Riedmiller with Reed Miller Wealth Management talking about some of the things that you should potentially look for when working with a financial advisor or considering a new advisor."
NEUT1|I feel it can be very important that that advisor has an education platform.
NEUT2|Now I am a best selling author.
NEUT3|I wrote a book with Jack Canfield.
NEUT4|You might remember his name from the chicken soup for the Soul series of books and wrote that with some other industry professionals that achieved bestseller status on Amazon in 2016.
NEUT5|In addition, I'm a Forbes brand voice contributor.
NEUT6|I've written an article for Forbes in their brand voice section and I've got some other ones coming up.
NEUT7|I've also got an educational platform, smart money, planning.com, and educational course, but my point is.
NEUT8|Working with a financial advisor or considering one, I feel it can be very important again that they got that educational platform where they're providing real value in education, not based around them trying to make a sale, but based around them helping you get that education.
NEUT9|Whether you're a client to their firm or not, you know you can go to my website smartmoneyplanning.com, you can watch the educational videos.
NEUT10|It's like it's it's own online workshop.
NEUT11|Basically, but instead of going to a library or a college or a steakhouse, you could do this from the comfort of your own home.
NEUT12|You can watch the videos as often as you want.
NEUT13|There's also worksheets and downloads.
NEUT14|So again, though.
NEUT15|"Having that educational content as an advisor, I feel is very important, so something else to consider when looking into financial advisor."""
