BULL0|"""Welcome back to 10X stocks."
NEUT1|Today we are going through NEO stock analysis and predictions December 14th.
NEUT2|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, why NIO stock news are not as bad as you might think?
NEUT3|The electric vehicle maker NIO that has captured the imagination of many investors around the world.
BEAR4|However, in the past few days NIO stock has been trading lower and lower every day.
NEUT5|I have already made a video talking about the bad news.
NEUT6|However, in this video I want to kind of show you the positive side and what the future brings for this Chinese F maker.
NEUT7|First of all, the sell off is not bad news.
NEUT8|When companies raise additional capital.
NEUT9|This is very common and this also isn't happening because Neo is in any urgent need of cash.
NEUT10|Quite the opposite.
NEUT11|Neo does not currently need extra cash, however, these are funds that will be used to help with new technology and to get prepared for a potential recession in the future.
BEAR12|The same thing happened to Tesla when it fell over 50% on news like this and it quickly went up.
NEUT13|So with this I want to let you know that this is no bad news fornaio.
NEUT14|In fact, think of this as a buying opportunity.
BULL15|I just bought more Nile shares at $39.00 today and I still believe it is a very good stock for the long term.
NEUT16|NIO stock price predictions.
NEUT17|There are many different predictions for the Neo stock, however I would like to shed some light on the incredibly bullish Neo stock price prediction by CNN.
BEAR18|Out of their 13 analysts, eight of them are saying Nioh is a by 4 are saying hold and only one is bearish on the stock.
NEUT19|The median price prediction for the next 12 months by CNN is $327.39.
NEUT20|The maximum is $394.93.
BEAR21|The lowest Neo stock price prediction for the next 12 months is $104.51.
BEAR22|This is why US investors should not be worried about the slight drops and many analysts on Wall Street are saying that we will never see Nioh below $40 a share again.
BULL23|So think of today as a good buying opportunity as analysts are claiming that Neo will be very green tomorrow.
BEAR24|In conclusion, I still see no reason on why Nile stock could be a bad stock.
BULL25|I remain bullish on the stock and believe that in the future it will be a leader in the F industry with a buy rating.
BULL26|Thanks for watching.
