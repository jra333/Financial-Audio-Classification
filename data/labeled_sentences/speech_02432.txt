BULL0|"""No, I did get good morning now."
BEAR1|Done business news today Disney, the company in Burbank, their shares are falling.
NEUT2|This is due to the.
BEAR3|This duty, ESPN losing their subscribers.
BEAR4|Now I don't know why ESPN is losing subscribers said so.
NEUT5|Most people probably watch a lot of their sports coverage.
NEUT6|But I guess probably they're running a free subscription base.
NEUT7|For people who want to subscribe for free.
NEUT8|And I guess.
BEAR9|They're losing money over that.
NEUT10|But realistically.
NEUT11|I would say that I don't know why they are declining, because ESPN is outdoing other sports networks like Fox Sports for instance.
NEUT12|Which is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
NEUT13|And I go to ESPN.com often.
BEAR14|So I don't know why the media says they're losing money over that for a lot of subscribers.
NEUT15|But I guess Disney is probably focusing on their other businesses like the ABC television networks.
NEUT16|Movie studios like their own and basically Pixar and other.
NEUT17|Studios like Marvel Marvel Comics 'cause they recently they they own Star Wars and the old Marvel Comics so they're controlling near there.
NEUT18|These companies as well.
NEUT19|So be difficult to control.
NEUT20|Most companies try to get a grasp on ESPN.
NEUT21|With good explain why Disney is losing some money in the process.
NEUT22|ESPN is really a big moneymaker for them.
NEUT23|Now a lot of people watch sports like fraction of people watch a lot of sports, so I guess that could explain.
NEUT24|Maybe you have different ideas, but I'm just giving you my perspective on this.
NEUT25|"That's all for now."""
