NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, it's Alisa Corum here with your technical analysis today we're looking at how a stock can have multiple by points when it's in the base building process for a considerable amount of time."
BULL1|Amazon is one of our stocks to watch this week, and even though the tech Giants suffered quite a bit of damage during the sell off of 2018, it has offered investors a chance to buy as it's recovered and now that shares are nearing all time highs.
BULL2|Again, another buying opportunity is presenting itself.
BULL3|So let's take a look at this daily chart here now Amazon sold off as much as 35% during the correction and as the stock rebounded it was able to form a base with a 736 fifty one by point and on March 18th Amazon broke out above that level.
BULL4|Now volume was only slightly above average that day, but shares are now about 13% above the buy Point and Amazon is currently getting a boost after Warren Buffett said that a money manager at Berkshire Hathaway bought shares of the E Commerce Giant.
BULL5|Now, if Amazon can continue to extend its gains, that would help the stock close in on its prior highs, which would be considered a buying opportunity.
BEAR6|Now the stock is about 4% below potential by point.
NEUT7|At 2050 sixty.
NEUT8|And while some might wonder whether Amazon is currently clearing a handle buy point here, this is actually too short to be a proper handle which would need at least five days to form now.
NEUT9|Investors should keep an eye on Amazon's relative strength line too.
NEUT10|That's the blue line on the chart.
BULL11|Now it has been moving higher as a sock is made its run.
BEAR12|But it's still below all time highs that coincided with the stocks.
BULL13|All time price highs back over here now.
BULL14|We also would like to see this relative strength line hitting a new all time high as the stock breaks out into new high ground because that would be a bullish technical indicator.
NEUT15|Now we also want to look at the fundamentals here.
BULL16|Amazon's annual earnings growth for 2019 projected to hit 35% growth.
BULL17|That's expected to accelerate to 41% in 2020.
NEUT18|Now that's the kind of growth we like to see for top growth stocks.
BULL19|Seeing annual earnings growth of 25% or more is ideal, and it's even better to see that growth accelerate.
NEUT20|So when you're looking for top stocks to buy, sometimes multiple of buying opportunities may present themselves for investors business daily.
NEUT21|I'm Alyssa Coram.
