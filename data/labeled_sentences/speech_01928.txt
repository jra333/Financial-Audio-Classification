NEUT0|"""Ask man I got a ton of AM one from Dan."
BULL1|He said this last night strengthened Trump's hand in the world with trade or stay about the same.
NEUT2|Seems pretty clear American farmers are behind the president.
NEUT3|Yes, not only did his Senate candidates and so we've been growing County in countries County rather win, but they want big time.
NEUT4|I think President Xi in China is paying attention.
NEUT5|WJ Walker wants to know your thoughts about Amazon stock.
NEUT6|I gotta tell you something.
BEAR7|I think Amazon is facing competition on several fronts from retail the cloud.
BULL8|And investors are going to probably have to adjust the way they look at this company, but long term, I think the stock goes significantly higher from here.
BULL9|I think it will dominate in its core businesses and it's got a lot of other businesses that have a lot of room to grow.
NEUT10|And then there's my boy, Todd, Bubba Horwitz.
BULL11|Thanks for the shout out, he said.
NEUT12|Charles.
NEUT13|What are you drinking?
NEUT14|Send me some of it.
NEUT15|I want to feel good.
BEAR16|We know the Fed will blow it as history proves markets will close a year lower than they are now.
NEUT17|Commodities are the place to be for now.
NEUT18|I gotta tell you I mentioned it earlier in the show.
NEUT19|I have to believe that Jay Powell, who by the way is a student of history.
NEUT20|And not a classically trained fed head is going to do the right thing, at least I'm hoping this time will be different.
NEUT21|That's why it's incredibly important tomorrow that maybe Powell take that opportunity, at least the first opportunity can to clarify the range.
NEUT22|What's neutrality and let the market know the Fed won't blow it again.
NEUT23|Then there's Jim.
NEUT24|In Minneapolis.
NEUT25|He wants to know how High Berkshire Hathaway shares will go he owns in a 64 houses shared.
BEAR26|Jim, I'm jealous.
NEUT27|I gotta tell you something to 1st congratulations.
NEUT28|I'm long the stock as well, but.
NEUT29|At a much higher price, here's the thing.
BULL30|The company just reported, and I'm not sure how high is going to go, but the company reported the stock did very well.
NEUT31|Warren Buffett bought back a billion dollars worth of its own stock, so I think the businesses humming, especially in the rail business.
BULL32|They've got some pricing power there.
NEUT33|I say stay the course with this talk.
NEUT34|I don't think you can go wrong.
NEUT35|And then there's Martin Sebrell who junior he says.
NEUT36|Can you explain to your viewers what a margin call is?
NEUT37|I think this is a great question because many believe.
BEAR38|This is a huge problem for the market.
NEUT39|First of all, margin.
NEUT40|According to FINRA, you get the margin is alone that you get from a firm when you buy securities.
NEUT41|Now you can buy securities on margin, but you have to repay the amount that you borrow any interest and if you lose money on your investment, you gotta pay that back to the equity in your account when it falls below a maintenance level that's required, the firm can sell other securities in your account.
BEAR42|That's the margin call they cover that deficiency and January Finn were warned about the record level of margin debt.
BULL43|Outstanding, but more importantly, they were concerned about how quickly it grew as $100 billion in just one year.
BEAR44|That warning spook the market and margin debt has actually had since then.
NEUT45|But beware when you borrow this stuff, you gotta pay it back.
NEUT46|Hey, I got a ton of these questions.
BULL47|I appreciate them.
NEUT48|I love answering them.
NEUT49|I'm going to answer the rest of am also two stocks I just bought my own account.
