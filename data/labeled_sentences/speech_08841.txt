NEUT0|"""Joining us right now."
NEUT1|For more on the markets is all eons and Grammercy adviser Mohamed El Erian.
NEUT2|He's also the president of Queens College, Cambridge.
NEUT3|Mohammed.
NEUT4|What do you think?
NEUT5|What Mike was just talking about these huge gains that we've seen?
NEUT6|Is this going to be like times we've seen in the past?
NEUT7|So we need some time to maybe consolidate and grow into things.
NEUT8|We do, I mean, Becky.
NEUT9|We coming from a period where the economic call was hard, but the market call was was clear because you wanted to ride the liquid iti wave and you knew that that liquidity wave would continue.
BULL10|Now we've got better clarity on the economics, which makes the policy and therefore the liquid ITI wave more uncertain.
NEUT11|And that is a really important macro transition.
NEUT12|And I agree with Mike, you gotta look below when the macro transition complicates.
BEAR13|The outlook for the market you go down a few levels.
NEUT14|An constructed portfolio that way Wilder than constructed at the macro level.
NEUT15|Mohammed, the one thing I'll point out is this is different and I know it's always dangerous to say this is different than what we've seen in the past, but in the past you were talking about bigger problems that were more structural, not a shutdown of everything instantaneously and then a hopefully a re emergence back to the full economy.
NEUT16|It was different from that perspective and that we haven't seen something like this in 100 years.
NEUT17|It's also different from the perspective of what governments are doing this time around, especially the United States government, with the amount that they're willing to spend.
NEUT18|Can we look at the past and necessarily take a lot of lessons out of that?
NEUT19|I think he could take some lessons, but not enough and let me explain why we going through a an economic transition that is resulting from a combination of macroeconomic policies.
NEUT20|We have not seen before, which is fiscal pedal to the metal in a way that we've never seen before, and monetary pedal to the metal.
NEUT21|In a way we've never seen before.
NEUT22|We also going through a transition in the philosophy of economic policies.
NEUT23|Joe just mentioned it.
NEUT24|That raises a whole host of questions as to how well the economy react.
NEUT25|Inflation, which raises another set of issues which is with the liquidity paradigm that investors have benefited from so so much persist.
NEUT26|So that's why I think, Interestingly, we can define the economic issues, but in order to have a clear outlook on the economy, you need two calls.
NEUT27|We need to look into the mindset of a Fed going through its own policy paradigm transition, and we need to look into the psychology of a market condition.
NEUT28|I just liquidity and that's why the future is is more uncertain and that's why I like the idea of gold gold further down in your assessment, become much more granular at this point.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
