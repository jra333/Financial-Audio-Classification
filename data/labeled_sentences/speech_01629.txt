NEUT0|"""Here we have a story, Bitcoin magazine, a combination of supply and demand dynamics, and the actions of legacy financial systems will push Bitcoin to 200,000 in 2021."
NEUT1|You don't seem too excited will I believe, as I was finishing that headline, you took a huge yawn right there?
NEUT2|Well, it's 5:00 PM right now.
NEUT3|It's usually my bedtime can go back, go back.
NEUT4|5:00 PM.
BULL5|Yeah, yeah.
NEUT6|You're a Bitcoin guy, but it is exciting.
NEUT7|You're a Bitcoin guy?
NEUT8|Yeah, you won't.
NEUT9|You don't mind 200,000.
NEUT10|Not at all.
NEUT11|This particular article is looking at something called the Havings having Alving.
NEUT12|What a word having.
NEUT13|But I need to make sure you know there's an L in there, so I'm just going to say Alving, but it's having his value would say it.
NEUT14|Cycle.
NEUT15|Is it?
NEUT16|I mean, it really has to do with supply demand and this idea that the.
NEUT17|Unlike.
NEUT18|Fiat currency where the supply can change the supply for Bitcoin is doesn't change, and therefore they can track this various cycles to see how.
NEUT19|Previous history could potentially play out again as supply changes going forward.
NEUT20|Uhm, there's actually a pretty cool thread that aims to visualize the mechanics an I believe the tweet is embedded also in this article right here.
NEUT21|So if you are watching this show, you can.
NEUT22|Presumably have a better understanding if you look at the visualization, but either way.
NEUT23|The idea here is that you had similar mechanics at play back in 2012 and 2016.
NEUT24|That followed in.
NEUT25|2013 and 2017.
NEUT26|Mania and that 2020 is on track for the same.
NEUT27|I mean, that's the speculation here, but obviously, well, there's all kinds of incentives to say such a thing, particularly for those that are.
NEUT28|Holders of such things and stand to gain and benefit, and I'm reading the article on Bitcoin Magazine for that matter, yes.
NEUT29|All that said.
BEAR30|It's been a pretty hot day for crypto or no.
NEUT31|I thought Ethereum was kind of hot.
BULL32|Yeah, it's doing well OK. Like recently OK, yeah, yeah it's a visa main announcement.
NEUT33|They go up and down unit there, is that right?
NEUT34|They go up and down is what I heard, yeah well anyway.
NEUT35|If you care to follow up with some of the.
NEUT36|Models you can go look at it, but there's definitely.
BULL37|Lots of incentive.
NEUT38|To broadcast the potential $200,000 Bitcoin.
NEUT39|That's exciting, but if you look go back to the chart, go back to the chart will.
NEUT40|Give me a.
NEUT41|Give me and all.
NEUT42|Give me all on that.
NEUT43|I mean.
NEUT44|I mean, she shouldn't last year.
NEUT45|That's that's a bit ridiculous.
NEUT46|Yeah, the last year is a bit ridiculous.
NEUT47|They've had their moments too.
NEUT48|During the rise, couple of moments couple of weeks.
NEUT49|"Anyway, you guys let me know 200K yes or no."""
