NEUT0|"""Lloyd, you also mentioned the other main phenomenon on Wall Street right now, which seems to be Bitcoin, which seems to be going mainstream."
NEUT1|You have big firms now getting involved in ways that they didn't have.
NEUT2|Your views either evolved or changed around the future of Bitcoin and crypto.
NEUT3|Look, I've always been, you know I'm not, you know it could work.
NEUT4|It could work, but really at the end of the day you know a currency is supposed to accomplish a couple of things.
NEUT5|It's supposed to be a medium of exchange and a store of value.
NEUT6|You know it's a store of value that can move 10% in a day.
NEUT7|But if you lose the code or you lose the slip of paper, it's lossed forever.
NEUT8|Or if somebody takes it from you, how will you know?
NEUT9|So it's you know, the store of value elements a little bit tough an as a medium of exchange.
NEUT10|Here's a problem.
NEUT11|You don't know whether or not you're paying the North Koreans or al Qaeda, or or the Revolutionary Guard.
NEUT12|And at the end of the day, if it ever got big enough to be substantial, anariel medium of exchange.
NEUT13|How could the regulators so focus as they are on anti money laundering?
NEUT14|And by the way for good reason.
NEUT15|Going back to you know 911.
NEUT16|We found out that following the money is the way you can anticipate and maybe prevent certain crimes.
NEUT17|And of course everybody talks about, you know the illicit use of Bitcoin if you cannot monitor who's getting paid in the financial system, how can the regulators do we want to do we want that to work out well over the long term?
NEUT18|Now?
NEUT19|This could you know, like a lot of things, this could be workable, but it will undermine the Freedom and Liberty and and kind of lack of.
NEUT20|Lack of transparency that people like about it in the 1st place.
NEUT21|So that's the conundrum that Bitcoin will have to deal itself out.
NEUT22|If I were regulator, I'd be, you know, I would be kind of hyperventilating at at the success of it at the moment, not to be arming myself to deal with it.
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
