NEUT2|So First off, if you go ahead and bring up their one month chart they have been partaking in this entire market sell off.
BULL3|They were up to $60.00 a share.
BEAR4|They are now down about 23% from those highs, but what caused the stock to go up 11% on the day?
NEUT5|And we're going to look at that right now.
BULL6|Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker Neo were trading higher on Thursday morning after a Wall Street analyst initiated coverage of the company with a bullish note and a new note released after the US markets closed on Wednesday.

BULL8|Rakesh wrote that Neo is quote a leader and innovator in the upscale electric vehicle segment in China, which in turn is the largest global market for electric vehicles.
NEUT9|The analyst sees the companies.
BULL10|Upscale offerings which can have a lower upfront price than rivals if the buyer option for Neos battery subscription service provide a key differentiator from electric vehicle peers, Rakesh thinks Neo has a significant upside ahead as it expands into China.
NEUT11|It would.
NEUT12|It enters the European market later this year and that's what I want you guys to focus on.
NEUT13|Neo is currently just a Chinese company, however they do have plans to expand into Europe and if they do this, they are setting themselves up.
NEUT14|For worldwide exposure in an EV market now during meals, fourth quarter earnings call on March 1st, CEO William Bindley confirmed that Neo plans to begin sales in Europe sometime in the second half of 2021.
BULL15|The companies hinted that its European sales will begin in Norway, which has the highest rate of EV adoption in the world.
NEUT16|Yeah, so this Doc has a lot of good things going for an if we bring back their chart, they're currently trading for $46.
NEUT17|If they get back up.
BULL18|"To $60.00, I mean that is a significant move to the upside that is a 30% move to the upside, and it could only go up further from there in my mind, because Neo, I think is on the verge of doing a lot of exciting things as they move into Europe, and as they continue to expand across the world, so Neo is definitely a stock that I'm excited about and should also be on your radar as well."""
