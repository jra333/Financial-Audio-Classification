BEAR0|"""Jim, the reviews for the iPhone 12 starting to filter out here."
BEAR1|The Wall Street Journal Joanna Stern, saying the speeds will knock your masks off as we say in 2020.
NEUT2|The bad news is to get those speeds.
NEUT3|You basically need to locate a high speed tower stand right next to it and don't move.
NEUT4|That's going to be the story of 5G in these early innings.
NEUT5|Well, I mean, yeah, look, I'd rather be early as long as the technology holds up and you've got these companies that are all bidding.
NEUT6|Remember when John Ledger argued specifically?
BULL7|That we're going to be able to build out 5G fast and everyone else I. I think you can build out five G David within the lifetime of this phone.
BULL8|I think you'll have substantial build out five G, especially because the company is certainly advertising.
NEUT9|I mean, they're not going to get their advertising broad rollout and you don't get it, then you're going to port to another company.
NEUT10|That's true.
NEUT11|It's going to be awhile though.
NEUT12|I mean, let's not.
NEUT13|Let's not mislead people to think that to the point that was made that Carl just read.
NEUT14|I mean, yeah, you want to.
NEUT15|Stand next to a tower.
NEUT16|You're going to get great speeds, but more towers you have more power symbol to us during our daily life.
NEUT17|The way we're accustomed to using our phones, I think it's going to be a little while.
NEUT18|I think the again, the enterprise you're going to see the use of 5G a lot of chips that are going to be things that are going automotive's that are going to be able to be used but within a manufacturing facility or in all sorts of different ways that may be sort of earlier applications, but in time it's going to happen eventually.
NEUT19|We are going to be talking.
NEUT20|About a broadband wireless product in the home via 5G.
NEUT21|Essentially I like the president flashes key to what we talked to call.
NEUT22|Still called cable.
NEUT23|Flashy stainless steel case.
NEUT24|I like Nucor here ahead of the quarter.
NEUT25|You like Nucor because they make the Case No, but I like steel.
NEUT26|Nucor Steel Company, the largest steel company in America.
BULL27|Yes, report this week could be good court OK Alright.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
