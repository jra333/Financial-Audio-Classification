NEUT0|"""You have teledoc on tonight."
BEAR1|Tell us on Teladoc's down 20% in a month.
BEAR2|Zooms down 30.
BEAR3|Well look zoom is at 50 times sales OK there are some stocks that got overheated and I know that's absolutely true like John says, but there are other companies like Teledoc that arresting and now a lot of people feel that there's too many companies that are in the teledoc business.
NEUT4|But remember they also that you know they're not just that anymore.
NEUT5|They're also how to beat diabetes, how to cope with diabetes, how to cope with hypertension.
NEUT6|They have done a lot to be able to make them thin men.
NEUT7|Steph Fintech never quit.
NEUT8|How about thin Med?
NEUT9|What do you think?
NEUT10|I mean, obviously the trend is there and again total addressable market.
BULL11|They're they're huge and I agree there is room for all of the players for sure, but there are valuations are pretty high in this.
NEUT12|You know you have to either stick with him, stay patient on on them for the long haul, or be prudent like you taught me, trim a little bit here and then when they do pull back then you can kind of reload if you will.
NEUT13|But I do think yes.
NEUT14|I mean medtech, thin, Med, anything health care at this point to me is also very very attracted me the most.
NEUT15|Cost is work.
NEUT16|How about the cheapest in 30 years?
BEAR17|I mean yesterday we had just the bottom fall out because of pill pack an.
NEUT18|Is anyone here willing to step up and say that Walgreen, CVS or even good RX?
NEUT19|Are buys anybody?
NEUT20|Well, anybody else anybody raising their hand multiples just?
NEUT21|However you know, you know you know who Jim is is standing up and saying that health care is a really good buy right now.
NEUT22|But besides cost and you as you look at these stocks is Warren Buffett and the guys at Berkshire Hathaway because they bought the drug stocks Pfizer and Merck and ABB vie.
NEUT23|And some of these other names are trying to remember off the top my head, which exactly the ones they were.
NEUT24|But what about healthcare gym as a space to look at?
NEUT25|Right now I have to go with these valuations by remember.
NEUT26|When Bill Clinton went to Rahway, right next to Doctor Vagelos, who's the unbelievable CEO of Saint Mark and decided that Saint Mark was worth was worth a lot less, and that whole industry was going to be just crushed.
NEUT27|We are in a period when people think this industry is going to be crushed and I'm looking at McKesson.
NEUT28|I mean, yesterday they took apartment kissing.
NEUT29|Is it 9 times earnings now?
NEUT30|But McKesson is distributing the vaccine.
NEUT31|UPMC Mckesson's integral to the health care system.
NEUT32|I don't think that that's a mistake not to buy.
NEUT33|I think that's a really interesting stock, and I think that it's hate it.
NEUT34|I think there a lot health care should hate it, but look at United Health.
NEUT35|See that thing go up yesterday when it's so hated.
NEUT36|I want hated.
BEAR37|I like hate it.
NEUT38|Joe.
NEUT39|Completely agree technology is coming for healthcare in terms of disruption.
NEUT40|It's the next sector in which you will see price transparency which is clearly missing in the sector day like today Thermo Fisher.
BEAR41|That's down significantly, I think it's now $15 as I look at right now, pressing towards its 50 day moving average, I'd step in.
NEUT42|I'd buy it there and I just might do it myself later on in the day.
BULL43|But I agree with Jim, I think health Care provides a tremendous opportunity when looking at both growth and value.
BEAR44|I think the health care story unfortunately was misplaced earlier in the year.
NEUT45|It was all about biotechs.
NEUT46|"There's way more to the health care story than that, and that, along with the industrial sector, I think is going to benefit from technology."""
