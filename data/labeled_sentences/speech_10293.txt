BEAR0|"""Look, I think that the gold run is a combination yes of central banks printing money, but also a pessimistic view about what's going to happen with covid."
NEUT1|The stock market is a much more optimistic view of what happens with kovid.
NEUT2|The more we tried out CEOs who are very excited about their vaccine.
NEUT3|The more people just say you know what this is going to end and at the same time we got just a huge springboard 'cause of all the money that is being that is being printed so things will be good.
NEUT4|David, I've never seen a moment where you have a coiled spring of good news happens.
NEUT5|But if we don't get a vaccine, just get ready for another one of these things in a couple of months.
NEUT6|Well, I mean we're looking right now at the board there where we're showing Moderna and the progress gym that they have made towards a vaccine.
NEUT7|The news this morning of course is that company is moving into phase 3A phase three trial.
NEUT8|30,000 people will be a part of that trial.
BULL9|That would certainly seem to be a continuation of what has been positive news from Moderna and any number of other companies.
NEUT10|Many far larger and more experience in that one in terms of them moving towards a vaccine.
NEUT11|But I continue to be concerned.
NEUT12|Of the length you cannot cut short a phase three because you have to have enough people who are exposed to the illness to be able to make a case that this things better than far than the placebo.
NEUT13|And I think that in order to do that you have to have 30,000 J&J, 30,000 Pfizer, 30,000 from Moderna.
NEUT14|We've got a lot of companies and that don't forget the government likes Nova Vax.
NEUT15|Who the heck knows where that's going to come out?
NEUT16|But you have a lot of people walking around trying to doctors trying to figure out, geez.
NEUT17|Did they get Covid or did they not get cold, but it's not a simple case.
NEUT18|You don't just say, hey, look at this man.
NEUT19|These people didn't get covid over a couple of weeks.
NEUT20|It's going to take a long time now.
NEUT21|"I don't know if people really were really ready for how long it's going to take."""
