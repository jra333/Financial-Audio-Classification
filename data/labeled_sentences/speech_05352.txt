NEUT2|This is not financial advice but had budget smash the like and subscribe button and check out the links in the description for free Bitcoin and free cryptocurrency on Coinbase.
NEUT3|This stock right here in my opinion is going to be valued around 30 to 50 to $70.00 in the next two to five years time because 3D printers are not actually very useful at the moment if you think.
NEUT4|About the current global situation, but.
NEUT5|With technology going forward, I think it will be a very very, very good play and I think that companies like Nano Dimension the train or training at $8.00 will be very actually useful in our portfolio in the future when they will be trading their own $40 and we will have a 5X reader in our portfolio like a pillar that keeps our portfolio from the green always soon.
NEUT6|That's my price prediction for an Indium.
BULL7|I'm very bullish in it, I'm waiting for it to finish the W. And to take out some profits because I'm planning to add on the positions while is going up.
