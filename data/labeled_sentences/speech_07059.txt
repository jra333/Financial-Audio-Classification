BULL0|"""Spent a lot of cheering about this rally."
BEAR1|Maybe too much cheering.
NEUT2|It's my bottom mutation.
NEUT3|I'm still pushing for pro bono.
NEUT4|I think it could happen 1000.
NEUT5|Why not look?
NEUT6|There's been a lot of talk about this rally.
NEUT7|A lot of talk about the next bull market is a coming.
NEUT8|Has there been too much cheering Spencer Jacob Hour ahead of the tape columnist is here.
NEUT9|Today is what you were writing about.
BEAR10|Today is been a lot of people throwing out numbers about mutual fund flows.
NEUT11|All that stuff.
NEUT12|What it all means.
NEUT13|What does it all mean?
NEUT14|Well, you know what I looked at specifically was mutual fund flows are very, very closely watched.
NEUT15|I mean they tell you what retail investors are doing, and I think that they're both sides of the argument.
BEAR16|The bullish and bearish sides are inferring a little bit too much of the numbers.
NEUT17|On the one hand, you look at when retail investors start putting money into into stock funds, you get everyone and his brother saying there's money on the sidelines coming into the market.
NEUT18|Now that's just simply is false that doesn't.
NEUT19|That's not the way that the market works, I mean.
NEUT20|There's money on the sidelines, you know.
NEUT21|If I buy some stock from you then you have money and then you're not sure the sidelines.
NEUT22|There's no, there's no such thing as money hands so much.
NEUT23|Well this much but money changes hands every day in the market.
BEAR24|So what is happening is that people are willing to accept a lower return or to accept more risk or accept a lower return from from stocks because they're sick of earning nothing and money markets and getting very low bond yields.
NEUT25|And that may be happening.
NEUT26|But that doesn't really represent the flow of money.
NEUT27|You can't look at mutual fund flows.
NEUT28|And really draw conclusions from that.
NEUT29|On the other hand, there are people who are bearish or saying look at this you know.
BULL30|Last month we had the largest flow into equity mutual funds.
BULL31|Ever, and it was significantly higher than the previous record, which was February 2000 G One month later on the surface of it, though, that sounds pretty stunning.
NEUT32|It sounds pretty stunning.
NEUT33|I mean, January is a big month for reallocation.
BEAR34|I'm not saying that it's a good sign, you know it's compared to the other to the the the bullish argument about money on the sidelines, which makes no sense at all.
NEUT35|It does make some sense to look at the market and say, well, retail investors are are now putting a lot of money into stocks, because historically retail investors.
BEAR36|Are very bad investors.
BEAR37|They write their timing is bad.
NEUT38|You know if you look at, you know Dalbar and others have done studies where the typical investor in mutual funds lags the market by four or five percentage points with a huge huge difference over many years.
BEAR39|So their timing is bad.
NEUT40|But the one month data doesn't tell you that much.
NEUT41|Because if you look at last year or the year before or the day before that, on average you had outflows almost every single month had outflows from stock fund.
NEUT42|So it's not like this has been building up for a long time, especially.
NEUT43|What conclusion are you drawing?
NEUT44|From everything you're seeing right now, the conclusion that I would draw is that you the data.
NEUT45|It's too sketchy to draw any conclusion from at all the in terms of flowing into I.
BULL46|That's the point that I'm making, but what I would say is that the valuations at which people are getting into stocks were up 127% off the March 2009 low.
NEUT47|We're at a level.
NEUT48|Historically.
BEAR49|If you look at something like the Shiller PE where stocks have not had a very high return, they've returned less than 1% real over the next decade.
NEUT50|That's really what.
NEUT51|You know what I think people should be focusing on is that people are willing to accept a lower return.
NEUT52|It doesn't mean that we're in a new bull market.
NEUT53|It means that people are, you know, are willing to accept the risk you know.
NEUT54|If you had several months of very high inflows and prices going much higher, then I'd be more concerned about the flow data.
NEUT55|But I think it's too early to say that this is some kind of writing on the wall sign of a tipping point, alright?
BULL56|Spencer, Jacob, thank you very much.
NEUT57|Thank you.
NEUT58|"Could call him today."""
