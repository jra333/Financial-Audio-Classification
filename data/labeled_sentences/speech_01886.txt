BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to a cautionary global financial analysis."
NEUT1|Today we're looking at three decades of Coca Cola ticker symbol KO to fiscal year ending December 31st, 2020.
NEUT2|The just a quick note that the financing obligations to revenues figures are for the fiscal years 2002, 1010 and 2020.
NEUT3|Twenty that are used now.
NEUT4|Looking at these bars first, the first decade from 91 to 2000.
NEUT5|Is in the 1st.
NEUT6|Bar here the second decade from 2001 to 2010 is here.
NEUT7|The third is from 11 to 20 and then we are looking at the very last bar which is all 30 years combined.
NEUT8|So let's begin the first two metrics are in terms of 1 range.
NEUT9|I should say of 0 to one.
NEUT10|Alternatively zero to 100% and the last three metrics are in terms of cash flow as a percentage of revenues.
NEUT11|So beginning with the coverage metric here, we see here that in the best decade was between 2001 to 2010.
NEUT12|In terms of coverage capacity.
NEUT13|In the overall 30 year.
NEUT14|We see a coverage capacity of about 1%.
BULL15|Out of 1/2 percent, so not not too strong.
BEAR16|Next, the negative cash flow exposure it has was actually the highest in the first decade.
BULL17|It progressively appears to have gone down, which is good.
BEAR18|Overall, it has been about 7.8%.
NEUT19|Of total possible outcomes on this scale, again from zero to one or percent.
BULL20|Now, in terms of centrality, this has been actually consistent over the past decade.
NEUT21|At about 13% an over the entire 30 year.
BULL22|At also almost identically 13% with the second decade having been the strongest in terms of centrality.
NEUT23|Although centrality alone is not enough to to understand the whole picture of the company, that's where we get to the maximum acceptable exposure analysis here.
NEUT24|The 5% case and the 10% case.
NEUT25|Now what we see here is that given this 5% parameter.
NEUT26|Essentially, the company over the 30 year.
NEUT27|Has never been able to cover any level of financing obligations.
NEUT28|Given this, this exposure level requirement again MAA meaning maximum acceptable exposure.
NEUT29|The for the relaxing assumption of exposure to 10% you'll see in the 30 year.
BULL30|That it does improve to about 3%.
NEUT31|Of.
NEUT32|Revenues, but what this tells us is that essentially the company is not able to really.
BEAR33|At these levels, again of exposure, the company is not able to financing obligations a any higher than that now.
NEUT34|One concern, of course, is that over this 30 year.
NEUT35|That at this level of exposure.
NEUT36|The there's actually no level financing obligations that can be covered simply because the this is in negative territory.
BEAR37|It's a negative figure, so negative cash flow cannot cover any level of financing obligations, so that's a concern.
NEUT38|But at the 10% level, relaxing the assumption we do have some coverage at up to 3%.
NEUT39|In closing just a few reminders, the analysis is preliminary and estimates are approximate and are not forecasts.
NEUT40|Also see any references listed below the video.
BULL41|"Thank you very much for listening."""
