BEAR0|"""Facebook reported slightly mixed second quarter results with revenues in line with our internal forecasts, but below consensus it did beat expectations on the bottom line, but Facebook's guidance of margins trending to the mid 30s during the next couple of years as the company will be investing further in innovation, content creation and data protection was disappointing."
BEAR1|Total revenue growth was Hanford by slower growth in monthly and daily active users due to the implementation of GDP are in Europe.
BULL2|Which was partially offset by higher revenue generated per user while margins remained at impressive level levels.
BEAR3|They did narrow year over year as we had expected and noted in our previous reports.
BEAR4|In light of the soft profitability guidance, we lowered our Facebook Fair value estimate slightly $286 per share from 198.
BULL5|Now we're still confident that wide mode Facebook will successfully roll out new products for users and advertisers, and the firm can continue to more effectively monetize its users as it begins to offer more premium video content.
NEUT6|Not only on Facebook watch, but also on Instagram's IG TV.
BULL7|Plus, we think Facebook will realize return on its investments in content quality management and data security in 2020 and beyond, resulting in long term margin expansion.
BEAR8|Now with the stock down about 20%, we now view the shares as slightly undervalued when compared to our new $186 fair value estimate.
BULL9|"But we do recommend waiting for a wider margin of safety, likely in the 150 to 160 range before investing in this wide Moat and high uncertainty name."""
