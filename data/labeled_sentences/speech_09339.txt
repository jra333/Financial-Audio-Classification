NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol CN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to build context here, but overall very impressive move when you think about the fact that the price was flirting down around those lows.
NEUT5|But then all of a sudden closed all the way up there.
BULL6|That was a very impressive movement.
NEUT7|Now it does bring about the valid question of yeah, but is there any sort of true power behind this regiment?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves on a single area and that area is down here at $16.70.
NEUT11|Why 1670 so important?
NEUT12|And I'm not saying that this is what's going to actually happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT13|If the price were to come down in that area, behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT14|What would you have at that point?
NEUT15|You would quite literally have the price.
NEUT16|Having gone right back to where it was, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly Santa true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT17|Whereas on the flip side of things, and to be fair, no pricing.
NEUT18|Just go straight up so maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner.
NEUT19|Then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT20|Not what you have.
NEUT21|While you have a set of those right there, you have loads down there and if you envision each one of those stairs steps well hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's an in the game.
NEUT22|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress and in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined.
NEUT23|Again, as right around that 1670 ish Mark in terms of levels of resistance made initial level to keep an eye on going to be right up there at the $19.00 mark and then after 19 you'll want to keep an eye on that purple and right there at the 50.
NEUT24|Moving average.
BULL25|Currently valid it right around $20.00 an will call it $0.50, but overall very nice movement today.
NEUT26|Nice balance, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT27|So let's see how this one plays out on Friday 1st off.

BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR35|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
