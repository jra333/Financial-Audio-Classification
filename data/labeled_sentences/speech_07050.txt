BEAR0|"""Let's talk through this AM sell off first of all because this is quite a concern at the moment, particularly as it relates to the contagion risk for the rest of the region."
NEUT1|But what would you say?
NEUT2|The factors that have led to this ripple and crisis that we see in EM assets and currencies is this country specific issues, or are there broader macro issues at play?
NEUT3|I think there are two things.
BEAR4|Obviously if people are focused on the idiosyncratic issues, how badly managed turkeys been, what a terrible mess Argentina is.
BEAR5|But it's more than that because of course in the background you have rising American interest rates, and that's putting pressure on anybody with a sizable external deficit that needs to fund that deficit.
NEUT6|Which is why, as you say, it spread to India.
NEUT7|It spread to Indonesia in the region, and the good news for Asia is there aren't many countries that have a big funding requirement.
BULL8|Indonesia is really the only one and they've tried to stay ahead of the markets by raising interest rates.
NEUT9|'s only been partly effective.
NEUT10|How are you assessing the contagion risk then?
NEUT11|We think the contagion risk is going to be there because you're going to have interest rates in America.
BULL12|Keep going up and so that's going to broaden the pressure on emerging markets.
NEUT13|So of course, what can you do?
NEUT14|All you can really do is trying to manage your economy prudently.
NEUT15|Try to manage the imbalances.
NEUT16|Try to keep the faith of the markets.
NEUT17|But of course market sentiment can change very quickly and economic reform tends to be fairly slow moving change so it's tough for these countries.
NEUT18|So let's talk through some of the other I guess.
NEUT19|Country specific issues as well.
NEUT20|When you look at the peso, for example.
BEAR21|Indeed, one of the world's worst performing currencies.
BEAR22|Right now down about 60% against the dollar so far this year we've seen the government introduce an export tax and spending cuts, but do you think that's going to be enough to stop the bleeding?
NEUT23|And what more can be done?
NEUT24|It still seems to be reasonably half hearted now 'cause the other problem is President Macri saying we know this isn't a great tax.
NEUT25|We know it's not a great measure but please bear with us which doesn't really fill you with confidence in terms of the persistence of the commitment to these type of changes.
BEAR26|So I think the markets view it as half hearted and as a result not satisfied.
NEUT27|What role do you think the IMF is going to play here?
BULL28|And if we did see additional funds coming from the IMF wouldn't that represent just short term gain?
NEUT29|Long term pain?
NEUT30|I suppose the hope is the IMF.
NEUT31|Is the outside agent of change, so Macri says we don't really want to do these reforms.
BEAR32|We know it's going to be painful.
NEUT33|However, the IMF told we have to and it gives him a bit of a cover.
NEUT34|I think that's the way it's been used in the past.
NEUT35|A couple of doing things which are politically difficult and of course with elections approaching not too far away in Argentina matches trying to balance that need for popularity with the need for doing something about this currency crisis they have.
