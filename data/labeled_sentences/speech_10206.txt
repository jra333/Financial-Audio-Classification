NEUT0|"""It actually view this is more of a defensive thing by JP Morgan versus offensive and the reason for that is because square."
NEUT1|If you remember, Square is basically a story of two ecosystems.
NEUT2|One is the salary consistent, which is what JP Morgan is going after, but the other is the cash app ecosystem which is sort of the ultimate nubank.
NEUT3|And what I think is happening is square is seeing the average revenue per users for the banks being 3 to $500 versus its own average revenue per user for $45.00.
NEUT4|And they're saying hey we can take a peek.
NEUT5|Buy out of that, and I think the JP Morgan's of the world are saying hey, you know we have to be defensive here and we have to go after some squares business because we think that our core consumer banking is going to be threatened down throat.
BEAR6|I mean listen, I take your point and square shares are down 3 1/2 percent today, so it's not like their investors are totally shrugging this off.
NEUT7|Can square count on the cash app though?
NEUT8|If it starts to find small businesses peeling away at the margin to use the Chase technology instead?
NEUT9|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT10|So I actually don't think that a lot of that is that the threat is actually 2 square specifically.
BEAR11|There's a lot of other players in the industry which has inferior technology and are basically are the biggest sort of the threat is bigger to them than it is to square itself.
NEUT12|So I don't think that the overall people like to associate the JPMorgan or the Chase announcement today was square.
NEUT13|But I think I actually think even on the point of sale system, this square point of sale is less threatened from the cash app perspective the skies.
NEUT14|The limit, right?
NEUT15|If you think about the average revenue per user?
NEUT16|Going up and up and up over time, so that is sort of the engine of growth for revenue for Square, so I think even if there is a little bit of sort of threat from JP Morgan side, this is not not going to be felt very much overall in the bigger picture.
BEAR17|So you're saying that this chase move maybe threatens companies more like Verifone or those who are kind of provide that point of system technology.
NEUT18|I'm also curious what you make about this announcement by PayPal that it's going to accept cryptocurrency today.
NEUT19|Obviously shares a bit core shares of Bitcoin.
BULL20|Bitcoin itself is rallying.
NEUT21|In result, but what what could this do for PayPal, do you think?
NEUT22|Yeah, I'm saying look welcome to the club, right?
BULL23|And mean Square and we like both PayPal and Square, but Square has been offering, you know cryptocurrency trading for, you know over two years now and it's been a big success.
NEUT24|And they're not really using it to make money.
BULL25|They're not making real any real profit off of it, so I think it's a very good positive for PayPal.
NEUT26|I think it's a welcome to the club and you know, understanding that the 120 or so million users are both Venmo and PayPal.
NEUT27|You could do a lot more things of things with them, and crypto is just one thing that they're doing.
NEUT28|You know, by now, pay later.
NEUT29|Basically, they're offering they're getting also into banking as a service, but it almost feels like they're getting to it after square.
BULL30|So Square is sort of the thought leader there, and they're doing sort of, you know, I want to be there as well, but I mean this is a great move by them and I think will be very successful.
NEUT31|Alright Dan Dolev sticking with PayPal and squared.
BULL32|Thank you so much for your time today.
BULL33|We appreciate it.
