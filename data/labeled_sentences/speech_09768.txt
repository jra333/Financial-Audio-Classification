NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Thursday, January 21st and in this video I'm going to be talking about Football TV Inc ticker symbol FUBO.
BULL2|Today Football had a great rally.
BULL3|It's up $35.50 which is 17.74% increase from yesterday.
BULL4|As you know, football rallied up.
NEUT5|Back in December, all the way to 6229.
NEUT6|And then we had.
BEAR7|A major sell off.
BULL8|Went back up to almost 40.
NEUT9|And then then again the rounding bottom.
NEUT10|So you see here how it's being rounded off, goes up, goes down again and this time.
NEUT11|It broke out from this trendline here, as is this orange trendline.
BULL12|Looking at the RSI and the mag D we could see there both indicating a possible continuation in the upward movement.
BULL13|Also we see here a good green volume bar.
NEUT14|That's much higher than the rest.
BULL15|Of the volume bars for the past few days.
BULL16|So overall all the technical indicators are showing a possible continuation of the upward movement switching over to the four hour chart.
NEUT17|If tomorrow we open up above around.
NEUT18|The 3450 line.
BULL19|If we open above that price then we can definitely see a retest of this resistance line around the $40 mark.
NEUT20|Let me draw that here.
BULL21|So if we break out from the roughly the $40 price mark, then we could definitely see a possible rally up all the way to the all time high of.
NEUT22|Around $62.00.
NEUT23|If the resistance if the resistance line holds, then we could see a possible sideway movement that's aligned with this trendline, right?
NEUT24|Over here, the orange one.
NEUT25|Before we get it retested again.
BULL26|There are a lot of good things going on for FUBU, so I am bullish on football and I believe that.
BULL27|We will at least reach the $40 mark and get that retested, and if that breaks then we could see a rally back up to the $60.00 range.
NEUT28|I'll post an updated video before Monday.
NEUT29|"To see if we can get some sort of a confirmation in terms of the direction of the stock price as usual, thank you all for watching and see in the next video."""
