BULL0|"""Apple continues to be a pretty solid stock if you look at the volume, it's just pretty regular."
BEAR1|We're not seeing any huge spikes lately, and we're not seeing any drastic low volume indicating price weakness one way or the other.
NEUT2|So it's just kind of performing.
NEUT3|OK, because of that and that's not such a bad thing.
BEAR4|'cause we've had a pretty volatile market, so I personally wouldn't be complaining about it.
NEUT5|Just doing OK, now we do have this symmetrical triangle that formed and we do have a breakout as I always caution with symmetrical triangles.
NEUT6|The first few days of a breakout are sometimes a fakeout.
NEUT7|It's that fakeout.
BEAR8|That's worrisome.
NEUT9|Sometimes.
NEUT10|What happens is it breaks out.
NEUT11|To the upside or the downside, and then after a few days, it reverses course strongly on strong volume.
NEUT12|That is why I typically wait three or four days before I enter a trade with an indication from a symmetrical triangle.
BULL13|Right now we're two days out of the breakout, so starting to look pretty good, and I've generally been bullish on Apple, so we'll see in the next few days if it will continue the trend.
BULL14|"There is quite a bit of upside left, so it's looking pretty good, but I would recommend a little bit of patience to confirm that upside breakout."""
