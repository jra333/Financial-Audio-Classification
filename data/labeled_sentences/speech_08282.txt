NEUT0|"""Get ready, Washington politicians want to raise the cost of your gas, electricity, heating and during hot summer months your air conditioning."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL2|Will you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times?
NEUT3|President Biden will be signing that blowout spending bill of almost $2 trillion, most of which had nothing to do with fighting the pandemic.
NEUT4|And now Congress will be looking at a slew of tax increases as well as brand new taxes to lighten your wallet and pocketbook, one of the new ones that will hit everyone, especially lower income earners, is the carbon tax.
NEUT5|This exaction taxes fossil fuels based on their carbon content.
NEUT6|It's designed to substantially raise the cost of anything.
NEUT7|That uses oil, natural gas, or coal in its production, most especially electricity, gasoline and heating oil.
NEUT8|Of course, higher energy costs will raise the price of countless other products such as air travel, paper, food packaging and steel.
BEAR9|Since 81% of our energy comes from fossil fuels like natural gas proponents freely acknowledged that the tax will result in lower wages for consumers and fewer profits for business.
BULL10|But they say the tax is ascential to help reduce emissions of carbon dioxide to fight climate change.
NEUT11|Proposals vary in the actual level of the tax, but it will be an enormous revenue raiser over $1 trillion / 10 years.
NEUT12|That means less money for investment and consumption an the revenue cost doesn't take into account the overall higher level of prices that result from higher energy costs.
BULL13|Advocates, though, say the higher prices will push people to buy fewer carbon based products and give everyone a greater incentive to move to alternative energy sources.
NEUT14|Primarily wind and solar.
BULL15|The tax has a lot of support among Washington politicians, including some Republicans to lessen the damage done by the carbon tax.
NEUT16|Some promoters say part or most of the potential gusher of revenue could be used to cut taxes or send rebates directly to people.
NEUT17|But in the real world, the bulk of the revenue of a big new tax always always sticks to the hands of the politicians.
NEUT18|One example from all too many is my home state of New Jersey, which back in the 1970s pass a state income tax on the promise of lowering Sky high property taxes.
BEAR19|Today, New Jersey's property taxes remain among the worst in the nation and that income tax is one of the highest among the 50 states.
NEUT20|As for emissions, natural gas is a clean fuel when it comes to pollution, it should be embraced.
BEAR21|A super clean energy source remains unpopular.
NEUT22|Nuclear France.
NEUT23|As just about the lowest emissions for major developed economy, 75% of its electricity is nuclear based.
NEUT24|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL25|Thanks for listening.
NEUT26|"Do sending your comments and suggestions look forward to being with you soon again?"""
