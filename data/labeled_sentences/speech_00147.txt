NEUT2|Tell us what you're seeing.
BULL3|They sure are Scott.
BEAR4|As a matter of fact, this stock has had 10 separate occasions with bullish activity since the start of October.
BULL5|So very, very incredible amounts of volume coming in there this week.
NEUT6|They're going after 13,000 of next weeks expiring, so October 30th they're going after the 41 calls.
BEAR7|Those calls were going for between $0.75 and a Buck and a quarter stock was trading just over 40 1/2 or so Scott, so this stock has been absolutely on fire from $26 over to $40 there also buying 42 and a half calls of next week as well.
NEUT8|About 9000 of those trading next, we've got a Norwegian cruise lines.
NEUT9|This is one of those where we've had carnival.
NEUT10|Now we've got Norwegian.

NEUT14|I got a third one for you because I know we're going to talk some tech.
NEUT15|How about Apple?
NEUT16|Now?
NEUT17|Apple is an extremely active option trading stock.
NEUT18|It's almost #1 every single day.
NEUT19|Average is about 2,000,000 contracts today.
NEUT20|They're buying the deep in the money, but it's interesting.
NEUT21|So it's almost like buying stock, but they're going out in November, so this is not just an earnings play.
NEUT22|November the 27th of expiration date is what they're buying.
NEUT23|The 1:10 calls they bought an incredible number of those.
