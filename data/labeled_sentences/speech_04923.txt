NEUT0|"""What if we could see was unnecessarily real?"
NEUT1|So I want to share with you one thing that The Motley Fool in Australia are currently doing that is against the strain consumer law.
NEUT2|So look at this offer is called extreme opportunities.
BULL3|Your chance to follow along as we uncover some most promising and under the radar small cap growth stocks trading on A6 blah blah maker, Moon shop $1000 or more in profits.
BULL4|Yeah, yeah.
NEUT5|So what is I wanna show you?
NEUT6|It's a refund policy.
NEUT7|It says Please remember.
NEUT8|Motley Fool Extreme Opportunities is a unique solution, delivering a lot of value upfront and that's very questionable.
NEUT9|Therefore, we will not be offering outstanding 30 day membership fee back guarantee on this product.
NEUT10|So that clearly stating you will not get a refund.
NEUT11|OK now let's head over to a Triple C website which stands for the strain, competition and Consumer Commission.
NEUT12|Well, they clearly state under the heading no refund signs and expired warranties.
NEUT13|It is against the law for businesses to tell you or show you signs stating that they do not give refunds under any circumstances.
NEUT14|Did you hear that Motley Fool under any circumstances?
NEUT15|So if you remember or thinking of becoming a member.
NEUT16|And you wanna refund you are entitled Under Strange and similar for refund.
BEAR17|I'm just blown away by this.
NEUT18|So so it looks like I'm going to have to make it another video about the returns that they flash, you know?
NEUT19|Because I suspect the misleading.
NEUT20|What I think they're doing is cherry picking all the best pizza, and I was showing you those returns.
NEUT21|I think if we take a closer look it would show a completely different story.
NEUT22|'cause I don't believe there's any accountability for a website like Motley Fool.
NEUT23|But that's it for now.
NEUT24|Please describe and don't forget to hit the notifications bill.
NEUT25|Until next time.
NEUT26|Happy investing.
NEUT27|Was unnecessarily real.
NEUT28|This car was in the city.
NEUT29|"We were in the Sky where the sun shows baby come on."""
