NEUT2|PDS is a ticker symbol.
NEUT3|Now join my analysis in already guys.
NEUT4|So let me just go through it really quickly.
NEUT5|You can see this is obviously resistance.
BULL6|Price came down broke through resistance, created a new high here.
NEUT7|Price came down, didn't hold it the support.

BULL14|And I tested the support.
NEUT15|I'm not making this stuff up guys, it just happens comes up test the high.
NEUT16|I think guys that is trying to break out.
NEUT17|Of this high here.
NEUT18|Precision Drilling Corporation and it could break out any moment, I don't know, but my preferred entry would be a retest of the support level, so I'd like to see prices come back down to this level.
NEUT19|Which is around 22 fifty $22.50.
NEUT20|So here's my trade idea guys.
NEUT21|So this is a plan you don't have to follow, it's just information.
NEUT22|Entry point $22.00.
NEUT23|50 Let me just make that a bit clearer.

NEUT27|Dollars.
BEAR28|Entry stop loss.
NEUT29|Take profit minimum, take profit so there's the.
NEUT30|There's the trade idea guys doesn't mean you have to take it, I'm just explaining it.
NEUT31|This could be about to pop any minute, but by the look of it.
NEUT32|But if we can get it 2050 here, especially supported and it's a low risk traders, I always trying to get people in on trade with low risk.
NEUT33|Uh.
NEUT34|So if you act on it upon this information, that's entirely up to you and just explain my analysis.
NEUT35|I don't believe many people are talking about this stock, if anyone.
NEUT36|Also, there is God a nice trade idea.
NEUT37|An entry and exit I take profit.
