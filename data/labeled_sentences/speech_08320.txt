NEUT0|"""Joe, when Christine was going on it is April 2nd, 2021 to market was closed yesterday, but today we are off for Good Friday."
NEUT1|So let's hop right into it, looking straight at the SNP.
BULL2|We close at some record highs, record highs.
BEAR3|I expressed my doubts in mid February that things would tend to cool off and for the most part they kind of did.
BULL4|They tapered off but.
BEAR5|Make it hot was the end of March and we closed at record highs record highs forty 2063 we closed at forty 1987.
NEUT6|He recalled back in October where I have made the prediction at the market would eventually make his way to 4000.
NEUT7|Here we are so from October until now it's made his move.
NEUT8|So congratulations to anybody who's been involved in the S&P for that time frame.
NEUT9|Let's put a brand new mark.
NEUT10|Here on the chart for what our new level is, as you know, we've been doing this for many here, so here we are, boom for the Alicia, 39.
NEUT11|By 3950 there's 3950.
NEUT12|There we have the ultimate target of 4200 for where it could go to.
NEUT13|So that's SPX.
NEUT14|Let's look back at IWM IWM remember this is the Russell we got Palencia levels here and we see we test it out.
NEUT15|A few times here, 123 and we recently made his move higher, so I have a problem with how the market is moving right now.
NEUT16|Usually what happens is the Russell tends to be a leader in bull markets.
BULL17|However in this timeframe we had new highs for the SNP and Nothings following it currently.
BULL18|As far as making new highs, so I'm on continual alert for this to prove itself.
NEUT19|We have this area here.
NEUT20|This 20 is 2:30 that if it makes it here, I'm going to be on high alert to see if this starts to pull back.
BEAR21|If it doesn't then we have a continuation, if not, they will likely pull back to this 210 area.
NEUT22|So that is my prediction.
NEUT23|I want everybody to enjoy your long weekend.
NEUT24|If you happen to have the day off for Good Friday, let's go ahead and have some fun.
NEUT25|Relax, unwind.
NEUT26|Let's leave this market alone for a little bit.
