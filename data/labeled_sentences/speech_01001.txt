BULL0|"""Welcome back to bubble trading."
NEUT1|It's time to be talking about stock ticker VY GVF so Voyager Digital Ltd.
NEUT2|This is an OTC stock and we do have already 2 due diligence videos and two technical analysis videos out for this one so you can go back and check those out, but I'm just going to show you on stock charts, the daily chart so you can see just realistically the size of this move.
NEUT3|I mean, this went from under $0.50 all the way up to about almost 25 now, just in a couple of months.
NEUT4|So I mean you can just kind of see like the magnitude of this actual run.
NEUT5|But now I'll show you some levels on tradingview.
NEUT6|Before we get started as a disclaimer, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT7|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT8|If you're going to do any investing to speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT9|Yeah, so with that being said, so the daily chart on this one, starting to look pretty interesting.
NEUT10|You know me and Nick started talking about this one under 1550.
NEUT11|Probably like right around like 15 fifteen, $16.00 mark.
BULL12|And this last week was a really good week for this stock.
NEUT13|So a couple of things I'd be watching going into this week or just to see if the stock market stays strong and seeing how Bitcoin plays out because I know like a lot of the Bitcoin fluctuations messed with the Voyager token on Binance, which is BQX or on Voyagers exchanges Beach B GX.
NEUT14|So after we had this big move up, now it's starting to go sideways a little bit.
BEAR15|It's had a couple of long lower Wicks and anyone who's been kind of following the stock market knows there's been a lot of choppiness and volatility with the SPY, which is kind of translated over to the total market as well.
NEUT16|But this is a level I drew out in my last day video was that I wanted to see it kind of close above this like $21 mark on the daily.
NEUT17|So some of these Wicks touched it, but bounced right off.
NEUT18|So right off that support, I actually sold some in the 23's and re bought some back in the 20 ones.
NEUT19|And Full disclosure I do have a position in the stock.
NEUT20|So that's kind of what I was looking for in the daily chart.
BULL21|I really wanted to see this level hold and then lower them at the trendline hold and that would still keep this relatively healthy.
NEUT22|'cause if you want higher low to higher lows and then a third higher low.
BULL23|So as long as it's above the trendline, this chart is technically healthy, but for me I just want to see some sideways action, potentially a move up on volume over 25.
NEUT24|I mean, I'd be like the biggest bullish case will be just as strong volume candle that sends us right through 25.
NEUT25|But a little bit of sideways action or even a pullback wouldn't actually deconstruct this chart.
NEUT26|They still look relatively healthy, so me personally, if I was going to try to, you know, sell something, then buy back in, or I was going to stop out and then just wait for possibly a trendline, retest a couple of the levels I'd be watching.
NEUT27|Would be right around.
NEUT28|So my first love will be watching would be on the four hour chart.
NEUT29|I wouldn't want to see close below like 2250 so that kind of like the first spot to watch below that.
NEUT30|I wouldn't want to see a close under 21 on the four hour chart and then after that you know I think the trend line would potentially be possible to hit on the daily so those are just a couple of levels I'd want to see hold first.
BEAR31|So the bearish case this would be it loses all those supports, loses his trendline and kind of justice continues its way back down.
BEAR32|If the markets get really weak, the bearish or the bullish scenario would be a break of $25 on strong volume with the SP.
BULL33|Why Bitcoin the Voyager token all going up as well?
NEUT34|Just to make this, you know gain a little more momentum.
NEUT35|So if this video provide any value to you, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share and we actually do have the crypto currency exchange linked for this stock down in the description so you can check it out if you want to avoid is all about.
