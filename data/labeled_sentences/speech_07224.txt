NEUT0|"""Welcome to dance like trade talks and Jill Melon."
BULL1|True, you know, global markets Reporter at NASDAQ, with daily insight on the NASDAQ 100 index or the NDX, which is made up of 100 largest domestic and international non financial innovative companies listed right here on the NASDAQ Stock market index has been the barometer for US large cap growth and also one of the best performing index is over the last decade and a half.
NEUT2|Not to mention one of the most liquid index ecosystems in the world.
NEUT3|Joining me this Monday afternoon.
NEUT4|We have Christy Airborne managing director on Essex Market intelligence desk for an update on technical levels to watch in the NASDAQ 100.
NEUT5|Chris, it's great to see you welcome to trade talks and let's take a look at your first chart here.
BULL6|As we kick off, we're almost actually earning.
NEUT7|Season stats will be paying attention to going forward.
NEUT8|You know, time flies when you're having fun or staying at home, right?
BULL9|It's been a tremendous run for the NASDAQ 100 last few days.
BULL10|You still gains of nearly 2% earlier.
BEAR11|The index is doing fantastic and if you remember last week we talked about some resistance and support areas and you saw the 100 day moving average from the 50 day moving average narrowing in their band.
NEUT12|And that indicates that.
BULL13|Certainly there's going to be significant move within the product one way or another.
BULL14|This side it was very bullish to broke out topside.
NEUT15|The 50 day moving average stands at 13,184.
NEUT16|We broke through that at the end of last week.
NEUT17|On Thursday, markets were closed Friday and you got three big green candles one after another.
BULL18|We continue to trade higher from where we open it day after day and the openings are significantly higher than where the index closed on three previous days.
NEUT19|So what you're looking at is higher highs with follow through.
BULL20|On an intraday basis, volumes are good across the markets.
BULL21|Not great but good.
BEAR22|And what you're looking at here is an RSI relative strength Index, but still below the 70 or overbought level.
BULL23|We're at 62 right now, which if you take a look at the bottom of the chart, that's indicating that there's still room to run.
BULL24|Fires are far from done here yet and they're still looking to push this higher.
BULL25|Remember the old high back in February 13,879, and the way this is moving over the next couple of days we have a very good shot of getting there.
BULL26|You had some very good economic data come out on Good Friday.
BULL27|Nonfarm payroll port was good.
BEAR28|People are going back to work.
NEUT29|You know, the good news really is good news here, and it's reflecting within the index.
NEUT30|And with that, you have a lot of the underlying names doing very well on an individual basis, so there's a lot to be happy for here, and you have almost like a mini head and shoulders pattern.
NEUT31|Kind of forming on a day to day basis within the index here that screams higher highs increase our second chart here, looking at some of the.
NEUT32|Individual constituents participating.
NEUT33|Yep, like we said before a lot of good macro news, but there's also a lot of good very good stock specific news.
BULL34|Alphabet have a favorable court case today.
BULL35|Adding nearly 40 index points between the two classes of stock between Google and Google L. Microsoft had some favorable news as well.
NEUT36|And obviously Tesla, with the deliverables coming out this week.
BULL37|That right there is adding over 100 points to the index.
NEUT38|And then you have the other big boys right behind their Apple and Amazon and.
NEUT39|Facebook adding each as well.
NEUT40|On the downside, you don't have that many names trading in the red.
NEUT41|You've got only 18 names right now.
NEUT42|Trading in the red out of the hundred members between all the classes.
BULL43|That's a pretty positive day, and with that you are seeing the markets move higher as we talk.
NEUT44|We got about 4555 minutes left in the day.
BEAR45|This could close back towards the house today here.
BULL46|Alright Chris, appreciate the insight.
BULL47|Thanks for joining us on trade talks and thanks for joining me.
