NEUT1|But economists, especially cottoning to the number while markets seem to think bad news is good news.
BEAR2|'cause it brings in the Fed economist see signs of reduced economic growth.
BULL3|Ahead Hfe Jim O'Sullivan writing the data remain consistent with an economy that is those significantly but not to the point of recession over at Barclays.
BEAR4|They wrote this slowdown in employment.
BULL5|Lucky because household spending, which has been the bright spot in the economy to moderate janaf and doesn't think so, he's among the optimistic point to a high savings rate and low unemployment and decent wage growth to support their view, the consumer will keep on spending on in the US will avoid a recession.
NEUT6|Here's the rapid update numbers.
NEUT7|Q3 checking just one and a half for most of the quarter.
NEUT8|It's been tracking to the August data has come in week.
BEAR9|We don't have the September data yet, but it seems like the August data has shaved about a half a point of GDP.
NEUT10|Q4 looking at 19 we did two in Q2, and here's the estimates.
BULL11|Goldman, they're actually the top of the range right now of our median of tracking forecasts out there there at 2%.
NEUT12|Atlanta Fed 18 action that Ixes Barclays all at 1 1/2 and RSM at 1.4 in the name outlook survey just released today.
BEAR13|80% serious tilted to the downside, the average forecast he's a 47% chance of recession.
BEAR14|That's down from 60% in the prior survey.
NEUT15|Everybody have a great day which I have better stuff to, say one quite everybody have a great day 12 months, 12 months by the end of 2020 before we get nap.
NEUT16|I have one question was seven for this year 24 but together it's 40.
NEUT17|Did you hear bout than if in theory this morning I heard it?
NEUT18|I heard Jan Talk was was here in theory is it's all a consumer story and if you go to a consumer and you stand on the street and you say do you have a job?
NEUT19|What was it?
NEUT20|A better job?
NEUT21|Can you get a better job?
NEUT22|Same amount?
NEUT23|Yeah and if you lost your job could you get a job for the same amount of money or more?
NEUT24|And if you answer all three questions, yeah, making more than all of this is, you know, you know, is jam actually taking credit for that was.
NEUT25|That was crazy.
NEUT26|Do the survey you just said.
NEUT27|I think if you ask people, they'd say that we've been doing that survey.
NEUT28|Asking those questions for like 15 years.
BULL29|I'm actually escalate.
BULL30|Yeah, we actually asked feeling that they'd be look James great and he's optimistic.
NEUT31|Lee Ann.
NEUT32|I think if if he was hearing negative stuff from the retailers, I think he'd beyond that and or would be relating that to us.
BULL33|So I agree, the low unemployment rate.
BEAR34|However, I will say our All America survey did show a downshift right in the most recent quarter.
BEAR35|Still not getting paid.
NEUT36|As athletes I mean, right?
NEUT37|I mean, except in California.
NEUT38|Thank you for that explanation of why that is so bitter.
NEUT39|That is very helpful because you're not getting, but that would suggest the California respondents would have been more optimistic.
NEUT40|You will not the case.
BEAR41|"OK, but this is being charged with that would really undercut your theory which is undercutting my survey."""
