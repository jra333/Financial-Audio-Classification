NEUT0|"""Welcome to the market minute he's watching in London on Friday morning."
NEUT1|Well here we go again.
BEAR2|Markets are seemingly on pause as investors await the delayed US health care vote.
BEAR3|US futures are slightly firmer and European stocks a bit softer as bulls and bears run over their arguments about what the action in Washington means for markets.
BULL4|Bears say that because stock markets rallied so strongly after US election on hope, Donald Trump can deliver his tax cutting pledge.
BEAR5|Any failure to secure health care reform shows his agenda is in jeopardy.
BEAR6|Some of those equity gains, therefore, should be pared back, but bulls argue that's too simplistic.
NEUT7|Healthcare is arguably the most difficult form to get done.
NEUT8|Perhaps the administration should not have taken it first, but it doesn't mean tax reform or infrastructure spending can't be achieved reasonably quickly, and those policies are more important for equity valuations.
BULL9|"They're also more important in terms of the economy and thus monetary policy, and for now it looks like the more optimistic view is helping stem the dollar's recent slide nudging Treasury yields up touch and taking the shine off gold."""
