NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Danya sent today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about Duncan but not Donuts.
NEUT2|Adjust brands who is still here and keep an eye filming this video because I'm feeling some kind of conspiracy theory and here it is.
NEUT3|First of all we have is this Logan up by the rumor sell the news.
NEUT4|I think that this move on a rumor it is some kind of strange thing because.
NEUT5|They're not actually moving like this on rumors.
BULL6|Plus a 15% in one day and a little pushback, it looks really strange.
NEUT7|And here you can see original post on New York Times.
NEUT8|Dunkin Brands is in talks to sell itself and go private.
NEUT9|And here you can read that their negotiate $8.8 billion cell.
NEUT10|With 20% of premium and now we're coming to conspiracy theory.
NEUT11|First of all, there is no equity in this stock at all.
BEAR12|We can see stockholders deficit.
NEUT13|Minus $600 million and you can see total assets $3.8 billion total long term liabilities.
NEUT14|$3.8 million but good will more than $800 million.
NEUT15|I don't really think that done can without donors costs $800 million.
NEUT16|It is insane for me this talk is.
NEUT17|Piece of crap I think.
NEUT18|And here you can see some error venue incomes.
NEUT19|It is a franchise if it is advertising fees, rental income, sales of ice cream only $22 million here you can see on Kofi and that their grow not really fast but the share price grow super fast like X2 in 2-3 years.
NEUT20|And we can see how they do it.
NEUT21|It is only on the buybacks, and you can see this on a good focus.
NEUT22|And it does not really nicer because they girls are dead too insane level husbands.
NEUT23|It's called now distress.
NEUT24|And if something will happen with their business as they stock can go to bankruptcy.
NEUT25|I'm not taking any action in this traitor, but.
NEUT26|I think that it can be some kind of a scam and you can see that it will be earnings in next two days as they can publish.
BEAR27|Like oh, we don't have any deals and then they will publish a bad earnings and the price will go like $270 or something like this.
NEUT28|It is a really a low chance situation.
NEUT29|But I think it can be interesting for some of you guys and I hope you wouldn't do anything crazy like buying put options because it is risky a little bit.
