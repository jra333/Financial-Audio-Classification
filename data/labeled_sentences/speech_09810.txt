NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
BEAR2|This video will talk about Apple stock and the stock recently has been trouble breaking above around 1:45.
NEUT3|And that seems to be the current resistance line.
BEAR4|And it went down like 9%.
NEUT5|I think.
BULL6|Yeah, 9.74% from the previous support.
NEUT7|Then it's trying to find a new.
BEAR8|Support line went down from the resistance and is trying to bounce back from the support, but recently we haven't seen that yet.
BEAR9|It actually went down from the current support and it's around here.
BULL10|Hopefully will bounce back soon and.
NEUT11|The current place would be getting some call options or just buying the stock.
NEUT12|In general for long term.
NEUT13|I'll get a two or three week out option either February 26th or March 5th.
NEUT14|Let's go to the 5th of March.
NEUT15|And let's see what kind of options we have.
NEUT16|So we can literally go between 1:25.
NEUT17|And 1:32 it should reach above 132 by the 5th of March.
NEUT18|I'm pretty sure that's going to happen.
NEUT19|So let's say you choose like 129.
NEUT20|It currently costs $325 for the bid.
NEUT21|No, let's see.
NEUT22|Yeah, 335I mean for the bed.
BEAR23|And it's down 23% today, so it's pretty good.
NEUT24|It's a pretty good discount to get in at, so if you don't have any Apple stock, just buy it.
NEUT25|And if you don't want to buy the stock, just get some call options and you should get a good return by the end of two weeks or three weeks and as soon as you get like a 20 or 10% return you can close that deal.
NEUT26|So as you guys know, this isn't financial advice, is just my personal opinion.
