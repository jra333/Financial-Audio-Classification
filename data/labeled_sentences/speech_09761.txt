NEUT0|"""Free trade here at followmetrades.com."
NEUT1|Our definition of free trade is when you're in this trade, a stock trade and the only question is how big is the winner going to be?
NEUT2|Not whether you're going to lose anything.
NEUT3|Heidi Jenkins and I'm the founder of followmetrades.com, and I've got an example here on Citibank, a trade that we just took in the last couple of days.
BEAR4|Now we're still in this trade, but what we saw was a big impulsive move up on Citibank.
BEAR5|After the election, results came in and we saw some real clear signs of a bearish correction.
NEUT6|We used our theory for lower, lower highs, lower lows and we got it short on Citibank at 5788 and our initial stop was at 6019.
BEAR7|At that point if it reversed when it hit the stop course we would lose and some trades do lose.
NEUT8|Now.
NEUT9|We took this trade on January 18th and then on the 19th we moved our stop because Price had moved dramatically our way.
BEAR10|Moved our stop to 5783 and we took 1/3 of the position off.
NEUT11|We took profit on one third position at 5690 and then on the 20th we moved our stop to 5713 and we took more profit on the position at 5622 and so now we're in a free trade even if this thing reverses and hits our stop.
NEUT12|We've got a winner and we're going to let this thing run.
NEUT13|We're using Fibbonaci retracement lines to predict where it's going to go and we think the midpoint is down here at 5469 between these two blue.
BULL14|For the Nachi retracement lines and it's showing every signs of heading down to the target.
BULL15|But again, it's a free trade because even if it goes up and hits our stop, we're going to be profitable.
BULL16|It's a winner now.
NEUT17|The only question is how big is the winner doesn't happen all the time, but it happened this time.
NEUT18|It happens a lot of the time.
