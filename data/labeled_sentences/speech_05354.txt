NEUT0|"""What is up you guys?"
NEUT1|Peter Carlo here?
NEUT2|Traders helping traders helping you grow your portfolio one trade at a time and right now we're doing an update video on Nano Dimensions, an MDM you a lot of questions about this stock and like I said in the Palantir video, if you guys have a stock that I talked about in the past and you want me to do an update video, just comment within the comments section.
NEUT3|I'll add it to the schedule for shooting and we will get that done for sure.
NEUT4|So first thing you can see is I have my fibbonaci lines drawn out on MDM.
BEAR5|We have fallen below.
NEUT6|You know, pretty pretty big supports as far as this retracement levels are considered.
BULL7|We broke through that 38.2%.
BULL8|Retracement broke through that 50% retracement and broke through the 100 day SMAP.
BEAR9|So the fact that we broke this price level of $9 is extremely worrisome.
NEUT10|However, one thing you will see is of course a stock is never going to just cleanly breakthrough support or cleanly bounce at a support you can see here that we balance perfectly off of this support and then quickly move right back over the 100 day SMAD.
NEUT11|And then right back up over this 50% Fibonacci retracement level before rejecting it.
BEAR12|The 38.2 straight on the money pulling down and then breaking support once again.
BEAR13|One thing that makes me pretty bearish on this stock.
BULL14|Is the fact that we rejected again today premarket NND opens up NDM was up about 5% and then we just couldn't hold those levels.
NEUT15|You know, buyers got shaking out.
NEUT16|Sellers started coming in the sock projected to perfection at $9 and now it looks like an MDM is going to move its way back to 7 and if we can hold seven, I'm probably saying we're going to hit 6 bucks overall, the only way that I would personally be playing an MDM at this point is selling puts down at $7.00 collecting.
NEUT17|Premiums with in the meantime and worse and worse, buying and being assigned those shares at 7 bucks.
NEUT18|So let's see if you were to sell some April 16th puts for $7.50 you'd make about.
NEUT19|Not really too bad.
NEUT20|$33 per $800 that you put up and the very worst you end up buying the stock at $7.50, but that is ultimately where I see it.
BULL21|Unless miraculously, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we can push back up over 9 hold 9 and then we could see a move back up towards 11 guys.
BULL22|Thank you so much for all of the support truly means the world to me.
NEUT23|The fact that we have up to 15,000 subscribers on this channel is absolute insanity.
