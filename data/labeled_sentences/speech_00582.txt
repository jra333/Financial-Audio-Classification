NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and in this video we're going to take a look at a long trade set up in AIG and we talked yesterday about a potential short in host hotels."
BEAR1|Alright, that didn't work out as of yet, but still below the trend line.
NEUT2|So as we've seen in the past, you know breakouts are being sold.
NEUT3|Breakdowns are being bought.
BEAR4|Fact is, the stock is still trending downward, and until it really breaks that 2075 area, you just want to say short host hotels.
NEUT5|Now, as far as AIG goes very similar.
NEUT6|Trade setup, but this one to the upside.
NEUT7|So first if we look at the weekly chart could see here that AIG is breaking out of a weekly consolidation, right coming through right here.
NEUT8|And you can see how I put a little bit of a higher base in at the top of this range.
NEUT9|OK, this four or five week move right here in the middle to end of.
BEAR10|March finally broke out and after it broke out, it really just went sideways.
NEUT11|So now we know we want to be long AIG because it's breaking out from a weekly consolidation, so we want to look for an area where on a daily chart it would make sense to get long.
NEUT12|So if we look at AIG we can again draw this trendline in to show that it is trending higher.
NEUT13|And go ahead and actually show this box.
BULL14|Alright, so now we have this breakout to basically all time, high or at least last three years, 52 week highs.
NEUT15|Volume has been increasing and if you want to go ahead you could take that position and I would put your stop right around here around $56.
BEAR16|Alright, basically down below trendline below this swing low and below the 50 day moving average.
NEUT17|So that's the trade setup in AIG again.
NEUT18|Take that trade to the upside.
BEAR19|As I said, the breakouts been.
BEAR20|Being sold into breakdowns, baby have been being bought.
NEUT21|Habibah been being bought.
NEUT22|I don't know how I how I did that one but have been bought.
NEUT23|Ultimately.
NEUT24|You know this one could reverse honest tomorrow, but I still think that is something you want to belong of rather than short and under 56 kind of changes that.
NEUT25|So that's the trade setup in AIG.
