NEUT3|If we change the chart into daily chart we can see it clearly.
NEUT4|Here we got another green candle is a very.
BEAR5|Police sign because we got a gap here.
NEUT6|Actually for the real body we can see these two bodies not continued.
BULL7|So actually that means a strong bullish sentiment in the market.
BULL8|And also we can see this green candle has well above the former high on here it made on the 9th of November, so it's a very bullish sign and constructive sign for Apple stock.
NEUT9|If you check the volume, we can see the volume is not too low, so this bounce back.
