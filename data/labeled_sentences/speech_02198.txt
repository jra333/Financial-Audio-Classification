NEUT0|"""Is skinny and a weekly top 50 welcome back is the 17th of February 2021, Wednesday, the day after we are at #16 Cosmos Super Ticker at home, four at home against busy."
NEUT1|We like what we see.
BULL2|This is a rally coming in four at home.
BULL3|We are rising and we really broken the skinny pink line.
BULL4|Good, which means that potentially we could see a new trend change coming on four at home against BTC.
NEUT5|Here, we're still bullish Mercerizing very bullishly eventually it is going to stop.
NEUT6|This is not going to rise forever, right?
BEAR7|So we already moving into overbought territory on the RSI, only stochastic an eventually you're going to see a correction of sorts coming on four at home against PDC.
NEUT8|However, however, we're not exactly sure when that's going to come.
NEUT9|Are we going to get some sort of a?
NEUT10|Inverse Angeles right in the form of, yeah, look at his left shoulder.
NEUT11|We completely hate right?
NEUT12|And then we coming down for a right shoulder.
NEUT13|Oh this will be brilliant.
BULL14|This will be amazing if you got it however.
NEUT15|However, we don't really see it yet.
NEUT16|We would love it if we get a proper right shoulder and then maybe, just maybe, we could take a trip together for however, however, we are purely guessing at this point.
NEUT17|We could just keep rising higher and higher and this could just turn out to be something else so nothing much that we can do at this point in time.
BEAR18|We already moving to overbought territory.
BULL19|We are rising so high so remember.
NEUT20|In investing or trading, always buy low, sell high, buy high, sell low.
NEUT21|Don't do that.
NEUT22|So yeah, be patient.
NEUT23|Alright, let's move on to item against USD T. But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT24|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about at home in the comments below.
BULL25|4 at home against USD.
BULL26|T OK, I think that we are in a third wave wave, one wave two of three with four and then we get up with five, hopefully bringing us to 100 freaking dollars square.
NEUT27|$23.00 right now.
NEUT28|So $100 is.
BULL29|Not a 5X away right now we're anticipating at home to hit 1.618 and we've really hit it high five we have notice I got over here, we just said.
NEUT30|4.236 right it is at about $37.
NEUT31|Yeah, we're expecting $37 to get heat eventually, so we're at a number $23.00 right now.
NEUT32|37 is still another way this 57% away, however.
NEUT33|However, remember buy low.
BULL34|Sell high.
NEUT35|Right now we are quite high over bots on the RSI overbought on the stochastic and we are very overbought so you need to be very very careful about going to a trade too.
NEUT36|So the best thing is to wait for a retracement first or.
NEUT37|Arrest, right?
NEUT38|Do nothing.
NEUT39|This is like a arrest.
NEUT40|We roast, we rested and he rose again right?
NEUT41|So you gotta wait out for arrest.
BEAR42|If no rest comes and we keep going higher and higher, that's just too bad.
NEUT43|We will have to miss the chance, right?
NEUT44|The chance probably came over on here.
NEUT45|If you make a purchase around here then good for you.
NEUT46|But I don't think now is the time to be going in.
NEUT47|You have to wait for a continuation pattern to appear arrest or a retracement first before making any moves, right?
NEUT48|Imagine if you made a move right now and then things just started.
NEUT49|Retracing 2030%, right if you have $1000, your $1000 would have become $700.00 because you lost 300 in value, right?
NEUT50|30% is a lot of money, so yeah, be careful about going to trade tool, so being patient eventually the opportunity might it might present itself when we can't guarantee so we can't guarantee opportunities.
NEUT51|But then again, yeah, I don't think now is a good time to be going in now.
NEUT52|It's not buying season now is actually selling season so there you go.
NEUT53|That's my take four at home.
BULL54|Thank you very much for watching.
NEUT55|We enjoyed it.
NEUT56|"I shall see you in the next video."""
