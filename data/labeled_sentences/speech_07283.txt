BEAR0|"""Frankly, I'm surprised more suitors haven't come out."
NEUT1|I mean, given how popular Tik T.O.K has become, what do you make of all this right now?
NEUT2|Well, look, two things.
NEUT3|One, it's an expensive app, right?
NEUT4|Like whoever buys this thing is probably going to have to come up with.
NEUT5|I don't know.
NEUT6|30 billion plus dollars.
NEUT7|Two.
BEAR8|It's just an incredibly difficult technical transition.
NEUT9|The secret sauce of Tik T.O.K lies in its algorithms which are part of byte dance, which is going to remain a Chinese company.
NEUT10|And then you have this kind of all of the crazy politics around it.
NEUT11|This is just, you know, one of the most difficult transactions, probably in the history of Silicon Valley are David Faber reported on Friday, though that with the Microsoft talks that they part of the deal would be that they would take a year to transfer some of that coding.
NEUT12|The Fund, the secret sauce as you put it there.
NEUT13|Is that a viable expectation?
NEUT14|Could Twitter pull that off as well?
NEUT15|Is there anybody else when you consider the amount of money necessary, we all know who has the big cash hoards in Silicon Valley.
NEUT16|I mean, what do you think about that?
NEUT17|Well look there are definitely 30 to $50 billion somewhere to buy.
NEUT18|Tick tock.
NEUT19|I suspect it's more likely to be a coalition of groups if it winds up not to be Microsoft.
NEUT20|We know that Sequoia has about a 10% stake in Byte Dance Day.
NEUT21|Could probably help put together a coalition of companies or interests that could sort of take tick tock off bite dances hands, but I do think it probably is going to take a year right?
NEUT22|The idea that you could unwind this very large company in 45 days just seems ridiculous now I will say.
NEUT23|I also think ridiculous.
NEUT24|The idea that Twitter is going to buy Tick tock it does not have the money and it does not frankly have the competence to unwind that company from by chance and then integrate it into its own operations.
NEUT25|But that you know it comes down to what Tick Tock wants.
NEUT26|In that regard, do they want a partnership like you would have with Twitter?
NEUT27|And we all remember what they did with Vine, and I think they regret that they let it go.
NEUT28|Let it die.
NEUT29|Would they be a better suitor in that regard or go to Microsoft and let them do whatever the heck they want to do with it?
NEUT30|I don't know.
BEAR31|It's been like 2 weeks.
BEAR32|That's a 17 year old hacked into Twitter and stole like 20 infamous high profile accounts on the service.
NEUT33|I just really don't trust this company with with Tick Tock.
NEUT34|I think you know by chance is extremely angry that it has to sell at all and so I think they're going to be driven primarily by you know what is going to be the best financial outcome for their investors.
NEUT35|This could have been a company that may be rivals Facebook in terms of advertising revenue and that's getting chopped up into parts so they're going to be looking for who's going to give them to the.
NEUT36|The most money and it is not going to be Twitter alright?
NEUT37|"Casey Newton Virgin."""
