NEUT0|"""Before we get outta here, give me one reckless prediction for 2019."
NEUT1|We talked a little bit about the things I mentioned.
NEUT2|Facebook.
BULL3|I think Facebook ends up profitable here for the year.
NEUT4|Reckless prediction here.
NEUT5|Of course.
NEUT6|Not investing in Facebook for one year irons to iron the chairs, not investing just for one year.
BEAR7|But I think the stock had about 140 really hit some struggles.
NEUT8|Obviously.
NEUT9|We've talked a lot about them over the show over the year on the show here and written a lot about them.
BEAR10|I think I think that stock rebounds a little bit in 2000 and.
NEUT11|19 continuing to to figure out how better to solve the challenges they're having, and I think they're not done, they have some work to go.
NEUT12|And I also from a reckless prediction side.
NEUT13|Chris wouldn't be surprised if Sheryl Sandberg is not there by the end of the year.
NEUT14|I think you buried the lead.
NEUT15|I think that's the more I could be.
NEUT16|The more surprising not my stronger, reckless prediction of the two.
BULL17|So, but I think I think Facebook sees a little bit of a rebound in there.
NEUT18|I think they get some things right?
NEUT19|So it's it's hit these struggles and they've had some culture.
BEAR20|Clashes, I think.
NEUT21|Internally that's been a struggle and I think they kind of get that worked out this year, so Facebook can I go with a reckless and non financial nonstock reckless prediction for you Chris?
BULL22|Absolutely I think Ireland wins the World Cup of rugby played in Japan this fall.
NEUT23|They take down the All Blacks in New Zealand.
BULL24|They had a great 2018 and I think they have a shot to dethrone the All Blacks of New Zealand at the Rugby World Cup held in Japan this fall.
NEUT25|I would love to see that I can also think of a couple of listeners that we have in New Zealand who are very angry.
NEUT26|They might be we listen.
BULL27|There are phenomenal team.
NEUT28|I mean like they're like the Patriots, right?
NEUT29|Like there's just there.
NEUT30|I mean, it's so this is.
NEUT31|This is why it's reckless.
NEUT32|This is why it's reckless.
BULL33|There's a great year for them.
NEUT34|Last year in there in rugby.
NEUT35|In the wake of last night's college championship game, I thought you were going to make a prediction about the University of Michigan.
NEUT36|For I went there, man.
NEUT37|I mean, I just, you know, I just it's I. I don't know if hard balls there by the end of the year, I don't.
NEUT38|I don't know that but I was not ready to make that prediction and listen.
NEUT39|My wife.
NEUT40|You know, with Urban Meyer leaving OSU we she said hey, maybe you have a shot to actually beat Ohio State this year.
NEUT41|And so I was going to make that my reckless prediction, but I didn't go there somewhere.
NEUT42|There's an offshore betting outlet that has a pairs bet that they've just created and it's basically who.
NEUT43|Last longer in 2019 in their current placement employment, Jim Harbaugh or Sheryl Sandberg, let's bring in our man behind the glass stand.
NEUT44|Boydan Andy.
NEUT45|I love your enthusiasm, but the Irish rugby team, but I just want to say I don't think it's a reckless prediction to predict the winner of the Six Nations Cup in 2018 is going to win the Rugby World Cup 2019.
NEUT46|I don't consider that record.
NEUT47|I don't know.
BEAR48|I think the gap between New Zealand and the rest of the world is still pretty high, so I'll disagree with you on that.
BULL49|But thanks for the thanks for the.
BULL50|Thanks for the call.
NEUT51|That's like saying that's a saying.
NEUT52|OK, so the number one and #2 teams are playing in the Super Bowl.
BULL53|I think the number two team is going to win.
NEUT54|Yeah, real reckless.
NEUT55|I don't know man, I still think like that's like you know, nobody thought that Eagles were going to win the Super Bowl last year.
NEUT56|There you go, there you go.
NEUT57|Although I will point out Dan does have experience as a college rugger.
BULL58|"Yeah, he may know better than me, but I just think that I'm excited to see to see if they can takedown the All Blacks."""
