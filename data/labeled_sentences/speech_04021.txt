BULL0|"""Well, good morning traders."
NEUT1|My name is Mark and today we're looking at highly on.
BULL2|Well yesterday did about 50% of what I said I was going to do.
NEUT3|We, in a lot of the speculative stocks that are out there.
BULL4|We're seeing some positive price action on a quick side note, please hit that like button and please, subscribe number.
NEUT5|One reason why it's because it's free.
BEAR6|In terms of price, action slash decision points, we had a significant break above this resistance line and as soon as it broke up it ran up and consolidated.
BEAR7|It looks like we're going to be gapping up a little bit this morning and I could see, you know a run up to 21 and then that run to then continue till we hit this resistance line.
NEUT8|Now, like I said before.
NEUT9|Resistance lines about 2150.
NEUT10|After we break that resistance line and if we break it, which I.
BULL11|You know we're going to be heading up to around like the 30 area given.
NEUT12|There is some resistance in terms of, you know, 2550 and 2780 might think 2780's a little bit more.
NEUT13|But no election screen contested.
NEUT14|From what it looks like the immigrat.
NEUT15|If this were brain court will see what happens, it's going to cause volatility.
NEUT16|But you know, in a way it almost seems like the market doesn't care.
NEUT17|And.
NEUT18|Yeah, so this is where we're at.
NEUT19|Like I said, we broke up and I told said we would probably consolidate around the 20 year and that's where we're at.
NEUT20|I I hoped it would happen after the election and things were settled, but you know, I guess that's why charge are important.
BULL21|So yeah, we're up like I said.
NEUT22|Should be heading up to, you know.
NEUT23|I had, you know, sort of price targets.
NEUT24|Given this one night I would.
NEUT25|This one is more solid and it's actually the one that's about 2450.
NEUT26|The one is it above and has been staying above it.
NEUT27|But yeah, it's highly on.
NEUT28|If we like I said.
NEUT29|Restart get breaking above.
NEUT30|I mean even today you know you're looking at around 2180 something.
BULL31|Will probably get a quick run up to 25.
NEUT32|I said I'm gonna keep it short and sweet today.
NEUT33|Lot of things going on.
NEUT34|"Happy trading, you know what you think of that comes close."""
