NEUT1|I even saw a piece this morning, Jim, that argued that Biden's unlikely to replace Powell and give him a second term which would which would extend clarity for markets if you agree with that point of view, look, I think, did Powell be unbelievable?
NEUT2|Would be nice.
NEUT3|Pal Bradley is very much aligned with what Biden was doing.

NEUT23|One, everything I know indicates she's had a good working relationship with with Powell when she when he was on the board and she was the chair.
BULL24|Generally the markets as we know yesterday certainly quite happy with the prospect of a yelling at Treasury.
NEUT25|I mean, some say well, whatever happened to getting somebody from the business, but that's not going to happen.
NEUT26|No, that's just not going to happen, I wonder.
