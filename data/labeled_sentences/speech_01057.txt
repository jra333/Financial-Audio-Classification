BULL0|"""I'm sort of with you on the idea that if the market is moving higher that it may move higher, more in the first half, as stocks discount a better economic performance in the back half of the years where the profits are going to be going up as as Bob just showed."
BULL1|So you might expect stocks to do a little better than I want to drill on the on the on the idea that I think is implicit in what you say.
NEUT2|You have to be a more fundamental investor now in the market of the next 10 years than a macro investor in the market of the past ten years.
NEUT3|So I take that to mean that you can't just buy a sector.
NEUT4|Broadly speaking, that you can't just buy the market, broadly speaking, and that you'd better be ready to do some stock picking.
NEUT5|Am I understanding you correctly?
NEUT6|You're absolutely spot on and in our recommendations with respect to size and style, it bear fruit so far from certainly from November 19th at the beginning of the year were basically equal weight growth and value small men in large.
BEAR7|Now even though small cap stocks did very good in December, the growth in value trade has been actually essentially flat, and I think too much has been driven into growth.
NEUT8|Investor or value investor.
NEUT9|I think the days of learning about company management, cash flow product services are going to be a lot more too.
NEUT10|Investors versus formal a quantitative investing a lot have been set on your network today about some certain hedge funds.
BULL11|Posting a 20% return in 2020.
NEUT12|I think that's because they become much more fundamental.
BULL13|I know our conversations with institutional investors have turned much more fundamental relative to the quantitative and macro theories that actually have dramatically underperformed the last 10 years.
NEUT14|So again, I think we're going back to 80s and 90s investing.
NEUT15|When I learned the market and a lot of us learn the market where.
NEUT16|And companies were buying management teams were buying industries and were buying themes.
NEUT17|I think thematic investing is going to be very important on the bottoms up basis to pick good companies and hold good companies.
NEUT18|Longer term.
NEUT19|What would be a key thematic?
NEUT20|Issue for 2021.
NEUT21|Well, I think this whole notion of of the return to normalcy.
NEUT22|I think it's too easy.
NEUT23|It's too easy.
NEUT24|Tyler and I think you have to from a thematic basis.
NEUT25|You have to be pretty diversified across all sectors.
NEUT26|I think over the next three to five years.
NEUT27|I know that technology and communication services are by far our favorite sectors, along with discretionary.
BULL28|I'm sorry, but this year I think we're going to see a broadening out into some of the value areas.
NEUT29|But I think you have to play themes within each one of the value areas.
NEUT30|For instance, within financials, the number one theme is scale.
NEUT31|You want to buy scalable assets.
NEUT32|Within industrials, you want to be diversified with respected the domestic side of things.
NEUT33|I think you have to be really, really careful on just to lay that blanket of value overall, and I think the biggest call of all, quite frankly, is the stay at home.
BULL34|Stocks are going to do very good in any kind of potential nationwide lockdown.
NEUT35|Clearly you want to maintain your positions in tech and communication services, and when the market goes up, peel back a little bit, and when the market goes down like yesterday, you buy back into those, stay at home stocks.
NEUT36|I think that's going to stay at home stocks are they predicated on a nationwide lockdown?
NEUT37|Is that what you're expecting?
NEUT38|No, I mean I think this.
BULL39|I think there's a very good chance that Mr. Brian is going to be aggressive, and I think there's a chance of a 30 year.
BEAR40|I'm sorry.
BEAR41|30 year, 30 day lock down and it will be exacerbated with a very strong stimulus package to say hey, listen, we want to get things right in terms of everybody being safe and well, and that would only make a bigger stimulus package likely.
NEUT42|Now does that mean that you know that the Amazons and the Netflix of the world are going to be out?
NEUT43|Probably those are names and secular growth, and we want people to know for the next three to five years, I think they'll do very well under lockdown Tyler.
NEUT44|But as the market progresses through the year, you want to become more stock picking and more value in cyclical oriented.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
