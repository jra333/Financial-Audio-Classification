BEAR27|The economy is going through a down leg.
NEUT28|Now you have a stimulus bill coming in that will give it up.
NEUT29|And then because of what I think, Janet Yellen is going to do at the Treasury and Powell continuing to do and the.
NEUT30|The individuals that run Federal Reserve boards in Europe and Japan.
