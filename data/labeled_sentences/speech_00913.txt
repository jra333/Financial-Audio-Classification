NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm gonna be doing some technical analysis for the stock TS NPD Humble, Inc.
NEUT3|This is an OTC stock and will be covering this today.
NEUT4|So that being said, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT5|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT6|Everything I talk about is for opinion and entertainment only.
NEUT7|If you're going to do any investing, speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT8|So this is a follow up from the last video I made so you can go ahead and check out one of the prior TA videos, but essentially this is all about the short term, so a couple of things I was talking about was this web starting to form.
BULL9|So we finally got a break to the upside of this wedge.
BEAR10|Currently the price closed above the top of this prior red candle here in right around this resistance level at about 353.
NEUT11|So this is kind of level now to watch for tomorrow.
BEAR12|Oubreak of that and this could really get bullish, especially especially the volume starts to come in.
NEUT13|Just this look alone, right?
NEUT14|Is something I'm bullish on.
NEUT15|It kind of tried to break out here, broke out here, retested the bottom or the top of this trend line here with this week.
BULL16|And it's starting to bounce.
NEUT17|The only thing really missing on this one, in my opinion, is volume.
NEUT18|So if we start to get volume, this thing could start to run once again.
NEUT19|I'd say the next level after like that three 53354 ish range.
NEUT20|If it can start to break on volume to be about 375 above that, I really don't see why this test for dollars there is an open gap as well.
NEUT21|Right around this like 535 forty range, so that would ultimately be one of the big targets to watch for, but again we just need volume on this one.
NEUT22|So if I'm going to look now for what would turn this bearish, just some of the support levels I would want to see hold, especially on the four hour time frame here.
NEUT23|I would just say if you're taking the trade on this at this point, right?
NEUT24|One of the biggest spots now to watch would be a close on the four hour below this, like 325 Mark.
NEUT25|This is acted as resistance on 12345.
BULL26|Nearly five straight candles in a row, and then acted as support here.
NEUT27|So that's kind of the spot to watch as far as support goes.
BULL28|Ultimately, I want to see more volume come in even more than these volume bars here, especially on the four hour chart.
NEUT29|I want to see a break of this, like three 53354 range right here.
BULL30|And ultimately, you know I want to see potentially even this open gap around $4 tested on the four hour chart, so those are just a couple of things I would be watching for in the short term, but ultimately I am bullish on this one.
NEUT31|That being said, this is just my opinion.
BEAR32|If the market starts to get weak, this can always turn bearish again.
NEUT33|So always, you know, have your your risk levels in mind.
NEUT34|Trade your own plan.
NEUT35|Don't take what I say as you know this is going to happen, and again, just talk to a financial advisor.
NEUT36|If you can do any investing.
NEUT37|So with that, if this video provided any value to you, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share it, and if there's anything else you want me to take a look at, go ahead and leave a comment down below and I'll get to it.
BULL38|"Alright, thank you for watching."""
