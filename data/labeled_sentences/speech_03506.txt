BULL0|"""Welcome to Sterling stocks."
NEUT1|Shouldn't be talking to you about ticker symbol G in US.
NEUT2|I'm not a financial advisor, so do what you will with this information.
NEUT3|Be sure to let him subscribe if you have already, I really appreciate it helps my channel out a whole bunch so I'm not going to cover too much Marvel news 'cause we all know that is coming tomorrow.
NEUT4|Hopefully.
NEUT5|If not, we still have the 31st so just hang on to your hats.
NEUT6|We know what is coming.
BULL7|54 million volume today over our three month average of 35.36 million.
NEUT8|Now since we've had these big days.
NEUT9|Fun.
NEUT10|So still a lot of interest in this thing.
NEUT11|Uh, I would not.
NEUT12|I know I predicted fives earlier, possibly off a Marvel news, but I said we we we would have to hold threes off of pre hype.
NEUT13|Did not do that, so I would expect 350 to 4 range is what I'm looking for off of Marvel News.
NEUT14|If not, I'm not panicking.
NEUT15|'cause like I've said, this easily is kind of a long term hold.
NEUT16|Maybe take some profits here and there and re-enter of course so 14K followers.
NEUT17|I'll just mention this real quick on Twitter.
NEUT18|And we'll look at Netflix real quick, 11.2 million followers.
NEUT19|While we don't reach all those same groups that Netflix does, we're still pretty early in the stages, so just keep that in mind April 23rd.
NEUT20|That will be releasing the superhero kindergarten with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and that's probably going to be a pretty good show.
NEUT21|I'd say.
NEUT22|Be sure to tune in now.
NEUT23|I mean, it checks garage premieres, fall 2021, so that will be big for us as well.
NEUT24|I expect other news to come out with.
NEUT25|We have the Marvel news of course, and then they.
NEUT26|They've also hinted at that they might be talking to other people that they can't say much more than that until a deal is our official, of course.
NEUT27|So I mean, this thing is so new, I expect him to get more and more licensing deals.
NEUT28|Will look at trade for travel.
NEUT29|This is on StockTwits so in 2020 they were like basically brand new launch and stuff.
NEUT30|Lot of excitement for SHC checks you Roger announced but no no date so now we have a date.
NEUT31|Cartoon Channel has now established itself on Samsung an Apple ads coming in by kids.
NEUT32|Com superhero kindergarten begins being launched after two years of buildup and that's on April 23rd.
NEUT33|So that's being built up for two years now, an.
NEUT34|It's launching April 23rd, so keep that in mind.
NEUT35|Kids Com revenue coming onto books for GNUS, Leising Leising licensing deals will be announced for Stanley's universe, the 1st for Marvel tomorrow.
NEUT36|His guests there.
NEUT37|Guess I should say, sorry, checks garage, we already covered that, so let's see.
NEUT38|I'm just saying.
NEUT39|Sermon as this could be huge force might take profits at some time and then reenter.
NEUT40|Of course I'm going to hold this for a couple years.
NEUT41|I would imagine like I said could be the next big streaming service.
NEUT42|They could always expand their horizons, maybe not always to be a kitchen, but I mean I kind of like it just being just laser focused on kind of 1 area like do what you do best.
NEUT43|You know?
NEUT44|So yeah, that's pretty much it.
NEUT45|Like I said I have other gene US videos, pretty much covering a whole bunch of things about him.

NEUT49|So I'm working on a 2012 MacBook right now so just bear with me.
NEUT50|I know it's not the best sometimes, but yeah, be sure to comment your favorite Marvel character if you got one.
