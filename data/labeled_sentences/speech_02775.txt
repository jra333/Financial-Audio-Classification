NEUT0|"""The term emerging markets was coined in the 1980s."
NEUT1|It was intended as a more appealing way to describe fast growing countries in what was then known as the Third World.
BEAR2|But by the end of that decade, these emerging economies were still small in comparison to developed economies such as Germany, Japan, and the United States.
BULL3|Over the past 20 years, especially the last 10, the emerging economies have grown quickly, accounting for a rising share of world output.
NEUT4|In 2008, they finally overtook the developed world, accounting for more than half of the world economy.
NEUT5|If you include countries like South Korea that have since joined the ranks of the developed economies, and if you take proper account of differences in local prices.
BULL6|This growing clout is most evident in the market for commodities.
BEAR7|The emerging economies burned almost 55% of all the oil consumed last year.
NEUT8|Their factories and building sites accounted for 65% of global copper consumption and 3/4 of the world's consumption of steel.
BULL9|Their consumer power has also grown.
NEUT10|They bought over half the world's motor vehicles last year, including vans and lorries, and took out over 3/4 of new mobile phone subscriptions.
NEUT11|Developing countries will want self-reliant, but poor.
BULL12|In recent decades, by contrast, cross border trade and investment have soared in both directions.
NEUT13|Last year, they accounted for more than half of the world's exports, and more than half of America's overseas sales.
BULL14|Emerging economies have also become more resilient.
BULL15|They have amassed an enormous cushion of hard currency reserves.
BULL16|That insurance may have helped persuade foreigners to invest in their stock markets, which have increased greatly in size.
BULL17|Despite many ups and downs along the way.
BEAR18|The emerging economies cannot match the rich world on every measure.
NEUT19|For example, Japan, Europe and America still have few rivals in the emerging world when it comes to public debt, which averages 35% of GDP in the emerging economies and over 100% in the rich world.
BULL20|The economic weight of the emerging world is profound, but not unprecedented.
NEUT21|In 1820, these countries accounted for about 70% of the world economy before industrial revolutions in Europe and America left them far behind.
NEUT22|"Their recent progress is not then another revolution, but rather a restoration."""
