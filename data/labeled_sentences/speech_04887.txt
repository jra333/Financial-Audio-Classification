NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 9th of December, 2020 Thursday.
NEUT2|Sorry Wednesday that the day of the week jumped one day ahead.
NEUT3|We're #15 monero.
BEAR4|The ticker XMR for Monero against busy.
NEUT5|This is looking like a mountain range to me.
NEUT6|Mountain One Mountain, 2 Mountain, three mountains.
NEUT7|Yeah this could be a hidden showed us this entire thing could be less order big hit it could be getting a right shoulder here pub we could be slamming slamming down for Monero against BTC.
NEUT8|Things may not look good for a little while, but yeah, again, I don't really like.
BEAR9|This is very flat, so potentially we could be dropping lower for more narrow against BTC.
NEUT10|Is a very big.
BEAR11|Hidden showed us if anything, and potentially we could drop very low for Monero in the potential is there doesn't mean it's going to happen the last time we had a head.
NEUT12|Shoulders was over here and look at what happened.
NEUT13|We went higher instead of dropping lower we went higher so the wheels would be like OK, but we're supposed to go down in the other wheels who had other plans and it pushed the price higher and then the wheels who initially created the Henschel said no no no no no no.
NEUT14|It's select everybody back down towards the support line and then they started accumulating again and then I think.
BEAR15|More likely than not, we should be busting lower, anticipating us to burst lower for Monero against BTC, yeah.
NEUT16|If things were to be bullish, we should have stayed above this skinny pink line, right?
NEUT17|And the momentum would be towards the upside.
NEUT18|You could just see, right?
NEUT19|For example, from here to here.
NEUT20|How long did it take 160 days to rise from here at the top to the bottom?
NEUT21|How long do you take 37 days 160 days to go up?
BEAR22|37 days to drop so you can see that the speed is towards the downside.
NEUT23|This is so much faster than this, right?
NEUT24|So be very, very careful about going to trade too soon as you feel that Terminara could be.
BEAR25|Losing Satoshis against BTC, right?
BULL26|As we want to Monero against USD.
NEUT27|But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think.
BEAR28|Bonaero in documents be low for Monero against USG.
BULL29|We are rising for Monero and we still have a target for Monero at $170.
BULL30|I still feel that we are going to hit our targets eventually 170.
NEUT31|I feel like we will eventually hit it because things aren't bearish yet.
BULL32|Their love coins that have already shown bearish tendencies, but far from Monero we are still looking pretty bullish and we're still slowly crawling our way higher.
BEAR33|We already in a bullish trend for Monero against USD and we still are bullish and we still maintain our bullish trend for Monero and so we are still anticipating our targets at $170 to be hit with 130.
BULL34|There's still another 31% more to go for more narrow against USD were not particularly over button, so we could just slowly crawl.
NEUT35|Hello wake up so yeah, there you go.
NEUT36|Those are my thoughts for Monero because The thing is we broke up from a very nice inverse head and shoulders left shoulder, hip right shoulder problem.
BEAR37|We burst out and so we are anticipating it to hit at least $270 first before we see any sort of a correction.
NEUT38|If any correction would become so yeah, there you go.
NEUT39|There's my thoughts were right.
NEUT40|I guess I see from my Monero technical analysis.
BULL41|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL42|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT43|"Just see you in the next video."""
