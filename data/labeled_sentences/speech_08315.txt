NEUT0|"""No look, I've got to tell you."
NEUT1|Having worked with you guys, there isn't anything you don't seem to want to accomplish because you understand the importance of Health Care now I know will I met you through Marc Benioff, Mark and I both feel that if we only had the mass that people wanted to where we could really solve a lot of what is this bizarre cultural divide between people who think it's a political issue?
NEUT2|It's not.
NEUT3|It's a safety issue, but it's a style issue.
NEUT4|Can this conquer the divide will?
NEUT5|You know?
NEUT6|I remember traveling back and forth to Asia in 1998 and then after the South, the SARS outbreak in 2002 and then 2003 and four and five.
NEUT7|I didn't really understand why people were wearing masks because the Western world didn't really have empathy.
NEUT8|They don't really have context of what you know people were going through out there.
BEAR9|Now that we've all got hit by covid pretty hard.
NEUT10|You see why they continue to wear mask after you know the the SARS outbreak so?
NEUT11|I think people will continue to wear mask and mask like the Super Mass have other functionality.
NEUT12|I think you're going to be giving people an option like people wear sneakers and basketball shoes and no one and a lot of them don't play basketball that the same **** happened for mask.
NEUT13|There needs to be other functionalities that protect you like people forgot that shoes are protective gear.
NEUT14|They help your ankles out that help your feet when you're traveling on terrain that could.
NEUT15|That could damage your feet, but we've long passed looked at shoes as protective gear.
NEUT16|But they're just cultural items that we go out and buy.
NEUT17|The mass should have the same type of attention to detail, love and care to tour.
NEUT18|You're not compromising the aesthetics for keeping yourself and other people safe.
NEUT19|I totally create that effect will.
NEUT20|I am convinced that what you're seeing now is a belief that this is not our first pandemic.
NEUT21|There will be many more, but not her.
