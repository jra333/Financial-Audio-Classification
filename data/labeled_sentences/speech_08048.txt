BULL0|"""Good afternoon Mr Buffett."
NEUT1|Nelson Coburn from Silver Spring MD have one question.
NEUT2|I want to ask.
NEUT3|It hasn't come up here yet.
NEUT4|Where does the money set that comes in say from dividends and whatever other income that comes in the Berkshire that you're waiting to invest someplace else?
NEUT5|Is it get someplace where it's taking in a profit or is it just sitting gathering dust?
NEUT6|We we only have about.
NEUT7|Four or five commercial paper names we accept.
NEUT8|We're very picky about where we put the money.
NEUT9|All gets invested.
NEUT10|We do not have anything sitting around in the safer.
NEUT11|Anyplace else, so it's all invested.
NEUT12|But we do not get venturesome in the least.
NEUT13|In terms of.
NEUT14|In terms of.
NEUT15|Where our short term money goes so we only have like like I say, maybe four or five approved names on commercial paper, all of which I approve.
NEUT16|I mean, if anything ever goes haywire on this, it's my fault.
NEUT17|Right now we have.
NEUT18|We have maybe.
NEUT19|A billion and something in.
NEUT20|And should be relatively short term Treasurys and then we have a little extra in in some commercial paper maybe, but you will never see us reaching for an extra 8th of a percent on short term yields, and some of you may remember the fiasco in the Penn Central in the commercial paper market and Penn Central.
NEUT21|Around 1970 or thereabouts was paying a quarter of a point.
NEUT22|As I remember more.
BULL23|Than other commercial paper issuers.
NEUT24|And of course, they one day, despite showing a positive net worth, I think of a billion and a half or so they said they.
NEUT25|They had a lot of net worth, but no cash.
NEUT26|Turned out cash was more important than, so they defaulted.
NEUT27|Now the interesting thing about doing that is if you're getting a quarter of a point extra.
NEUT28|And you and you came over on the Mayflower, and you landed, and you said, well, I'm going to apply myself to getting a quarter point extra in short term money.
NEUT29|And you didn't make any mistake until you got to.
NEUT30|Depends central you would sign from the com pounding aspect you you would be behind at that point and I don't like a business that you can do right for 300 years and then make one mistake and be behind so so we.
NEUT31|Wait, wait, we're very picky about.
NEUT32|"About short term paper, but it is all invested an when it's large amounts that it probably will be in Treasurys couple of couple firms is commercial paper we take."""
