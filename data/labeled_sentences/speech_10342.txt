NEUT0|"""The bull market in Tesla."
NEUT1|It's real and it's spectacular bull market in the rest of the electric vehicle place feels way less substantial and once again I'm warning you to stay away, no matter how awesome it seems.
NEUT2|So tonight I want to go over the EV plays.
NEUT3|The other ones, the ones that everyone is so crazy about 'cause they're the next Tesla's special teams, because we seem to get a new one every day.
BEAR4|They are awfully hard to keep track of.
NEUT5|First, there's Nicola, that's that highly promotional, to say the least.
NEUT6|Fuel cell play with an electric trucking kicker and they come on TV a lot and.
NEUT7|The guys in my Skype, even before they come public via merger with one of these specs, I warned you away from this one every few years, speculators crowd into the hydrogen fuel cell names, then the stocks implode and the technology never seems to go anywhere.
NEUT8|With nickel.
BEAR9|I warned you that the stock would spike right out of the gate and then plummet.
BEAR10|That's what happened when we learn that Nicole was merging with us with this pack called Vecto IQ way back in March, the bubble had started yet and the broader stock market was still collapsing.
NEUT11|In response to the pandemic.
BEAR12|But as we got closer to the merger in early June, Vecto IQ stock took off.
BULL13|It went from $13.00 at the end of April to nearly 29 at the end of May.
BEAR14|At the beginning June, I warned you that this thing would spike it to the deal closed.
NEUT15|At the time it was trading, just under $34 and you had to sell it into the spike because there's no way it would last.
BULL16|Within a few days Nicholas Stock nearly tripled to an intraday high of $994.00.
BEAR17|For closing it just under $80.00.
NEUT18|Oh my God, that is one of those horrible pure wets that all the charges would tell you means it's the end and this one has been indeed freefall downhill from here last month.
NEUT19|Stock plus 55% value is currently trading just under 39.
NEUT20|I'm not hearing anything.
NEUT21|It makes me feel like that Nikola is anything other than ricola, like the cough drop.
NEUT22|How do I?
NEUT23|How do I see this kind?
BULL24|OK I figured the hype would give you one big move higher.
NEUT25|But beyond the height, there wasn't much.
NEUT26|There are the people who are going to Hector me endlessly in my Twitter feed, 'cause I made that rocola joke.
NEUT27|Nicholas got no products.
NEUT28|That's always by the way, a sub optimal way to run a business.
NEUT29|They're working on electric truck for next year, but the real plan is a hydrogen fuel cell powered truck for 2023.
NEUT30|In other words, most of the value here is in the idea the concept and that simply can't justify $25 billion valuation where Nicole was not long ago really was a 25 day or even a 14 billion valuation words right now.
NEUT31|Ideas per share?
NEUT32|Well, it's still not a spectacular metric.
NEUT33|As crazy as this market is, it still not buying ideas per share.
BEAR34|In some ways Nikola Stock was a victim of its own success.
BULL35|The big rally meant that a whole lot of warrants were becoming more available.
NEUT36|24 million words that let their owners buy the stock at 11:50.
NEUT37|Those warrants became exercisable couple weeks ago, and Nicole also registered 53 million shares owned by their private investors mean the stock market got flooded with new supply.
NEUT38|Thanks for nothing now.
BEAR39|The company just reported tonight and the stock got hammered in after hours trading.
NEUT40|I don't know what people expected, they don't have any products to sell yet, so why could they have any concrete orders?
