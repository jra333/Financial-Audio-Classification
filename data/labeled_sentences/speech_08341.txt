NEUT0|"""Good morning and today Wallpapers."
NEUT1|Yesterday was quite interesting how he ran up gapped up.
NEUT2|And then.
BULL3|Head for 19 bucks and then just came all the way back down to 1650 and then that's right, where we gapped up before we held above, it ended the close this morning.
BEAR4|We are gapping up.
NEUT5|And we're going to see what happens.
NEUT6|I feel that.
BEAR7|The overall market may be due for a pullback in sub capacity, but we'll have to wait and see, but I didn't say it already.
NEUT8|Please hit that like and subscribe.
BULL9|It really helps us out.
NEUT10|Type of content.
NEUT11|Going.
NEUT12|If we can continue holding above.
NEUT13|This 1630 area or start making a prominent trendline or staying above it online.
NEUT14|We can continue heading up.
BEAR15|But if the market signs of weakness, this could potentially have weakness and we could potentially add down, but we'll have to wait and see.
NEUT16|But this is the, you know, the bizone that we were referring to earlier, that how it traded up and down within this for.
NEUT17|Maybe basically the first part of July.
NEUT18|We'll see early July up until August almost the end of August.
NEUT19|We consolidated here so this potentially may be the range where we.
NEUT20|"Yeah, consolidate and move around in up until we find out about that USPS contract."""
