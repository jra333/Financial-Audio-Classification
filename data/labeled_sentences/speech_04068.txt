NEUT0|"""Hello from the Financial Times newsroom here in New York markets are an important juncture this week as we countdown to Friday's all important nonfarm payrolls report for April."
NEUT1|After a harsh winter, which is severely hit the US economy for the during the first quarter, we are now about to see whether or not the much heralded an anticipated spring.
NEUT2|Recovering the economy is about to take place.
BEAR3|Economists expect 250,000 new jobs were created last month.
BULL4|That is up from the average of 183 thousand for the past 12 months.
BEAR5|But is that really going to be enough to push equity markets to record highs and put some pressure on very low yielding Treasury bonds?
NEUT6|I'm now joined by my colleague Vivian Rodriguez, who's our capital markets correspondent for the FT.
NEUT7|So just how important is Friday's data?
NEUT8|Well, it depends on which corner of the market are you talking about.
NEUT9|Obviously, for bone investors like.
NEUT10|All depends on which kind of impact you're going to have on the 10 year Treasury note.
BEAR11|I mean, we've seen that because you have been so low.
BULL12|This has given almost like either in more borrow time for corporate boards.
BULL13|Issuance has been a very high levels and people have been very friendly market.
BULL14|So obviously if the report is a good report and we see the 10 year Treasury note moving higher, the question is, are bonds going to keep outperforming?
NEUT15|Is issue is going to remain that high?
NEUT16|Probably not.
NEUT17|Now the big key thing here for the equity market, of course, is when are we about to see leadership turned to the so-called cyclicals or the sectors that are economically sensitive?
NEUT18|And this includes financials, consumer discretionary, which is lag.
BULL19|Quite notably this year, along with technology stocks which are taking a bit of a beating since March, but it seemed to start to come back in the last week or so.
BULL20|Do you think a 250,000 jobs report would be enough to to sort of get those sectors accelerating?
NEUT21|Well, obviously, if the economy shows signs of a real pickup is specially in the job markets with potentially wage gains, price appreciation, so certain sectors, there are less defensive, right?
NEUT22|I mean tend to appreciate.
BULL23|I mean, people will start well if the consumer is going to earn more money.
NEUT24|Consumers going to spend more money, so maybe I should leave some of these very defensive, specially the banking and stuff like that and start.
BULL25|Actually moving to high growth potentially.
BULL26|You know stocks that have higher beta and higher potential to grow through the end of the year.
BULL27|And the other important thing about what we're seeing in markets at the moment, of course, is that very low bond yields have helped finance what we see.
BEAR28|A big pickup in M&A activity.
NEUT29|So if we do see stronger data, I mean what?
NEUT30|How far do yields rise before we start to see?
BEAR31|Perhaps M&A deals start to sort of be affected by high costs of financing?
NEUT32|$1 trillion question right?
NEUT33|Everybody keeps debating at what point does the 10 year Treasury note you get so high that the cycle turns.
NEUT34|So today, for example, we were talking to people at Loomis Sayles, then fast and he mentioned that a 10 year note yield at 4.25%.
NEUT35|And that's it.
NEUT36|I mean, the cycle has turned when we get to that level.
NEUT37|So definitely a much less friendlier market when it comes to M&A.
BULL38|And all these deals we've seen that the bond market has been very friendly.
NEUT39|So a lot of companies said, well.
NEUT40|Maybe I can buy a company you know finance myself to the US bond market and there's so much demand that I can do that easily.
NEUT41|Obviously when rates start getting close to 4%, that may not be the situation.
BEAR42|Well, the 10 year yield is somewhere away from that 4% threshold and will certainly take some very strong data in the coming months to push yields substantially higher from their current levels.
BULL43|"So again, all eyes are focused on Friday's nonfarm payroll report and whether or not we are going to see the spring rebound."""
