NEUT2|Today we will look at the euro versus British pound on the daily chart.
BEAR3|Euro GBP closed below the daily Chipokae cloud for a second day.
BEAR4|After falling below it on Wednesday, technical indicators are giving in an increasingly bearish signal.
BEAR5|The market is below the 200 day moving average and if we look at the RSI, it's below 50 in bearish territory right now.
NEUT6|Tenkan Sen Line, which is the red line, has crossed below the Kijun Sen Line, and this is also very signal.
NEUT7|Prices are now testing a critical Fibonacci retracement level of 61.8 and this comes in at Zero point 7143.
BEAR8|A break below this level would open the way for another leg down towards the 76.4% fib annachi and this would be at zero point 7053 to the upside from current levels.
BULL9|A move past Wednesday's high of 7249 would bring the market.
BULL10|Back to neutral Oubreak above 7492 is required in order to see resumption of the uptrend that started from Zero Point 6935 back in July.
BULL11|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
