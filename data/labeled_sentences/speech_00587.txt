NEUT0|"""Alright, well let's stick together Apple stock."
BEAR1|We can see Apple opening the positive area but closing at the negative area, so it's a very sign short term for this stock.
NEUT2|If we change charge into daily chart we can see here we got a.
BEAR3|Red candle to confirm the short term downtrend after the.
BULL4|Record high of yesterday, but as long as we keep above the year, may I think we still got possibility to go higher from here.
NEUT5|So here is very possible for it to retest supporting or DMA, but as long as we keep above this level is the middle of the distorting.
NEUT6|It means the state fall is still valid, we can see.
NEUT7|Here is the state one is the high high point of this scandal.
NEUT8|The Stage 2 high part of this scandal.
NEUT9|3 high point over here.
NEUT10|And for the four stages.
BULL11|Above this level, so Apple stock goes step up.
NEUT12|And this this.
NEUT13|Intact after the channel.
NEUT14|And we can see from the wound the volume is not too high, so it means there's no distribution at all.
BULL15|"So the pullback here is very constructive, thank you."""
