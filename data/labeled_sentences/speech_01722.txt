BULL0|"""Hey my traders so welcome back."
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video from the stock market Mantra and today I'm giving this particular stock which I had given earlier.
NEUT2|Also for long term holding an for short term.
NEUT3|Also for short term perspective an long term perspective and back again within the first gas limited on weekly charts.
BEAR4|As you have seen that is it is just trading below this 200 DMA, an monthly chart.
NEUT5|Also the similar scenario can be seen.
BULL6|Volumes are rising over here an in weekly charts you if you look closely.
NEUT7|Then if it closes above 510, immediately enter into it for the immediate target of 10%.
NEUT8|That is five 52560 levels and then ultimate target would be 650 and over and over that long term targets are very high, so be with this particular stock.
