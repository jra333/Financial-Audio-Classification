NEUT0|"""Well, let me start with the bull for sale."
NEUT1|Could either bull?
NEUT2|Let's look at this bull here on this bull attacks.
NEUT3|How does it attack it?
NEUT4|Attacks with horns like this.
NEUT5|Up note that bull markets are when the stock market goes up.
NEUT6|Ask yourself how does this animal attack it?
NEUT7|Attacks like that could have a bear please.
NEUT8|Thank you.
NEUT9|How does a bear attack?
NEUT10|Yeah, yeah right, it strikes with its claws.
NEUT11|It sounded a lot like like the bull.
NEUT12|Actually.
NEUT13|If you go back and hear the audio you'll you'll know the shocking similarity of how bears and bulls sound to my ear.
NEUT14|But that's the simple mnemonic that we use here at The Motley Fool.
NEUT15|I think it's a canard.
NEUT16|I don't think there's any meaningful history behind this etymology, but it's a great way to remember.
BEAR17|Bears attack down.
BEAR18|Bull markets go down.
NEUT19|Bulls attack up.
NEUT20|Bull markets go up and over the long term it's been a bull market over the long term.
BEAR21|It's been a bull market.
BULL22|In fact, two years out of every three over the last 100 years, the stock market has gone up.
BEAR23|It has been a bull market most of the time.
BEAR24|With that said, one year in every three the stock market goes down.
NEUT25|Sometimes those years happen next to each other and create a longer bear market.
BEAR26|Some people say we're in a secular bear market.
NEUT27|In the 2000s here at the turn of the Millennium, those are debates for people who wanted to decide what their time frame is.
NEUT28|Do bull markets play out over decades or just years?
BEAR29|Do you want to say that was a bad bear market month?
NEUT30|It's all up to how you want to use the terms.
NEUT31|"My goal here in the video was just to remind you that bears attack down Bulls attack."""
