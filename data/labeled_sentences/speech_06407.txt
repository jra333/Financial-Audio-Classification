BEAR0|"""What is going on guys?"
NEUT1|Thank you for checking it on the watch list.
NEUT2|With that being said, we got a little bit to go over here and see what's going on to this next week.
NEUT3|I got a few key points I really want to point out on what's going on with everything.
NEUT4|So that being said, let's jump right into this watch list.
BEAR5|I've been getting dirty money.
BULL6|Hey guys, thank you for watching this video.
NEUT7|Don't forget to hit that.
NEUT8|Thumbs up and subscribe and always I'm putting out at least one video a week giving you guys absolutely free content.
BULL9|That's going to help you guys.
NEUT10|Whether it's long term short term, just in finance and everything like that.
NEUT11|So that being said, let's jump back to the video.
BULL12|OK guys, we got a few stocks already up in here.
NEUT13|Oh STK CR SPIAU and then drip now drip of course is oil.
NEUT14|AIU is gold and then of course the other two are just companies.
NEUT15|Now when I say this drip is actually going up, it already confirmed for calls or to just buy this actual stock.
NEUT16|I am not currently in this one.
NEUT17|I did not play this one.
BEAR18|I actually missed my entry right here.
NEUT19|So you know if we get another pull back I will actually into this one.
NEUT20|But that's on me and that's also you know, do traveling last week, so that's something else.
NEUT21|I au though, which is gold.
NEUT22|Is actually dropping a lot of you guys know that Warren Buffett actually just bought basically the gold mining company so, but it's a whole totally different thing I think.
BEAR23|I au is going to drop based on the strategy.
BEAR24|We don't see this one drop.
BULL25|We're going to see oil go up.
NEUT26|Oh, SDK is going to continue to continue to downfall here, which doesn't really bother anybody else.
BEAR27|CRST, though I do think we're going to see it go lower.
NEUT28|Everybody told me that you know it.
NEUT29|It's not going to go lower all of a sudden.
BEAR30|You know we are going to see it go lower.
BULL31|Again, both of these are coming off of highs though, so you guys gotta remember that as well.
NEUT32|So when it comes down to I, there's a couple of other ones I really want to look at.
NEUT33|Bank of America is finally an guys.
NEUT34|I've had this one on the watch list for quite a while.
NEUT35|I've not said I bought it.
NEUT36|I said to watch for it here now.
NEUT37|This one is finally just now coming up.
BULL38|It's not quite confirmed, but I do think Bank of America is going to continue to push a juicy in the 27 area here.
NEUT39|Real real soon.
NEUT40|Again, this is just my analysis.
NEUT41|Everybody.
NEUT42|Make sure you do your own due diligence.
NEUT43|Make sure you have your own strategy.
NEUT44|Bank of America is finally getting ready to be in play, which is a big big portion here.
NEUT45|I've just been waiting on this play literally just sitting on it.
NEUT46|You guys go back two weeks in the watch as I was still talking about Bank of America Warren Buffett.
BEAR47|You guys know sold a lot of banks so that may be a big problem for him coming up.
NEUT48|I think he is missing out on money on the other one.
NEUT49|I'm really excited about coming up here is Coca Cola.
NEUT50|I had this wanna watch just a little while ago.
BULL51|I am on this one but I gotta feeling I'm going to buy more.
NEUT52|I did not buy on this dip once so ever in the premarket.
NEUT53|I thought about it.
NEUT54|I didn't do it though.
NEUT55|I'm waiting.
BULL56|I still think Coca Cola has a lot of room to go up.
BULL57|Yes, it did hit a high of $52.14.
NEUT58|I do think we're going to see this one.
BULL59|Keep climbing guys again.
NEUT60|I always like keeping the watch this short, sweet and simple and to the point guys again when it comes down to these.
NEUT61|I'm not just making these based off of trends and stuff like that.
NEUT62|I am literally making them based off my exact strategy.
BULL63|That I teach in the system, so that being said, guys, thank you guys all for watching the videos.
NEUT64|You guys have any questions about any of this, please leave a comment below.
NEUT65|Let me know what company you guys think it maybe I missed a company, down below let me know.
NEUT66|I will always check it out and I will always respond to you guys letting you guys know what I think.
BULL67|"That being said, thank you guys all for watching and I will see you guys in tomorrow's video."""
