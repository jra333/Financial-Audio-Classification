BEAR0|"""But you brought up a bunch of negatives."
BEAR1|I think the biggest negative we have to talk about is these claims.
NEUT2|They are so high that you have to believe that one jaypal knew when he spoke yesterday and two, maybe it lights a fire under those people in Congress who are still jab jabbering.
BEAR3|I mean come on how many people have to be laid off David before they say you know what we better move on this.
NEUT4|I know not to mention those numbers.
NEUT5|I think on people falling into poverty yesterday or what is at least described is that we're talking about millions and millions of people.
NEUT6|We talk about it every morning.
BULL7|The juxtaposition, of course, of the market which is surging yet again, Jim to higher and higher levels than NASDAQ, of course, has been an incredible performer this year.
BEAR8|But the SNP, aiming for another record high you see at the bottom of the screen, you juxtapose that with the suffering that's going on in this country and a lot of people can say, well, I don't.
NEUT9|I don't get it.
BEAR10|I just don't get it.
NEUT11|I had spoke with decoupling this time from Boeing.
NEUT12|And it's really interesting.
NEUT13|This is not just a tale of two cities.
NEUT14|I mean you have people who will have means who are going to get money from the government.
NEUT15|And I've gotten money from the government and they are itching to travel and people are starting to think right now.
NEUT16|David, when we get vaccinated, these people will travel the world, though it's pent up demand.
NEUT17|And then we have other people who for $600 that comes to them.
NEUT18|I mean, they're looking.
NEUT19|They're saying, OK, I soup, maybe Christmas, maybe a Christmas Turkey.
NEUT20|Yes, David, I'm talking about.
NEUT21|Bob Cratchit, so we've got the cratchits and then we got the scrooges disclosures don't mean to be Scrooge, but they don't know what else to be.
NEUT22|I know, and it's hard not to.
NEUT23|Yeah it's right.
NEUT24|That said, Jim, if we do get the 900 billion, let's call it that even though it won't include of course aid to state and local governments, and it does get out fairly soon.
NEUT25|Is that seen as a positive?
NEUT26|Again, for what we end up talking about a great deal for the economy and for the stock market, broadly speaking as well.
NEUT27|I think that it's going to be part one.
NEUT28|I think that when President elect Biden gets in, it will be Part 2.
NEUT29|So I believe that what's happening is people are saying, wait, we're going to get the 900 billion, But that's already in the market, but it's a second order, a second dollop that is targeted in the market.
NEUT30|No?
NEUT31|I've got Brian Moynihan on tonight from Bank of America and he's talking bout targeted stimulus and how great it would be.
NEUT32|This one is not targeted.
BULL33|This is just, I believe, good.
BULL34|The next one could be great for the people who really need it, so if we do get the second one, David, we haven't gone up enough.
BULL35|There's more room and that's how I'm approaching.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
