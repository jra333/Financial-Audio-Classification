NEUT0|"""Hey, it's calling this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well another day, higher highs and higher lows, so the current bounce continues and definitely some updates here need to be done.
NEUT5|So when the newest areas of support now after today and what I would call the ideal level Weakley would make this chart look the absolute strongest moving forward.
NEUT6|And that would be if the price could say up there above.
NEUT7|One 2450 now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 124 fifty.
NEUT8|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage the above that level.
BULL9|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|That is with the Purple line.
NEUT12|There comes into play the 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT14|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes, just gauging the health of the move, that right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT15|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT16|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT17|Head must visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what is being presented against your stand above that level would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance, Public Enemy number one now.
NEUT19|Revealed after today's price wouldn't be right up there around the 1:26 Ish area.
NEUT20|So 126.
NEUT21|Next key battleground to watch moving forward, but All in all then the day what matters the most is what the price is already been doing and that is just buildings higher bases.
NEUT22|So as long as the price keeps on building, our base is.
NEUT23|Or if you wanted those steps.
NEUT24|So in other words you stair steps continue to be constructed in the upward direction.
NEUT25|Then given enough time everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT26|So folks, unhealthy consolidations, folks on chipping away and Bill is higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
