NEUT4|Is in a process of merging with Thunder Bridge acquisition.
NEUT5|We're currently trades under the symbol T HBR, although it will become India under the new symbol I ndy.
NEUT6|Once the deal closes in the next several weeks.
BULL7|Currently they have exposure in autonomous driving connectivity, user face technology, and electrification with the current shortage in the auto industry for some ice chips, this could give chip makers, like indie, some serious business.
NEUT8|Some of the customers include Tesla, Audie Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, GM, Porsche, Jaguar, and Chevrolet.
NEUT9|In addition, the company is projecting to do $500 million in sales by 2025.
BEAR10|If we take a look at a chart very briefly, we can see a clear downtrend from the highs of $15 back all the way down to $10.50 withdraws.
