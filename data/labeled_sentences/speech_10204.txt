NEUT0|"""Welcome traders to freetradingvideos.com."
NEUT1|I wanted to include a trade that doled out a very nice lesson to me.
BEAR2|Market can sometimes be a great teacher if you're open to listening, so this was a big gigantic mistake for me.
NEUT3|The pattern itself is beautiful.
BULL4|Good pull back.
BULL5|Right after a nice uptrend with series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows through here.
BULL6|I told myself that I would get into this trade if it could take out the higher the previous bar.
NEUT7|And put a stop below here.
BULL8|Alright, so everything was intact the next day I did get filled.
NEUT9|Very nicely.
NEUT10|Day after that, a nice person golfing candle right up in the face of this unfilled gap.
BULL11|Alright, so good bit of resistance in here and also up in here.
BULL12|Would have been great resistance on the way up.
NEUT13|The next day it does that, and instead of being stopped out of that trade, I actually did not keep my protective stop.
BEAR14|Alright, so fairly naughty making a big mistake there.
NEUT15|I'm now having unlimited risk just trying to get my money back.
BULL16|Alright, I would do anything for the stock to come back so I could get some money out here if not all of it right.
NEUT17|It's one thing that happens to people when they get upside down in a trade.
NEUT18|Their emotions start running.
NEUT19|Sometimes people will even add to their trade.
BEAR20|They call that averaging down and that could even be worse.
NEUT21|The worst part of all this is that I actually held this trade.
NEUT22|All the way over until the 29th of April.
NEUT23|I'm going to scrunch up the screen to show you that.
NEUT24|How far off that is on the chart?
NEUT25|29th is over here.
NEUT26|On this day right there, so I sat through.
NEUT27|Many, many months.
NEUT28|Of this trade, when I didn't need to, all I had to have done was get stopped out here.
NEUT29|If the stock had done this, I didn't get stopped out and then came back and let me out.
BEAR30|That would still be a very very poor trade because just to get that money back I put myself at unlimited risk.
NEUT31|My account capital should be treated with kid Mittens at all times.
NEUT32|The one thing I did do well was exit the trade.
NEUT33|It doesn't feel good to do that and this stock never ever came back.
NEUT34|I'll show you where it is now, even the stock.
NEUT35|Stayed below this price.
NEUT36|I think it's about $1.90 now.
BEAR37|Yeah, it's still down in here.
NEUT38|Yep, Dollar 90 or so.
BEAR39|This talk is absolutely in trouble for a long time, and if I hadn't exited the trade I would have lost even more time value than I had by not keeping a protective stop.
BULL40|So I hope you can learn from that mistake.
NEUT41|I certainly did.
