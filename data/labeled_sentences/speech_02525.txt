NEUT0|"""Everybody, Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews joining you for another edition of Ask a fool today we're taking a question from FIC or FAC."
NEUT1|I'm not sure which one but Fic asks when researching a stock.
NEUT2|How much weight should I give?
NEUT3|Analysts price targets?
NEUT4|How accurate or successful do these analysts tend to be with these price targets, they burn.
NEUT5|That's a great question.
NEUT6|I think we see this a lot in the press out there.
NEUT7|That's the headlines right every earnings season.
NEUT8|It's analyst estimates and.
NEUT9|Price targets for the stocks.
NEUT10|What you're saying on that.
NEUT11|So the short answer is you shouldn't pay attention to these price targets at all.
NEUT12|First of all, there are typically not very accurate and then also they tend to be very short term in nature and were sort of long term investors looking at three to five years.
NEUT13|These price targets could be for the next quarter or next couple quarters, so I don't really pay any attention to him.
NEUT14|Do you pay attention and not a whole lot?
BULL15|I think you make a great point there.
NEUT16|They do tend to be very short term in nature where we may look at a company and look at it from a 3/5 and 10 year perspective.
NEUT17|And try to get a better take on the valuation of a stock and the potential stock may may have to grow over that over the course of time.
BULL18|That I think is certainly more productive and more informative.
NEUT19|I guess I wanted to get your take real quickly on though.
NEUT20|Just because this is kind of just the way things are, we get these estimates out there.
NEUT21|I mean, a lot of times it seems like that can actually open up some windows of opportunity if those targets or expectations are not met, would you say so?
NEUT22|I would.
NEUT23|I would definitely say that.
NEUT24|So if an analyst puts out a buy or a lower price target on the stock that you think could be a great long term opportunity.
NEUT25|An it does push the stock down, which does happen.
NEUT26|I'd say take that opportunity, pick up some chairs.
NEUT27|Alright, great, well hey, great question.
NEUT28|"Thanks a lot for asking and For more information make sure to check out full com."""
