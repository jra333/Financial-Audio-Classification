NEUT0|"""Hello everyone I'm John with JP strategic investments and today I'm going to go over crowd strikes Q4 earnings report that we just got today."
BULL1|This was a strong earnings report for Crowdstrike and there's a lot to go over, so let's dive right in.
NEUT2|So first, as always, I'll just cover the general numbers and then we get into the details of the report.
BULL3|So crowd Strike added $143 million in annual recurring revenue, bringing their total AR to just over $1 billion.
BULL4|This represents a 75% increase year over year.
NEUT5|They did this by adding a record 14.
BULL6|80 net new subscribers with a non gap subscription margin of 80% which is up from 77% one year ago.
BULL7|All of this allowed them to reach a non gap net income for the fourth quarter of $31.6 million or $0.13 per share compared with a loss of $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year.
BULL8|So these numbers right off the bat are really impressive.
BULL9|Revenue and earnings came in well above estimates.
BULL10|An crowdstrike's own guidance with net income beating the high end of their guidance by over 50%.
BEAR11|This shows that crowd strike is growing.
BULL12|Faster than even they had expected an their increasing their efficiency.
BULL13|This highlights one of the reasons why I'm so bullish on Crowdstrike stock, which is that their subscription model, an efficiency, allows them to add large amounts of recurring revenue without the need for large increases in operating expenses or adding employees.
BULL14|We can see that while there are increased by $143 million from Q3 to Q4, their operating expenses in the same.
BULL15|Only increased by $19 million after accounting for stock based compensation, the increase was actually only about $13 million.
BULL16|This shows that as AR increases further and further crowd Strike's profit margin will get higher and higher.
BULL17|On top of this crowd, strike was able to continue to increase module adoption with subscription customers that have adopted four or more modules, five or more modules and six or more modules increasing by 63 percent, 47% and 24%, respectively.
NEUT18|For any of you that don't know, Crown strikes, customers have the option to choose how many tools or modules they actually pay for.
NEUT19|Obviously, the more modules that a customer uses an pays for, the more profitable that customer is for crowd strike.
BULL20|So it's good to see that crowd strike is able to continue to get these customers to increase the amount of modules they're using.
NEUT21|One of the major benefits of this is that it takes far less effort and expenses to get existing customers to add modules than it does to add new customers.
BULL22|That being said, though, obviously, crowd strike is having no trouble adding new customers with a record 14180 new subscribers signing up with Crowd Strike in this quarter alone.
NEUT23|We also learned on the earnings call that Salesforce, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble were some of the bigger names signing up with crowd Strike this quarter.
NEUT24|And there are a couple of important things to note with these customer acquisitions.
NEUT25|First of all, we also learned on the earnings called the previous cyber security vendor for Salesforce was a quote next Gen vendor.
BULL26|This is really important because it means that not only is crowd strike beating out the legacy vendors like McAfee, there also beating out the newer, more advanced cyber security companies.
NEUT27|Another important thing to note here is that management also attributed some of the major customer acquisitions to Crowd Strike's platform being fully integrated into a WS.
NEUT28|Obviously a WS is the main player in the cloud space, which means that most customers who use cloud.
NEUT29|Shooting in data processing.
NEUT30|Use a WS if Crowdstrike is fully integrated into a WS than a WS.
NEUT31|Customers are far more likely to use Crowdstrike for cyber security than another provider.
BEAR32|As far as next quarter goes, crowd strike does expect a small drop in revenue and earnings due to seasonality in the industry.
BEAR33|Also, there will be some costs related to debt servicing an the Humyo acquisition that will skew next year's guidance over all.
BULL34|These will be short term effects, and I think this was a great earnings report for Crowdstrike.
BULL35|Obviously, most investors agree with the stock up as much as 7%.
NEUT36|After hours and I look forward to a great year for Crowdstrike, an Crowdstrike stock.
BULL37|I hope you found this analysis helpful, and if you did, please consider liking and subscribing.
