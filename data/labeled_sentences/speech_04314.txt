NEUT0|"""Right in today's video, we're going to be talking about Pepsi stock."
NEUT1|You all know what I think about its twin brother, Coca-Cola.
NEUT2|Overpriced, but as Pepsi, any different.
NEUT3|They skip the heck into it.
NEUT4|The company's name is Pipsico and listed the straighter does not just sell Pepsi.
NEUT5|It was originally designed to sell Pepsi.
NEUT6|But then they had excess money and started buying other companies.
NEUT7|They now own massive companies such as Gatorade, Doritos, Mountain Dew, and lays.
NEUT8|So PepsiCo is a beverage.
NEUT9|And food company.
NEUT10|And when I say massive, I mean a massive, they operate in over 200 different countries through six of their business segments.
NEUT11|They have their hand in the pie, so to speak, in the food and beverage industry across the world.
NEUT12|Now I don't really need to get in, so how people he makes its money.
NEUT13|But the food and beverage industry is a pretty basic one.
NEUT14|They manufacture and market their products and then sell them for a higher price than water costs.
NEUT15|Simple, I'll just get straight into the numbers.
NEUT16|So the price is 112.63 dollars.
NEUT17|And they have generated earnings of 3.38 dollars.
NEUT18|They have a PE ratio of 33.33.
NEUT19|So what does this even mean?
NEUT20|Good, bad, average while the average PE ratio for an SMP 500 company is 25.65.
BULL21|So obviously Pepsico's PE is higher than that.
NEUT22|Now we have to question why is Pepsico's PE higher?
NEUT23|Is it because it's a growing company or is it just overpriced?
NEUT24|To do this, we look at the earnings and revenue.
BEAR25|As you can see, the figures are just hovering at best.
BEAR26|Pepsi is a mature company with stagnant growth.
NEUT27|2015's revenue was 63.06 billion and 2017's was 63.53.
NEUT28|If you think about them from a business cycle point of view, they have plateaued and one thing I can say for sure is that they're not a growth company.
NEUT29|Having them priced higher than the average companies price in a market that is already pricey is not at all appealing to me.
NEUT30|I mean, perhaps you could consider Pepsi as an income investment and just use them for the dividends.
BULL31|Possibly a good idea.
NEUT32|But yeah, maybe if you're quite old and want some stable dividends, then it will be a company to consider.
BEAR33|But my overall consensus is it's overpriced and people might be saying a lot of the companies you have analyzed have been overpriced.
NEUT34|And yes, that is correct because we are in a highly priced market when they are in the late stages of the bull run where it is a lot harder to find undervalued investments.
NEUT35|I mean, I still see some of them out there, but I definitely don't think PepsiCo is 1.
NEUT36|Well, I'll leave it at that today.
NEUT37|Are there any other stocks you want me to analyze?
NEUT38|Leave that in the comments.
NEUT39|Also, if just generally you want more videos like these, leave a like on the video.
