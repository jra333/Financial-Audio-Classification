BEAR0|"""This is really the bull market year 2021 Bitcoin, you know has had a 12 year history and it's gone up and down over the last 12 years."
NEUT1|But the markets come into bull market cycles coming every three or four years and 2021 is that special year.
BEAR2|We just had a block reward halving last year so no ones are coming.
BEAR3|But last year pro with Trip Trading barely at $10,000.
BULL4|It's already at over $50,000 and I think with the bull market it could really go up to over $100,000 in the summer.
NEUT5|But wait, it gets better.
NEUT6|It could even 100,000 by this summer.
NEUT7|But you're also saying could triple that, so 300,000 up to by the end of the year.
NEUT8|Is that right?
NEUT9|But yeah, potentially if history plays itself out again, we've seen two of these mega bowls of market cycles over the past eight years.
BULL10|If you recall at the end of 2013 it really went up, you know, 10 * 20 times for that year ending at $1200.
NEUT11|And then again we saw the big cycle for your subsequent, which is end of 2017 and was trading early in the year, just $1000 and then went to $20,000 by year end.
NEUT12|So this year book Bitcoin entered 2021 at.
NEUT13|$30,000 so you know even just a 10X value from that will be $300,000, but I don't know if history repeats itself, But what we do know is that Bitcoin bull market cycles come every four years, and this is a big one.
NEUT14|Bobby, we could also characterize those kind of targets as as a bubble, can't we?
NEUT15|What happened with bubble bursts?
NEUT16|So that's the key thing, right?
BEAR17|So bull market cycles come and go, and after a bull market peak inedibly, it could go down by a quite a bit.
NEUT18|And that's when the bubble bursts in the Bitcoin crypto industry.
NEUT19|We call it Bitcoin Winter and they can last from two to three years.
BEAR20|So after peaks out, whether it's two hundred 100,000 or even 300,000 people should be aware that it could fall as much as 80 to 90% of its value from the all time peak.
NEUT21|So it's it's very volatile.
NEUT22|But as I've written in my book, in my upcoming book, The Promise of Bitcoin, people should not make the mistake that volatility equates to risk.
NEUT23|"Bitcoin is very volatile, but it's the rewards or risk adjusted I think."""
