BULL0|"""Hey everyone, happy Monday to you all."
NEUT1|It's time for our chart of the week and this week we're going to be focusing on retail or Michael Kors.
NEUT2|And let's go ahead and mark this chart up as we go along here and we can see that the stock took a nosedive back in May.
BULL3|An made a bottom here towards the middle of the month and then came in and made a huge surge.
BEAR4|To begin the month of June, it's kind of kind of going sideways over here.
BEAR5|If we forget about this, drop from the Brexit, it's basically kind of gone sideways for the better part of 6 1/2 weeks and we can see on August 1st.
BULL6|Today had a really important day where it broke out on some pretty decent volume as well.
BEAR7|First day of August, but what's interesting is that we've seen from the percent R that this stock has been oversold for pretty much the better part of July.
NEUT8|Except we just had that that one little dip here when Brexit hit.
NEUT9|And it came down to test that 200 day moving average.
BULL10|But by and large I like the action in the stock and the fact that it is broken out here on some pretty decent volume right above the $5152 area seems like it's got some room to get up towards the recent highs from March, which are about $5859.
BEAR11|We could see a downtrend line here that it broke in the early part of July an it's kind of been wandering around the mid low to mid 50s level and now it's ready to make a surge through the resistance level which is roughly around the $55 area we can see.
BEAR12|Resistance from the April highs here so.
BULL13|Michael Kors is a good retailer that we think has some upside potential over here.
BULL14|One of its competitors, coach has also seen some really good flow.
NEUT15|This is the kind of time of year where these retailers are looking forward to what is happening in the holiday period and are getting their inventories ready to go.
NEUT16|I think expectations are probably pretty mild or pretty low for some of these higher end retailers, so perhaps Michael Kors won't need much to get going again.
BULL17|They do have earnings coming out within a couple of weeks and accordingly it looks like they could be.
BULL18|It could be pretty good.
NEUT19|That's Michael Kors.
BULL20|"Thanks very much for watching everyone and I'll see you guys next time."""
