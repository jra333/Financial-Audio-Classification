NEUT0|"""Hi and welcome to another edition of our Daily Market Outlook report."
NEUT1|Today I'll be looking at Apple computers now.
NEUT2|Let's start with the daily chart.
BULL3|Upper computers has been uptrending quite nicely.
BEAR4|It's currently trading below 20.
BEAR5|Moving average with this gap down but above rising 50.
NEUT6|Moving average result.
NEUT7|Blue line here and also 200.
NEUT8|Moving average and we can also see that the price is creating the structure of higher lows and higher highs.
BEAR9|The recent price action appears to be a gap, a lower based on the concerns that continuation.
BEAR10|Of the virus in China might impact on future sales of iPhone.
NEUT11|From the technical point of view, if I change this down to a four hourly time frame, it will become a little bit easier for us to see.
NEUT12|The current price is capped by a.
NEUT13|322 level, which is that gap open and it's also twenty.
NEUT14|Moving average that we mentioned already.
BEAR15|If we see an oversold bounce back from this current lows into that resistance and a breakout above that level.
BEAR16|That could potentially indicate further bullishness.
BULL17|Therefore the continuation of this embedded uptrend potentially targeting additional upside resistance is towards 326 level, which is the cluster of these previous highs.
BULL18|And also this one here breakout above that level could potentially open the way for an extension to the upside and knew all time high towards 300 thirty 331.
NEUT19|A50.
BEAR20|Alternatively, if we see a further consolidation and bearish pullback, lower the loss and end of their close below this area here, which is 315 forty possibly a retest of debt level from underneath could potentially open the way for a deeper corrective move towards this longer term rising trendline and also the cluster of these previous.
NEUT21|Lowe's at 300 and 10306 only.
BEAR22|The loss and end of day close below 306 could potentially target 303, possibly even 300, which would be nice and round Number.
BULL23|And quite quite likely that will be perceived to be a retest of fairly significant rising support level.
NEUT24|Thank you for watching.
NEUT25|Thank you for listening.
NEUT26|Stay safe and happy.
NEUT27|"Trading bye for now."""
