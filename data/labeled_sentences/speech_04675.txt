BULL0|"""Hi folks and welcome to another video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I owe Inbenta lack and today I'm going to talk about Lloyds.
NEUT2|Or rather, I'm going to whisper something.
NEUT3|I'm going to whisper that Lloyds might finally be out of the Woods.
NEUT4|Lloyds has announced quarterly profits on a statutory basis of £2 billion.
BULL5|Yes Lloyds the basket case it's managed to make £2 billion on an underlying basis which is stripping out certain gains and costs.
BULL6|1.5 billion is still a very healthy number.
NEUT7|And as you look through all the facts and figures in today's release and there are a lot, and there's a lot of different ways you could read them, you start to see the picture of what Lloyds is going to be in the future instead of what Lloyd's been in the past.
BULL8|Lloyds is reducing costs.
BULL9|Still it's reduced cost by another 6%.
BEAR10|It's now taking billions out of the business on an annual basis.
BEAR11|Post the H Plus merger impairments this quarter were down 40%.
NEUT12|It didn't have to set aside any more money for PPI protection insurance.
NEUT13|Mean bear in mind that it set aside 6.8.
NEUT14|Billion quid to re compensate customers.
NEUT15|I'm wearing this shirt today, but I remember the good old days as a capitalist when Lloyds could just rip off customers with abandoned.
NEUT16|Now it's had to set aside £6.8 billion, but that is coming to an end.
NEUT17|Imagine where that £6.8 billion could go.
NEUT18|Yes, could go into a dividend not at the moment at the moment.
BULL19|There's no news on the dividend, but I think that's actually an advantage.
NEUT20|If you buy Lloyds currently trading at around its tangible book value, that means most of the business is pretty much in for free and traditionally in non terrifying panic stricken times.
NEUT21|Banks tend to trade for about 1.5 times or even way higher intangible net, so.
NEUT22|That would put Lloyds easily at 75 Pi.
NEUT23|Don't think a pound is out of the question in the next couple of years.
BULL24|Personally I think finally we can see a shape of a business here.
BULL25|It's getting slimmer, getting less dodgy businesses that have to keep hold of yesterday even sold its dodgy Spanish business.
NEUT26|It's cost a lot or less more mortgages.
NEUT27|So there are a few things I'm still worried about.
BEAR28|The loan to deposit ratio is still a little bit high.
BEAR29|Only came down to 119%.
NEUT30|So basically it has to get money from somewhere other than deposits to loan money out.
NEUT31|In ideal world that would.
NEUT32|That's the 100% and I'm sure there will be some other banana skin that it will hit, but I think there's only so many bananas gets skins that this this business can fall over, I think finally we're seeing the new Lloyds.
NEUT33|We're seeing a company that you can buy and get some sense of the future and I think maybe the train is not coming towards us.
BEAR34|"The light at the end of the tunnel possibly that rain is just starting to leave the station."""
