NEUT0|"""Can you show me Apple please?"
BEAR1|I think it just dropped a buckle two.
NEUT2|Yes, it did.
NEUT3|$119 per share right now.
NEUT4|Wait a minute the stocks down and they've got some kind of announcement.
NEUT5|So it looks like they're going to have their annual developers conference that worldwide Developers conference taking place on June the 7th an like last year.
NEUT6|This is still an all virtual events now.
NEUT7|The WW DC is the events where Apple typically unveils and say an iPad, maybe an Apple Watch is something you'll get.
NEUT8|Apple TV and Mac software.
NEUT9|They sometimes launch a cheaper iPhone like they did last year with the iPhone SC not the flagship.
NEUT10|The 12 that we usually get in the fall when we have those launch events.
NEUT11|You don't think this is a big deal.
BEAR12|This announcement is not a big deal is down 2 bucks at 119.
NEUT13|If this was a big deal, that would surely not something I don't see that it's up to bucks OK to bow down to book down, down, down, down, down to right.
NEUT14|So here's a thing without with the Worldwide Developers Conference is that you know Apple is not just a hardware device maker anymore, it has a lot of software.
NEUT15|The App Store.
NEUT16|Which is where they congregate all those developers together.
NEUT17|It's a big deal.
NEUT18|I gotta get to one of those worldwide App Store developing.
NEUT19|I would love to go.
NEUT20|"Maybe maybe it doesn't work for you, but."""
