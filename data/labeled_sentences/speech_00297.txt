NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock price."
BULL1|We can see here today Apple has made a bounce back.
NEUT2|This bounce back has a small lower tail.
NEUT3|That means their buying power needs when it touched the woman to price level.
BEAR4|And also regarding the volume, we can see the volume is small.
NEUT5|That means the volume.
NEUT6|Is not.
BULL7|Enough to support to break out of the upside resistance.
NEUT8|The resistance is just the EMS.
NEUT9|We can see the line is hung above the candle, so it means.
BULL10|Today's jump even is a.
NEUT11|Jump, but this job is only a bounce back.
NEUT12|He's not a reverse.
BEAR13|We are still in a short term downtrend because we got all these candles.
NEUT14|Have the lower law.
BEAR15|The law is lower than here and this one is lower than here so we are in a clearly downtrend and also the next supporting level is will be there.
BEAR16|120 yummies so it's still some room for it to drop, so in my opinion is very very likely for Apple stock.
BEAR17|To drop further from here because we can see here that I'm a city has been crossed for dead cross, here is a dead cross and also the RSI only bounce back a little bit and not enough to change the trend, so be careful.
BULL18|"Thank you."""
