NEUT0|"""Jim, I wanted to get you on the VIX because we're going to."
BEAR1|We're close to breaking below 20, which for a long time and I'm talking since the beginning of the pandemic was seen as some to be a signal, and all clear almost if you could get it with A1 handle, that would say a lot about the year to come, and we're awfully close now.
BULL2|Yeah, 40 plus percent in November.
NEUT3|We don't talk about it enough that new really is amazing.
NEUT4|It is going in the right direction when it comes to what the SNP is doing is kind of confirm atory the SNP.
BULL5|One of the things that I think is incredible, the SNP is is that we've had it just amazing.
NEUT6|My favorite group is the rails, the rails just there.
NEUT7|They are standing the rail stand for Commerce, and they obviously don't have a covid problem.
NEUT8|David, have you seen the rails?
NEUT9|No.
NEUT10|Tell me, well, I haven't you know.
BEAR11|OK well Union Pacific had a really really horrible quarter yesterday and the stock has got oh it's got one of those patterns you like to hit the reverse head and shoulders like that.
BEAR12|Reverse stock went down when they reported the quarter which nobody liked.
NEUT13|It hit 174.
NEUT14|It's now at 206.
NEUT15|David FedEx.
NEUT16|Have you thought about FedEx at all?
BULL17|I have 'cause there was a Barclays upgrade this morning to out to upgrade to overweight when the packet laborat if future between FedEx transportation networks could signal the beginning of a multi year.
NEUT18|Upcycled here yeah 2023.
NEUT19|This stock call it when when the pandemic hit people thought that they were going to be the loser.
NEUT20|I don't know why people felt that way because the way the e-commerce worked it's kind of like air BNB.
NEUT21|I remember when Brian Chesky said well he's worried about whether they be a loser.
NEUT22|Well they were a winner because hotels don't have the kind of cash shave.
NEUT23|Buying somebody else is written somebody elses house.
BULL24|I've watched this FedEx go up soon.
NEUT25|I remember when when they when they hit bottom even they were in desperate, despairing on the conference call was like.
NEUT26|Oh man, yeah we were talking about how long he's been CEO.
NEUT27|And yeah.
NEUT28|Sorry, well, I mean they think about a year ago when the number one topic on our minds was international trade and limits on it because of tariffs and trade wars.
NEUT29|I mean that's when not to mention the difficulties in some of their operating models.
NEUT30|That's what Barclays talks about today.
NEUT31|Jim is that you gotta change the culture before you can get the model change to where margins improve and that's what they see happening.
NEUT32|Although I love that one of the first lines of their note is yes, we can read charts and we know it's daunting to buy at these levels.
NEUT33|There you go, by the way.
NEUT34|My account to Mayo and she used to be the CFO of Home Depot.
NEUT35|She now runs United Parcel.
NEUT36|She told me and I don't know how you could possibly think of it, but she told me they are not going to miss the quarter.
NEUT37|David there knock you meant so very good executive saying they're not going to miss the quarter after UPS missed how many quarters.
NEUT38|Quite a few, quite a few, quite a few.
BEAR39|It was a lot of up and down there.
