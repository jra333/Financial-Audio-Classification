NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol TSL a Tesla."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, quite eventful day here, not only for Tesla, but the entire markets were had a rough day.
NEUT5|That's really the best way to probably put that.
NEUT6|And when you stop and look at Tesla, at least it's not a situation where the markets were having a fantastic day.
NEUT7|And then Tesla here was having some sort of day like this, so I mean it was still a bad day, but it makes a little bit more sense on why.
NEUT8|But Roy, the very interesting dynamic error that stands out to me and that a lot of people are going to be wondering about, is with that last 30 minutes that craziness.
BEAR9|The price is actually broken now down below.
NEUT10|Right here you can see where it closed, but it's broken down below.
NEUT11|These areas were before the prices bounce, so does that mean?
NEUT12|Does that guarantee anything?
NEUT13|No, there's no such thing as a guarantee, but is it a more than valid question?
NEUT14|Is it a more than you know, rational thought to be having?
NEUT15|Hey, is this the start of something that much more bearish to the downside?
NEUT16|It very well could be with the violation of that, and that is why it's definitely smart and wise to be looking at where somebody's next potential area.
NEUT17|I guess I don't need to go back that far.
NEUT18|There we go where somebody's next levels of support a wrap an.
NEUT19|In fact you can see right there that was also a former area of support.
NEUT20|So a lot of history right around that area, which again with the last 30 minutes violated.
NEUT21|You know, like I said, not a guarantee, but could this be the start of a whole lot more downside?
NEUT22|Selling pressure?
NEUT23|It's something that could very well happen and that is why you know I want to map out these next couple areas of support 'cause they could very well be coming into play here.
NEUT24|But if this is the start of something bigger, the downside, then it would not be shocking at all.
NEUT25|Now to see the price revisit down there around the $400 mark if not even probably the 399 ish mark to be more exact.
NEUT26|So that would be the next key area of support.
NEUT27|An if there somehow the price goes down there in that level can't even hold.
NEUT28|Next level after that of support would be down around the three 9250 mark, so definitely keep an eye on these three areas of support.
NEUT29|As far as areas of resistance.
NEUT30|So if the price decides it wants to try to snap back up key level resistance than any sort of movement back to the upside is gonna be that purple line right there with 50.
NEUT31|Moving average which is currently valid, will just call it at $417.00.
NEUT32|But yeah, crazy movement today.
NEUT33|We'll see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT34|Moving forward.
NEUT35|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT36|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT37|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT38|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL40|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT42|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR43|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT44|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT45|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
