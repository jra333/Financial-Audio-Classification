NEUT0|"""Well, it's been the debate of the morning here on CNBC."
NEUT1|If you caught swap, Squawk box, NFT's and taxes, Robert Frank has more on the nasty Surprise crypto holders may be in for Robert.
NEUT2|This is such an interesting topic.
NEUT3|We've been talking a ton of NFTS, but this is something collectors really have to keep in mind.
NEUT4|Yeah, and a lot of them are just learning about it this morning.
BEAR5|The collectors buying NFTS with their cryptocurrency gains could face large tax bills this year for deals.
NEUT6|Most of them thought were actually tax free, and it's all because of an IRS rule around using cryptocurrencies to buy any good or service.
NEUT7|Say you bought $100 worth of ether back in 2018, and it's worth about $1800 today if you use that $1800 in Ether to buy 10 FT, you would actually owe a capital gains tax on the $1700 gain in the ether.
NEUT8|As part of the purchase.
NEUT9|So as soon as you bought that NFT, you would owe a capital gains tax of $340.
BEAR10|If you held that crypto for less than a year, that's a short term gain.
NEUT11|You could always much as $600 in taxes.
NEUT12|Now.
NEUT13|The reason for all this is that the IRS considers crypto a capital asset, not a currency.
NEUT14|And if you exchange crypto for any good or service, you immediately recognize a capital gain or loss.
NEUT15|Experts say most people who were buying an FT today are using their appreciated Bitcoin or ether.
NEUT16|And they are not aware of the tax.
NEUT17|Most platforms that sell NFTS aren't reporting the taxes to the IRS because they don't have the price history for every buyer.
NEUT18|And the tax does not apply to non American overseas buyers.
NEUT19|Which means the buyer of that $69 million people and FT that sold at Christie's last week.
NEUT20|He is a resident of Singapore, so he doesn't owe any tax, but people does pay taxes on the proceeds since he was the artist and the seller, I calculated his state and federal taxes could be as high as.
NEUT21|$20 million depending on what his fees were to the auction partners.
NEUT22|But guys, as John put it so well last week, I think he can still afford to buy a lot more height buttons.
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
