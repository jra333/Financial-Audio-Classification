NEUT0|"""Hi guys, welcome to another episode of the aspiring entrepreneur."
NEUT1|I'm your host.
NEUT2|Humza Chowdhry and welcome to another episode of a One minute recap where we choose the stock and we discussed the price action and our predictions.
NEUT3|And how do a little technical analysis on how the stock performed before I do so I'd like to ask a favor of you if you are new to the channel and you like the video, please hit the like and subscribe button.
BULL4|It really does help.
NEUT5|The channel where 100% free content channels so anything that you could do to help appreciate it.
NEUT6|So with that, let's get started, so I'm going to hit this timer here.
BEAR7|OK, alright, so with that said, you can watch our last video where we actually predicted the Apple Bottom, which was we called it here at 107 fifty, and so we retested that twice as the market was selling off and we had a bunch of negative momentum.
BULL8|As you can see, we're now starting to turn positive in the Mac D. And you can also see that the RSI is pointing up and then you can also see that the 20 day moving average is up and what you can see is that.
NEUT9|Last sort of event.
BULL10|Training day before the major iPhone event we had this massive gap up and today we had hit our one 1260 support which we've had previously in this gap up and we solidified that once again and we traded up and hit this sort of 50 day.
NEUT11|Moving averages are high so I wouldn't be surprised as we enter Thursday, Friday and coming into Monday for the event.
BEAR12|If we retest coming into Tuesday's event, the high of 125 where I do feel like will have some trouble.
NEUT13|So my next prediction will be that will trade between 1:20 and 1:25.
NEUT14|Heading into Tuesday's event.
NEUT15|OK guys.
NEUT16|With that said, good luck and if you enjoyed this video, please hit that like and I'll see you guys next video.
NEUT17|Take care.
BULL18|"Thank you."""
