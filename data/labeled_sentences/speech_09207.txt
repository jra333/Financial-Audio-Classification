BULL0|"""Speaking thanks for watching this quick video on a black Berry stock."
NEUT1|There are a lot of a lot of good news around this company, mainly based on fundamental analysis and there is something I wrote something there, but please just just you can Google it and you can find a lot of interesting news about this company.
NEUT2|And as usual, before investing in any of in any of the stocks in the stock market, please just read a lot of news and try always to combine.
NEUT3|Both technical and fundamental analysis there is in front of us.
BEAR4|This market has been bearish just using a trendline, a basic trend line.
NEUT5|I was able to find this bearish trend behavior since to task 2019 and this is the reason why I've decided to use three hours candle stick just to give you an overview and of these stock and voices was performing know very well since before 2019 invoice in a bearish market end.
NEUT6|We got between April between June, June, June, July.
BULL7|The distant line's been broken once and then again in September, giving US strength signal to this stock.
NEUT8|With this possible runway gap that you know it's a means in my mean start of a new rarely.
NEUT9|So the idea is a good idea.
NEUT10|Is that as we are right now, it seems that the new bullish trend is just started.
NEUT11|And if it is the situation, the idea is to go long to follow this new train.
NEUT12|The first target price is this 12 U.S. dollar only.
NEUT13|If this resistance will be broken, the second target price will be 14.5 U.S. dollar.
NEUT14|Bear in mind that this is for a long term investment because we are three hours candle stick.
NEUT15|It applies also to one hour candle stick.
NEUT16|But the idea is that for long term investment to go long there is another possibility that there will be.
NEUT17|Setback price set back before going long, so that might be my app that other option maybe that.
NEUT18|Or maybe that the this one can work as support approximately almost.
NEUT19|It's almost, let's say 9.5 U.S. dollar.
NEUT20|You can work a support where we can have price retracement.
NEUT21|We can have something like that before before the stock will start going up again.
NEUT22|So walking up now is that this one can just go down up there as we are right now and just start going up so and.
NEUT23|Oh, you can move a little bit around this level.
NEUT24|That is almost, let's say 9.
NEUT25|Let's say I won't say 9.5 or around 10.510.
NEUT26|This is it can work as support before going up again.
NEUT27|So we are already 9.8, so the plan is that perhaps gonna stay little bit screwed up little bit more around this label before going up.
NEUT28|But overall the idea is based mainly on technical and fundamental analysis.
NEUT29|Is to go long so just please read the Lotto news and keep going along as this possible new bullish trend.
NEUT30|"Thanks bye."""
