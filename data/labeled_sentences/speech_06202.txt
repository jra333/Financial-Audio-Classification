NEUT2|All we ask in return please refer friend.
NEUT3|Today we look at the definition of a dividend.
NEUT4|A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, which is decided by the company's board of directors to a class of its shareholders.
NEUT5|Preferred, common, etc.
NEUT6|Dividends can be paid out monthly, quarterly, annually, or in any other way.
NEUT7|The board records sees fit Diffinis may also be paid in cash, stock, or property.
NEUT8|The dividend is most often quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives, referred to as dividend per share.
NEUT9|It can also be quoted in terms of percent of the current market price, referred to as a dividend yield.
NEUT10|Typically, growth companies will not offer dividends because all of their profits are reinvested to help sustain the high growth rate.
NEUT11|For this reason, the larger more established companies with low growth tend to pay higher dividends to try and make up for the lack of growth potential.
BEAR12|A dividends go in and out of favor back before the Great Depression hit, and we had a great big sell off back then.
NEUT13|Investors kind of out of favor with dental care about it, then all of a sudden the Great Depression hit and people started caring about a lot more.
NEUT14|And that's just something to kind of cycles in and out of the market.
NEUT15|In essence, would manage it pays out a dividend shareholders they are in effect telling Cheryl they cannot generate an above average rate of return on the portion of the earnings that they're giving back.
NEUT16|If the company is paying out 100% earnings to shareholders in the form of a dividend, shareholders should recognize the company sees the market as we had saturated, and they do not see any growth prospects for the company.
NEUT17|The near term.
NEUT18|This should cause investors to question why they even own the company stock to begin with.
BEAR19|Really dividends can be suspended by management anytime shareholders own or share her own preferred shares are the first to receive dividends and the last to have their dividends cut.
BEAR20|In most cases, cutting the dividend on a preferred shares creates a debt for the company.
NEUT21|And the company will have to pay back all outstanding dividends to preferred shareholders before paying any dividends to shareholders of common stock.
NEUT22|Now let's look at a couple of different examples of growth companies versus non growth.
NEUT23|OK, here we are now on Yahoo Finance page and look at Center Point Energy ticker symbol C&P.
NEUT24|This is utility in it is not a high growth company.
NEUT25|Typically very stable widow and orphan kind of stock and you can see that it's paying a dividend of four point 3%.
NEUT26|That's pretty substantial and that's like we were talking about earlier, which is just kind of making up for the fact that it's not a big growth company.
NEUT27|Here we have the page on Google Incorporated ticker symbols jyoji.
NEUT28|You can see, yeah, you probably know that Google is in fact a high growth company and their dividend yield is zilch, zero, nada.
NEUT29|They're taking all of their earnings per share and reinvesting back into the company to continue that that monster growth.
BEAR30|Now at some point Google will peak or at least management will think that they have peaked and they will begin at that point to start paying out a dividend.
NEUT31|We've seen that happen with several different companies, but Microsoft is a good example.
NEUT32|Let's look at that record.
NEUT33|For a long time, Microsoft did not pay a dividend as they were pursuing their growth opportunities, but now you can see that they are about painted in 2.6% OK.
