NEUT0|"""Well, well, well, would you look at that?"
BULL1|NATO dimension is trading at 1639 right now and it even touched $17.00, which is this three months all time high.
BULL2|I'm so happy for everyone who was with me and invested with me way before this was even hitting all time high.
BULL3|If you were following this channel we got in at $8.00 per share and now that it has doubled, you've doubled your money.
NEUT4|You could easily cash out if you want or if you want more risk tolerance and you want to gain more money, go ahead and hold a little bit longer.
BULL5|It could be reaching $20 here soon and I do want to go ahead and get into that.
NEUT6|I do want to politely ask you guys to please watch till the end of the video because there are some important news.
NEUT7|As an investor you should know about and to be honest, it's only three minutes long and I'm not going to hold you hostage, but it is recommended that you stay all the way through and if you like channels that get straight to the point and don't waste your time with promotions or two free stocks or four free stocks, no we don't do that here.
NEUT8|We just want to get straight to the point and not waste your time because your time is valuable and so is mine.
NEUT9|OK, let's get into it now.
NEUT10|Nano Dimension is trading at $16.00 a share.
NEUT11|And why is that?
BEAR12|Why is it going up so much?
NEUT13|Well, that's a good question.
BULL14|The reason why Nano dimension is going up so much is because it's been getting a lot of publicity from news outlets an from the general public.
NEUT15|You know how I said Bloomberg made an interview and it broadcasted to everyone in Europe?
NEUT16|Well, that got a lot of retention and now people are starting to flow into the stock info in Nano dimension 3D prints, circuit boards and they do what is called additive printing where they add circuit boards on top of each other and subtractive printing where they remove parts of the circuit board.
NEUT17|You know I try to keep that as.
NEUT18|Easy as possible for everyone to learn.
NEUT19|It's basically like pendall you know it will cancel out no in all seriousness, but I just want to remind everyone do is to put at least 50% of the money into your product development and the other 50% into acquisition.
NEUT20|As I said in my last name or dimension video, they are currently looking for contracts and what their contracts are looking for is for other circuit board manufacturers so that they could either take them over or use their technology set.
BULL21|They could expand.
NEUT22|There's Nano Dimension has an office in Silicon Valley here in the United States.
NEUT23|And if you don't know, Silicon Valley harbors a bunch of companies from tech to automotive to everything in a sector, so they have plenty of potential to pick up another company and take their technology legally, of course, and it's clear that a bunch of people around the world who want to invest have seen this news and people have seen what they want to do, so now they're willing to put their money into nano dimension stock so they can grow and invest in something that's going to expand overtime.
NEUT24|Which is perfectly fine.
NEUT25|And the funniest part about this is.
NEUT26|Every time the stock goes up 15% or 13%, the CEO comes out and says, hey, we're going to do another stock offering.
NEUT27|He knows how to make his money, but that's what the stock market is for.
NEUT28|Every time there is a share offering, the stock usually rebounds the next day or the day afterwards, just in case he does come out with another share offering or stock offering.
BEAR29|Don't be too worried, it's going to drop another 10%, but it'll quickly rebound in my eyes, the days of having a stock at $8.00 to $9 or completely out of here and now, it's time for the stock to start working in testing new highs such as $20 or 18.
NEUT30|Hours, because now that everyone's flooding in everyone wants a piece of the pie.
NEUT31|However, they didn't get in early enough like us who got in at $8.00 per share, so they're not making as much money as we are.
BULL32|Good job.
NEUT33|Do you guys now I do want to thank everyone who made it this far.
NEUT34|I know that this is a really short video.
NEUT35|Tell me in the comments if I should make longer videos because I do want to see your guys opinions.
NEUT36|Other than that, I'll see you guys in the next one.
NEUT37|"Peace out."""
