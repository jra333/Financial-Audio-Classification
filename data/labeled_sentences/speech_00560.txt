NEUT0|"""A price prediction."
NEUT1|We're discovering multi frequency trading patterns.
NEUT2|Investment on stocks has become one of the principle method for financial management.
NEUT3|Investors.
NEUT4|Attempts to discover Latin trading patterns in stock market so they can infer the future trend to make money.
NEUT5|However, as stock prices reflect long term and short term commercial activities, it is still challenging to make a reliable prediction.
NEUT6|Besides predictions in different time range rely on different trading patterns in the stock market.
NEUT7|For example, investors like mutual funds and 401K managers tends to look for long term returns.
NEUT8|Their trading frequency is relatively low.
NEUT9|On the contrary, in the high frequency trading, transactions are processed much more frequently in a short time.
NEUT10|Discovering multi frequency trading patterns should be critical.
NEUT11|However, to our best knowledge, there are no existing methods that decompose trading patterns into various frequency components.
NEUT12|In signal processing, the frequency domain is analyzed based.
NEUT13|This great Fourier transform to capture the long term dependency.
BULL14|The long short term memory emerges as a candidate.
NEUT15|Here we propose our integration of the two methods, the state frequency memory to capture the multi frequency trading patterns.
NEUT16|Here we show the comparison between are in LTM, an SFM SFM is a variant of recurrent in your network.
NEUT17|It returns the gating structure in our stem to capture the long term dependency.
NEUT18|Besides the memory states or decomposed to multiple frequency components in RDF fashion so as to capture the multi frequency trading patterns.
NEUT19|How are you experiments on the real market data being demonstrated?
NEUT20|The more competitive performance by the SFM?
