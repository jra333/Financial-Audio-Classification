BULL0|"""Elephants are going to challenge times watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we are going to discuss about Polarite Itai NCPOLARITYT now don't be confused because if there is any mismatch in the price because there are so many spirits and there are instances where the price is not.
NEUT2|Actually stabilized, but there is no problem with the trend, so we will focus on the trend.
NEUT3|Now, if you're looking at this stock and more specifically the monthly chart, what you can see on your screen, you will specifically see two or three things.
BEAR4|OK, so this is the lower end of the range.
NEUT5|What you have on your screen.
NEUT6|And.
NEUT7|So this is the middle range.
NEUT8|OK, so this is a very crucial level, so that's why we're not going beyond.
NEUT9|I would say and the upper end of the upper line.
NEUT10|This one I will explain it to you and but first let me draw all the important support and resistance line.
NEUT11|So as you can see here.
NEUT12|So as you can see here what we have on the down side are two important support level or you can consider it as your stop loss.
NEUT13|So you have your first support at .83 or $0.83 and the final support or the last stop loss.
NEUT14|Will come at $0.58 now because the stock is holding above .83.
NEUT15|Now it is giving us the confidence that in the upcoming days and weeks there are two levels which are which we're going to focus on.
NEUT16|So the first level will be 2.44 dollars and it can extend up to 4.18 or I would say 4.5.
NEUT17|OK, let me adjust this price a bit so 4.32 now.
NEUT18|For the time being, we are not going beyond 4.3.
NEUT19|Two let me tell you why because.
BULL20|Once the stock successfully sustain above, let's say 4.3 to 4.44 point 5, it will actually open up for a big range.
NEUT21|OK, as you can see, whenever it touches this range, it actually opened up for a big range and that's why we're not going beyond 4.3 to because it will work as a big resistance.
NEUT22|So let's see how the trend will work out.
NEUT23|But for the time being, if it's sustained our .83, we have two targets on the upside 2.44 and 4.32.
NEUT24|And don't forget that don't try to go below.
NEUT25|.58 on the downside, so this is the end of the video.
