NEUT0|"""There's always another sell off, right?"
BEAR1|So on a tepid day where nothing much really happened, Dow sliding 10 points as it be declining.
NEUT2|.11% now said gaining .14%.
NEUT3|Let me tell you how to profit from next.
NEUT4|So you need to remember what got plastered the last time around and then bounced right back.
NEUT5|'cause that's what we're looking for on mad money.
NEUT6|No trust, let's get right to it.
BEAR7|Let's start with you pulling last week, the stock got crushed by people who didn't like the court.
NEUT8|I told you they were wrong, why?
NEUT9|Because those people knew nothing.
NEUT10|Wait for the big game this week and I picked Chipotle is our kicker in our NFL Championship portfolio.
NEUT11|I wanted people to see that this company is capable of taking a 62 yard vehicle.
NEUT12|Well, that was dumb as plywood.
NEUT13|Stupid metaphor.
NEUT14|I should've said that supposedly crunk a player can block and catch and score at will.
BEAR15|The stock had just dropped from 1523 to 1479 off that quarter, even though they had 11% same store sales in January.
NEUT16|This is unbelievable.
NEUT17|I don't care about November, December.
NEUT18|I care about the most recent month.
NEUT19|'cause that's how you're supposed to think.
NEUT20|I was taught that way.
BEAR21|I flagged that action, the stock and I said this is wrong.
BEAR22|OK, this is wrong.
NEUT23|So if you just bought the darn thing, you do very well.
BULL24|Sure, enough today Chipotle hit a new all time high.
NEUT25|Don't sell it right now.
NEUT26|The company is just bang it out with delivery and all sorts of new ways to handle takeout.
BULL27|They're doing these incredible numbers against pre covid comparisons when the stores were packed going for the over the year.
NEUT28|Well and think about it, you every year is going to get much easier.
NEUT29|Why?
BULL30|Because you're able to sit down and get your cilantro lime roasted cauliflower, which is unbelievably good.
NEUT31|I started pounding the table Chipotle roughly 1000 points ago because they finally reached the 18th Mark Month.
NEUT32|Mark.
BULL33|If that less health care and my research shows that the public tends to forget after 18 months, since then you've had a spectacular win.
NEUT34|They barely skipped a beat when the pandemic hit.
NEUT35|How could the market be so wrong?
NEUT36|Give me a break.
BEAR37|The market insanely wrong everyday.
NEUT38|GameStop 3 hundo there are kinds of reasons that stocks get mispriced all the time.
BEAR39|Most common people get scared when they see something go down.
NEUT40|So they figured there's got to be a reason they think it's Russia.
BEAR41|That's true, but sometimes, like in the case of polio, it's a bad reason people are looking at the order numbers, not the new ones.
BULL42|I'm betting it's got more room to run because.
NEUT43|This is telling you.
