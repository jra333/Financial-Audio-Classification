NEUT0|"""Jerry's got Disney."
NEUT1|They have reported what he got for shared.
BULL2|Yeah, it was a beat on most of the metrics here.
BEAR3|It was an adjusted loss, a little bit less than the street expected, but I want to get to the important metrics and that would be in the subscriber.
NEUT4|Everybody's paying attention to Disney Plus now so subscribers came in for the fourth quarter at 73.7 million.
NEUT5|Estimates works for 65.5 million, so pretty big beat right there.
NEUT6|ESPN Plus came in at 10.3 million estimates for 9.19 Hulu subscribers, 36.6 million.
BEAR7|But that didn't make the estimate, which was for a little bit higher at 7737.3 million.
NEUT8|Now going over most of their segments, they had beats on revenue, and most of them, except for parks experiences and consumer products.
BEAR9|Now that was an operating loss.
NEUT10|Excuse me.
BEAR11|That was actually a beat because it was an operating loss of 1.1 billion and it was not as great as the expected loss of 1.4 billion going into networks.
BULL12|Revenue that came in with a nice beat.
BULL13|7.21 billion up, 11% year over year.
BEAR14|And entertainment revenue 1.6 billion down 52% year over year.
BEAR15|But that did not quite make the estimate of 1.83 billion entertainment operating income 419,000,000 down 61%.
BULL16|That did beat estimates by a bit and then cable networks that revenue came in at 4.72 billion, up 11% year over year.
BULL17|And that did beat estimates.
BEAR18|So bottom line, they did have a loss per share of $0.20 on an adjusted basis and the street was.
BEAR19|Expecting quite a bit more a wider loss of about $0.72 per share and that top line revenue number that did beat as welcoming at $14.7 billion.
BULL20|Just looking at the stock now up 6% an on a year to date basis, it is now up excuse me.
BULL21|"That's up over the last three months, but on a year to date basis down about 6% Atom."""
