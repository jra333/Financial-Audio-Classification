NEUT0|"""You stick with with the playbook from key one."
NEUT1|Or do you change?
BULL2|Oh good to see you Melissa I I think you I think you adapt.
NEUT3|I mean you must remain overweight.
NEUT4|Some of the cyclical groups and and consumer discretionary at be our biggest overweight, along with industrials.
NEUT5|But I think you balance that with an overweight to techno or at least to market weight to technology.
NEUT6|We we've been, you know, sort of pounding the table to during the first quarter that this trade is not over the market, in my view is reacting to more robust growth rather than interest rates.
NEUT7|We can have that debate.
NEUT8|It doesn't really matter.
BEAR9|The stocks were down.
NEUT10|And we we see some names that have done nothing for six months like a Microsoft.
BULL11|That will probably be a good bet for the next 12 to 18 months.
BULL12|Yeah, and Nancy brings up a good point Jerry.
BEAR13|In terms of the number of big cap tech stocks that have basically gone sideways for six months.
NEUT14|I mean it is shocking, but the names are the biggest tech stocks in the world effectively.
NEUT15|Do you see some opportunities there, especially as you know, being the reopening trade seems to be so tempting as we ourselves as we get back to our normal lives.
NEUT16|It's tempting to just say you know what the pandemic is over.
NEUT17|Let's switch gears here.
NEUT18|Yeah, I mean we have to acknowledge where we are right with primary thing.
BEAR19|Is professional money managers like us are really torn right now because we've had these great leaders that have pulled back or gone nowhere for them and we're wondering whether it really is time to jump in the water.
NEUT20|And by the cyclicals an I would argue two things.
NEUT21|Number one, those tech names while they're probably going to continue to be sources of funds, they've probably seen the worst of that an it's more going to be a function of.
NEUT22|Who can continue to execute and show?
NEUT23|In Microsoft's case that they got very solid upward momentum, but the other side of this Melissa is to just look at the names that you can find that are have a cyclical play but don't necessarily have to be all in tech or all in thematic momentum.
NEUT24|And we have lots of ideas for that and we want to get to them, but I do want to ask Nancy one more question in terms of being in the cyclical trade and this sort of balance between wanting to be in that trade and recognizing that that is where the growth is, but.
NEUT25|Seeing that there are opportunities, if you take a pair and I'm just going to pick these two stocks, a General Electric in a Netflix Nancy interesting Lee right at this moment in time they're at the same exact forward PE of 54.
NEUT26|So at this juncture, how do you start to look at these sorts of stocks where you have GE with this massive run year to date, and you have Netflix too?
NEUT27|Yeah, I mean that's that's the conundrum.
BULL28|I. I do think that in the case of tge they are in the sweet spot of many of the areas that may benefit from infrastructure.
NEUT29|But for my bet long term I we don't own either.
NEUT30|I so that's my disclaimer.
BULL31|But I would be more inclined to look for opportunities to enter names like Netflix that will continue to Jenn put up growth and that's that's really what I think is going to reward stocks in the next two to three years.
NEUT32|We're participating in this value trade.
NEUT33|But I I think it's a trade.
NEUT34|I think it's more of a cyclical movement than a secular trend, and so we're.
NEUT35|That's why we're barbell in our portfolios because we think that's what you have to do.
BULL36|And it's worked very well in the first quarter of the year.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT38|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
