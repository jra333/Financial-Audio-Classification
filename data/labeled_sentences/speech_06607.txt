NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to this technical analysis video for Tuesday, June the 18th and the pound dollar market."
NEUT1|Here the exam.com zooming now into the daily chart.
BEAR2|We can see that the market has changed direction to the downside, stretching its downward down trend towards a six month low one point 2510.
BEAR3|Earlier today we are assigned to Stochastics have already dropped below oversold levels.
BEAR4|Therefore we see the price trying to recover at the moment.
BEAR5|But within Magdi continue, but with the continued we can be large red signal line.
BEAR6|How we expect negative momentum to return in the short term, in which case we could look for immediate support between 1:25 and one point 2475 where the market post in previous sessions lower than that close below the two year low one point 2393 and more importantly under one point 2330 would add more confidence to this downtrend and therefore bring additional losses.
BULL7|Probably towards the 1.22 psychological level.
NEUT8|On the upside, now we cross above 1.26 and the 20 day moving average currently at one point 2654.
BULL9|Then we might see a stronger resistance coming from the 61.8% Fibonacci of one point, 2770 breaking even higher than 50%.
NEUT10|Fibonacci of one Point 2890 could be a bigger challenge.
BEAR11|Finally, about the medium term outlook Mondays close below the previous low one point 2558 has turned the outlook.
BEAR12|Even bearish if we rebound above one point 2890 we would return to neutrality, but with the 50 day moving average as sloping downwards and below the 200 day, and may such a move may come with a deley.
NEUT13|So that's it for me.
BULL14|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
