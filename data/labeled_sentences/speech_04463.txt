NEUT0|"""Hey Jim, will start with the balance between these covid numbers and the expectation that winter is going to be tough, but gotta say some of the encouraging headlines out of cure vac, at least today."
NEUT1|Saying that this might not be something we need every season 'cause the mutation appears less frequent and more stable at basically refrigerator type temperatures.
NEUT2|Look, I'm convinced that the people involved in this weather before.
NEUT3|I'm sure.
BULL4|I actually think we get good news from everyone from all these companies haven't stopped the trials.
BULL5|I expect good news from a Journal that's going to cause the market despite when it comes out.
BULL6|I expect good news from J&JI.
BULL7|Expect good news from glasses a little behind, but Astra Zeneca each time you get that good news, you have a spike up.
NEUT8|But here's the problem, Carl.
NEUT9|I keep thinking what happens when do we get it?
NEUT10|When do we just go to Walgreens and just get it?
NEUT11|And will everybody get it?
NEUT12|I just think that it's just not, you know, I first thought it was going to be March is April.
BEAR13|I've now lowered my expectations.
NEUT14|David to May.
NEUT15|I think that May is when I I'm pretty confident that I can get it.
NEUT16|Because the distribution you know Washington is playing a curious role, David and distribution dating.
NEUT17|Not playing a role, it's unclear what role they're playing.
NEUT18|Right now you you yes, you are genius.
NEUT19|Thank you.
NEUT20|I'm going to keep that on tape and just play it everyday for myself was not feeling good.
NEUT21|Well doesn't hurt, doesn't make you feel like that.
NEUT22|That's that.
NEUT23|That's not necessarily the way it should be.
NEUT24|No, it shouldn't be.
NEUT25|We want we want a national plan for distribution.
NEUT26|We want to plan your funny.
NEUT27|But listen, I don't know.
NEUT28|I've been hearing different things March, April may it's coming, but it's also, as Karl pointed out, as we've gone through the numbers, it's going to be a very tough couple of months coming.
NEUT29|I mean, the numbers.
NEUT30|Are staggering.
NEUT31|I use the global COVID-19 update.
NEUT32|They have a bit different numbers but you would have 100 and 49,000 yesterday.
NEUT33|Texas had over 12,000 cases.
NEUT34|Illinois had over 12,000 cases.
BEAR35|You know some states are really starting to suffer.
BULL36|Will keep an eye on hospitalizations which are as high as they've been since the peak of the pandemic back in April, and thankfully, as we've pointed out many times, death rate is far lower.
NEUT37|We know how to treat this much better.
NEUT38|That's not necessarily drugs, that's just actual doctors understanding how to treat right then, so that's a great thing, but nobody wants to end up in the hospital, and so it's unclear where we're going to end up here in terms of further restrictions.
NEUT39|Not necessarily lockdowns, but further restrictions on the ability to go out and do things because we do know Jim how this spreads, and typically that is indoors, people not wearing masks well.
NEUT40|What's incredible is we know, no ventilation indoors, viral load.
NEUT41|We all we know, these things, yes, but we're not really, you know, we're a nation of rugged individualism.
NEUT42|That does not necessarily want to be able to say that you can tell me anything.
NEUT43|You can't tell me that I should do contact race.
NEUT44|You can't tell me to get tested.
NEUT45|You can't tell me to wear a mask, and that's you know that's the American way.
NEUT46|And I think the American way is uniquely not so great on pandemics.
NEUT47|Kind of cool when it comes to the rest of the things.
NEUT48|You know, Carl.
NEUT49|When I look at these numbers, what I think of this?
NEUT50|At what point when you have Cuomo saying it's going to be, you gotta close him in 10, what point is at 9?
NEUT51|But point is at 8 I have a company Cisco on tonight.
NEUT52|They claim that the restaurants are still.
NEUT53|OK, but at what point called us to get too cold?
NEUT54|And then the really the absurdity here is is that a lot of these cases are linked to Halloween?
NEUT55|Well, I mean Halloween.
NEUT56|Great national holiday, but what happens when we get the Lincolns holiday of Thanksgiving and the Super spreaders come back?
NEUT57|The kids who don't know it, I mean so we just couldn't.
NEUT58|I mean it's so looming.
BEAR59|That I think we can't even pretend that the numbers are ever going to go down.
NEUT60|I don't see it coming down.
NEUT61|Well, ever ever is a long time Jim, but I know she's saying certainly the Thanksgiving and Christmas, yeah?
NEUT62|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT63|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
