BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So in this video we will go through my second and third Holdings that I have bought into My Portfolio II share that I've bought is Apple and the third is waste management.
NEUT2|Waste management is on the New York Stock Exchange and has the sticker WM.
NEUT3|Apple is under NASDAQ and his ticker AAPL.
NEUT4|So as they already have consumer discretionary product in Coca Cola, I know feel that I am more diversified by having an IT stock and also utility in waste management.
NEUT5|I have added one share of Apple to My Portfolio at a cost of $311.30.
BULL6|Within additional fee of $0.50 adding to $311.80 with waste management.
NEUT7|I bought 3 shares at $98.65 per share and a $0.50 surplus charge adding up to $295.95 plus your additional charge of $0.50.
BULL8|As you can see with the yearly check for Apple, it's continuing to go up even in the current situation.
NEUT9|I'm a waste management.
NEUT10|Is after taking a nosedive so if you know what's a good time to buy the stock and safe and hold Apple pays a 1.06% dividend which is paid quarterly.
NEUT11|And this equates to $3.28.
NEUT12|Yearly waste management pays a 2.27% dividend yearly.
NEUT13|This equates to $2.18 per share, which is paid in quarterly basis when looking through Apple's product and services, you will see household names such as the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, the App Store.
NEUT14|And even things such as Apple Books, I cloud iTunes etc.
NEUT15|When looking through waste management's products and services, one thing that stood out for me is that you're looking to the future terms of recycling and environmental issues.
NEUT16|Just like a lot of the other stocks I have been analyzing, Vanguard, Berkshire Hathaway and BlackRock seemed to be the heavy hitters for laugh.
NEUT17|These companies, and this is no exception with Apple, Vanguard have a 7.22% holding of Apple Berkshire Hathaway, have a 5.6% and BlackRock of 4.28% respectively.
NEUT18|Again, Vanguard and Black Rock make up nearly 14% stake of waste management.
NEUT19|At this stage.
NEUT20|I know of three different stocks.
NEUT21|My Portfolio cooler in the consumer discretionary sector Apple in the IT sector and waste management in the utility sector.
NEUT22|In my next video will be adding in Johnson and Johnson for the healthcare sector and also I will be adding in Bank of America for the financial sector.
BULL23|I feel at that stage I have a well built foundation to My Portfolio which I can build upon.
