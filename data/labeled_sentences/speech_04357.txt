NEUT0|"""Carol on another topic."
NEUT1|It was interesting over the weekend to hear the president at least allude to the Union fight over at Amazon in Alabama.
NEUT2|Here's what he said.
NEUT3|I've made it clear.
NEUT4|Made it clear when I was running that my administration's policy would be to support unions organizate organizing and the right to collectively bargain.
NEUT5|I'm keeping that promise.
NEUT6|So let me be really clear.
NEUT7|It's not up to me to decide whether anyone should join a union, but let me be even more clear.
NEUT8|It's not up to an employer to decide that either the choice to join a union.
NEUT9|Is up to the workers.
NEUT10|Carol, what do you make of it?
NEUT11|.
NEUT12|That's what he supports.
NEUT13|You know this is what he ran on, and so this is what he's talking about.
NEUT14|I think Amazon is going to run in every you know.
NEUT15|Tech company has a different buzz saw and I think employee issues or the one Amazon's or is going to have to deal with.
BEAR16|They've hired so many people during this pandemic I think they're up to 1.2 million.
BEAR17|I'm sorry if I have the wrong number, but it's they've hired quite a lot of people in the last year and so they're going to end.
NEUT18|They have warehouse workers, they have drivers, they have all kinds of different workers, and so I think the president supporting it is a good thing.
NEUT19|I'm I'm also supportive of unions so.
NEUT20|Not everybody is, and I understand Amazon's arguments that they're trying to, you know, they've got this business is going forward.
NEUT21|They went to the $15 minimum wage that they do for their workers, but at the same time, it's up to the workers to decide if they want to form unions.
NEUT22|And you know, it's Scott Galloway and I talk a lot about this.
NEUT23|How?
NEUT24|What is a worker now?
NEUT25|What happened within the UK with Uber and different things like that?
NEUT26|So I think the idea of what a worker deserves and it may not be an employee.
NEUT27|It may not be something else, but there's got to be a new way to form unions.
NEUT28|A new way to designate employees so that everybody gets healthcare and all kinds of other benefits, and I think that's probably what President Biden was talking about.
NEUT29|Kara, we've been talking about this a bit on the program.
NEUT30|I feel like the superpower and the purpose behind the Union has got to shift in this era that we're in right now because the structure of the economy and the workplace has changed so much, it's no longer about a picket line in front of a factory, right when you've got.
NEUT31|A cloud driven, mobile driven economy when people are working from home.
NEUT32|Can you pick it your own house?
NEUT33|How exactly is that going to work?
NEUT34|And you know, sometimes you see these companies.
NEUT35|You mentioned Amazon's $15 kind of minimums ahead of where the government is on a lot of these things too.
NEUT36|So even if these workers are able to unionize, even if the president is backing them, do the unions know what to do?
NEUT37|I don't know.
NEUT38|I think it's an interesting question.
NEUT39|I should really have someone from the unions and sort of more innovative.
NEUT40|I've interviewed lots of union organizers around the Uber and things like that, but it really is is a watershed time for unions to figure out what should be the next moves and how we should organize in this way.
BULL41|And I think the government is going to have a lot to do with it and President Biden throwing his support there is going to make a difference.
BEAR42|I suspect you know we can't operate the way its operating and unions certainly have lost a lot of cloud over the past.
NEUT43|Few decades and with this group of companies certainly so, and one of the problems I think we've talked about is the different levels of people at the companies, the people who work in Google's kitchens are not the same as their engineers and they have different goals, and so it's not really this even a similar workforce during in some of these workforce.
NEUT44|And Lastly, all these contractors that they're using, I think, is really problematic, and they've got to figure out a way to organize an be able to demand different things they want from these companies it's I think.
NEUT45|Workers are the ones that should decide how they should organize, and they have to think hard about how to do so.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
