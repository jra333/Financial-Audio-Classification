NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and as you can see the 3000 level continues to be important as we broke above there."
BULL1|We actually rallied to 3030 and.
BEAR2|As a result, found a lot of selling pressure.
BEAR3|Now we're well below meter.
BULL4|Frank were 2985 pretty quick sell off once New York got online.
NEUT5|This area here all the way to 3100 is worth paying attention to.
BEAR6|I think this is going to be difficult to break.
BULL7|I fully anticipate a pullback.
NEUT8|Plus you have to keep in mind that some people were buying down here 2400 ISH, maybe 2500.
BULL9|They're more than willing to sell this to five 600 points above where we started.
BULL10|That's an excellent gain.
BEAR11|So volumes have been pretty thin.
NEUT12|Something worth paying attention to as well, and most of the gains have been overnight in the Globex.
BEAR13|That's not good sign.
NEUT14|That's not where the big money typically trades.
BULL15|"So I do think that we're probably going to at least pull back a bit."""
