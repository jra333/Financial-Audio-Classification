NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the gold market."
BULL1|You can see that we have rallied a bit to tense the top of this this descending trendline here, which is part of a symmetrical triangle.
NEUT2|At this point, if we can break above the highs of the day, I think 1750s calling 1800 as well.
BULL3|We have broken above a couple of inverted Hammers from the previous couple of sessions right at 1700, so this is a very good looking chart.
NEUT4|It is trying to get there.
NEUT5|All it needs is a little bit of a push.
NEUT6|I think.
BULL7|The 50 day MA also offers support as well.
BEAR8|Lot of fear out there being spun by politicians in the last 24 hours trying to keep control of the populace.
BULL9|"Therefore that fear translates into higher gold prices."""
