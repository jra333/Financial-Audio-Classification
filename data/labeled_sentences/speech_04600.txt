NEUT0|"""Hello."
NEUT1|I've been making investing videos on various options strategies and today I would like to share with you a trade called by Dave Santorelli.
NEUT2|If you follow his Facebook Group Day, trading stock and options room.
BULL3|You know that he is an incredible options trader who has had some amazing results.
NEUT4|Just as some proof, here's some of his trades from the past week.
NEUT5|He's been bullish and buying calls on Facebook since $81.00 a share.
NEUT6|Now just under 95.
BULL7|He predicted Netflix rising on the seven to one stock split and through earnings.
NEUT8|Both of which he was right about.
BULL9|He bought Google Options going into earnings and we see it up 16% today near $700.00 a share.
NEUT10|He puts minimal amounts down and has had frequent profits over 100% and even over 1000%.
NEUT11|So I'd like to share some of his trades with you.
NEUT12|Today the trade I'm going to show you is a call on Amazon.
BULL13|He made a bullish option call when the stock was at 4:55 and doubled his investment in one day.
NEUT14|But today we'll look at a call that you can execute going into next week's July 23rd earnings.
NEUT15|By buying a July 31st call expiring.
NEUT16|When he announced the $500 call option idea, I bought 2 contracts and the premium was $12.93.
NEUT17|Which was a total cost of $2593.49 with commissions.
NEUT18|Now there have been a couple people in the Facebook group asking questions about options Basics and you have to understand that we have no intention about ever exercising this option.
BULL19|We just hope to sell it on or before July 31st, hopefully for a higher price.
BULL20|So using my options Calculator you can see the stock has to rise 6.52% in the next two weeks to get to the break even and rise 8.89% to be a double.
NEUT21|Considering the massive beats and price gains with recent tech earnings, this is not unreasonable at all.
BULL22|In fact, the last trade on this option was 1375, so the option itself is already up over 6%.
BEAR23|This is the pure speculative bullish call that could drop to worthless if earnings are disappointment.
NEUT24|So never risk anything you are not willing to lose on a speculative play like this.
NEUT25|But if you want a lot of leverage to play events like earnings without needing to put a massive amount of money down, this is how you do it.
NEUT26|If this trade is a bit too expensive or risky for you, then you can also use a vertical call spread strategy to lower your cost break even and potential loss.
NEUT27|I have a separate video on that that you can check out, as well as several other options strategies with more to come.
