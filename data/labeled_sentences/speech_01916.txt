BULL2|A symmetrical triangle pattern on the four hour chart has paved the way for ongoing gains.
NEUT3|The chart pattern is created by a couple of trend lines that link a series of price peaks and troughs.
NEUT4|Generally, the trend lines cross at a roughly equal slope.
NEUT5|The pattern brings to light a period of consolidation ahead of either a breakout or a breakdown.
NEUT6|Note that a breakdown occurs when price slices through the ascending trendline which identifies the beginning of a downtrend.
