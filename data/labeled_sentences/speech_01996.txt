NEUT1|Holiday is the world's biggest shopping day.
NEUT2|Global markets are fixated on how much mainlanders will spend that day, but it's not just about how much they spend, it's how they do it that's attracting attention, not to mention investment these days.
NEUT3|Mainland is can use their mobile phones to buy almost anything.
NEUT4|There a bit like British royalty, they hardly have to carry any cash.
NEUT5|Even St carts selling traditional Chinese breakfast.
NEUT6|One of the oldest cuisines on Earth take payment by iPhone and investment capital has poured into mobile apps like Olama.
NEUT7|Which means are you hungry that deliver cut price meals like breakfast right to hungry office workers?

NEUT9|Yard open again.
NEUT10|Yeah, OK yeah yeah.

NEUT15|Those short on time for lunch can use a mobile app to order fresh, tasty local Chinese fare from vending machines right in their office buildings.

NEUT18|Shooting at a glance, but rather their apps that even promise a professional medical consultation for about $1.50.
NEUT19|And having had breakfast and lunch via app dinner at a Chinese noodle joint is only a mobile phone swipe away.
NEUT20|Quit your Super Sonico question.
NEUT21|Jeans are falling and found *** ** **** you.
NEUT22|So if I'm hungry, I can use my smartphone to order a cheap meal delivered right to my desk, or maybe a manicure or some movie tickets, or an egg Mcmuffin, but pretty soon I should also be able to use my smartphone to shop here.
NEUT23|A traditional Chinese wet market, giant squid, anyone, or maybe a leg of pig with hoof still attached as long as China.
NEUT24|Has money to shop.
NEUT25|Chinese Internet companies will find cool new ways to take it away from them.
