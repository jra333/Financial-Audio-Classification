NEUT0|"""What are predators would have invested?"
BULL1|We got plug power jumping in after hours trading and really trading at pretty high today due to a 1.5 but Bubba billion dollar stake from a South Korean joint venture company called SK Group.
NEUT2|So let's go ahead and jump into the charger cord.
NEUT3|Plug Power is within the EV market.
NEUT4|Of course that has been super super hot of last year of 2020 and I think potentially could continue to run into 2021 in the future.
BULL5|We had some initial resistance at 36 but now as you see.
BULL6|In after hours trading in premarket were up 42.
NEUT7|We actually hit 45.
NEUT8|Let's go ahead and peruse our way over to like an hourly chart here.
BEAR9|As you can see here, that after our trading is really took it off, hit a high of basically 4495 almost 45.
NEUT10|We do have some potential resistance at that level, but we'll see how trading goes in today.
NEUT11|And yes, be safe, take it easy, catch you guys.
NEUT12|"On the flip side, Bruce."""
