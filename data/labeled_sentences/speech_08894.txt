NEUT0|"""Look just to give you the quick and dirty update on AMC."
BEAR1|I know a lot of people are panicking right now as I talked about it yesterday.
BEAR2|It was down to $10 and it went down to a low of $9.76.
NEUT3|I think this is a buying opportunity.
NEUT4|I don't think of this as a negative thing in and by any means there are hedge funds that are clearly manipulating this to bring this stock price down.
BEAR5|While people do hold a lot of the shares so don't think that this is going to continue to go down.
BEAR6|It's going to drop all the way down to 1 penny.
NEUT7|Like they say it's going to.
BEAR8|If it does drop down to $7.00.
NEUT9|The buying opportunity $6 buying opportunity, but it will not go lower than that.
NEUT10|It's not something that's going to continue to push down in my opinion.
NEUT11|I'm currently holding 1750 shares at a cost basis of $9.50, so I'm OK with it an I'm going with it and if it does drop more, I'm buying more by the dip.
NEUT12|That's basically the rule and what I'm going to live by in this case so.
NEUT13|"Yeah."""
