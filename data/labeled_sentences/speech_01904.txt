NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol CL DX."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|So if you go there I'll explain in detail.
BULL3|Very nice movement on this one today.
NEUT4|Not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume an well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one going into next week.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal lovers they claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and then we have the price.
NEUT8|Can stay up there above $2.80.
BEAR9|Now again if that level fails, that doesn't mean the entire charge destroyed or anything like that, but yet the price could hold above there.
BULL10|That would certainly be a massive sign of power going forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and looking at all of this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT12|The 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT14|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT15|That right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch out purple line.
NEUT17|As long as the price stays above that line, Aslan itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT18|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|Everyone visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT21|Yeah, stand above the green line.
NEUT22|There would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT23|As long as the price is above that purple line, the bull is 100% owned.
NEUT24|The chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|Mine mine, it's all about that resistance trendline going there which is representing the selling pressure that did show up.
NEUT26|So overall though, keep an eye on that, but if the price can get a good solid high volume break, I mean no such thing as a as a guarantee.
NEUT27|But Price couldn't.
NEUT28|Like I said, if the price can get the high volume break of there then it wouldn't be shocking to see the price.
NEUT29|Revisit the 3:30 and probably get up into three 4350 range.
NEUT30|But like I said First things first, gotta get a high volume break of that red line on.
NEUT31|Although anyway, look at it.
BULL32|Great way to end the week.
NEUT33|Great volume, so let's see what happens with this one going forward.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird.
NEUT39|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT40|But in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT46|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT47|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
