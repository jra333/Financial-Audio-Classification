NEUT1|Good to see you tell us what the trade is.
BULL2|Thanks for having me.
NEUT3|You know I'm invested in silver.
BULL4|I think there's a lot more upside here.
NEUT5|We're going to get you stimulus from the US in silver doesn't care as long as it's coming, whether it's whether its fiscal or monetary, with interest rates at zero.
BULL6|So we're also seeing stimulus from the Bank of England today.
BULL7|We're also seeing eurozone growth cut, and that's going to be more stimulus from them, so I think that's all very supportive to the metals.
NEUT8|And then, on top of that dollar, weaker is big too in what we're seeing not only just U.S. dollar weakness, but Chinese you want strengthen the Chinese one.
NEUT9|It's about 7% against the US dollar, and there's another 3% ago that's from June.

BEAR14|Well, we're running into the 50 day moving average little pullback.

NEUT18|You're risking the $5 which is $5000.
NEUT19|Your target to the upside is 3475.
