NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the British pound U.S. dollar."
NEUT1|You can see we're right here at support at 1:30.
NEUT2|Trying to form a little bit of a bullish candle stick, a hammer or something to that effect.
BULL3|So if we can break above the top of that, we will more than likely go towards the highs here on Friday.
NEUT4|If we can break above there then we can really get going.
NEUT5|Otherwise, if we break down then you need to look to this area here right around 1:29 and a half, and then maybe even 128.
BEAR6|This is a difficult market to throw all your money in retail sales on Friday were horrible, so that of course isn't helping the situation either.
NEUT7|"But at this point, we're still we're still watching and waiting, but we have some very clear areas to pay attention to."""
