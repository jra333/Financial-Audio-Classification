NEUT0|"""Check out the daily chart of the S&P 500 E Mini Futures right last week."
BEAR1|Yes and Pete broke down pulling back to the 3000 level.
BULL2|Alright is the breakdown will turn out to be significant floor of support.
BULL3|That floor held in the index came roaring back because the floor hell garners betting the Bulls were being controlled going forward.
NEUT4|What's that mean symbol?
NEUT5|So CSP can stay above the 3000 line.
BULL6|She thinks that that opens the door for retest of the all time highs near 3400.
NEUT7|The texting resistance is around 3250.
BULL8|If we can clear that hurdle garners thinks it's smooth sailing to that high.
NEUT9|When you look at the relative Strength Index, which is down here, the RSI it tells a different hotels are very similar story that can make this thing work.
NEUT10|It's this is the RSI itself is an important momentum indicator.
BULL11|It's pointed higher and crucially, it's still in the middle of the range, meaning the markets not yet overbought.
BULL12|That's important, this corner we can still there's still more room to run.
NEUT13|It was up here then we'd be a lot more worried.
NEUT14|What if you zoom out to the monthly chart of the S&P 500 E Mini futures?
NEUT15|OK, you can see that the the actions created a kind of expanding wedge.
NEUT16|That's a very very bullish pattern.
NEUT17|Now, before the pandemic hit, we had irrational exuberance that took us to new highs.
BEAR18|Then Covid came along and the SNP crashed because we were in the grips of an irrational well, let's just say.
BULL19|Fear that was justifiable, but when it came to the stock market, maybe not now, though the first one the market spent months snapping back and Garner thinks this momentum could carry us back and do irrational exuberance territory.
NEUT20|If we head back to the high end of the wage, she's betting ESP could make new highs around 3500 which aligns with what we saw on the daily chart plus the RSI again midrange alright?
BULL21|Meaning we aren't overbought on the monthly chart either.
