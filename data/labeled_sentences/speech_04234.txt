NEUT0|"""Excluding a weekly Top 50 welcome back is the 6th of April 2021."
NEUT1|Two status, second day of the week we write the number 32 iota whitiker, My Utah, Utah Forio targets BC I don't know if this is an inverse head and shoulders or not.
NEUT2|Yes no.
NEUT3|Yes, look at this.
NEUT4|Looks good, right?
NEUT5|We're hoping that Iota doesn't.
BEAR6|Fall back under the skin being working out just continues consolidating over here.
NEUT7|Before breaking higher right?
NEUT8|That is the hope that we have for Iota if he's gonna do that.
NEUT9|Great, but we're not exactly exactly sure whether that's going to be the case or not, so we have to be very, very careful about going into a trade too soon for Iota.
NEUT10|How we will love it.
BULL11|You know we could get some confirmation of sorts before putting on a trade, because we just barely broke out of the skinny pink line, so it's going to take a lot of effort to stay above it, so we hope that I ordered a stay above it, and after that continues on a bullish trend against BTC.
NEUT12|If that happens, great, we have a target over here at 3500 Satoshis.
NEUT13|Are we going to go there?
NEUT14|We are not exactly sure, so we're going to be rushing into a trade until we see a proper.
BULL15|Bullish reversal chart pattern right.
NEUT16|So we are aware of the potentials but we're not exactly sure because to pop back down because to come down for an accumulation for a symmetrical before breaking higher.
NEUT17|Absolutely possible and so you're not going to be rushing anything until we have proper confirmation.
NEUT18|Alright, let's move on to our games USD, but before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT19|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think.
NEUT20|Biotin documents below for IO targets USD.
BULL21|Yeah, this is also very nice in person shoulders left shoulder.
NEUT22|Ate rice or a palm we blasted off.
NEUT23|We've hit first targets.
NEUT24|We have another target over here at $2.10 worth $1.70.
NEUT25|So are we going to eat it?
NEUT26|Probably.
NEUT27|How much how are we going to?
BULL28|Potentially we could go up towards $3 in about $0.20 like that somewhere above $3.
NEUT29|However, we're going to take things one step at a time.
BEAR30|Right now you can see very, very, very, very, very, very clearly that there is a double bearish divergance right higher price, lower high on the lower high on the RSI.
BEAR31|You could see significant weakness over here.
BEAR32|Absolute significant weakness.
NEUT33|So this means that potentially things could be reversing back down for IOTA soon, I think, but of course.
NEUT34|Stranger things happen as well so but but there's really a double bearish divergance and things could be reversing, so you need to be very careful about going into a trade too soon for Iota.
BEAR35|Right now things are pretty overbought and there is really a double bearish divergance so.
NEUT36|You don't buy things when there is a double bearish divergance, so be very careful about going to a trade too soon for Iota.
NEUT37|Alright, I guess see from my attorney code analysis.
BULL38|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL39|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT40|"I should see you in the next video."""
