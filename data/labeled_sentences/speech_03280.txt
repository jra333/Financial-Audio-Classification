BULL0|"""Hello everybody, welcome back for another video."
BULL1|Hope you all doing well and that you're all having a great day just a little quick video found something else online.
NEUT2|Always like finding these things a couple days ago we had a video where this guy right here wrote an article about it.
NEUT3|Says is Ripple a scam?
NEUT4|He's also written many other articles about other crypto currencies but.
NEUT5|This one I think Forbes got a lot of Flack for a lot of people weren't too excited that they listed something like this on their website.
NEUT6|So Interestingly enough, Forbes is actually published another article where they actually go over the misconceptions about Ripple and XRP and exactly how they pertain to the cryptocurrency world.
NEUT7|Here's the actual article right here.
BEAR8|Says 14 common misunderstandings about Ripple and XRP.
NEUT9|I won't go through all of them more like a snippet of what this person is talking about.
NEUT10|It says XRP is not needed, they go over.
NEUT11|Exactly what that means in the cryptocurrency.
NEUT12|SpaceX RP is too volatile banks who won't hold it stable coins are a better fit for cross border payments.
NEUT13|There is no need for SRP when central banks issue digital currencies.
NEUT14|SRP is not a real crypto currency, etc.
NEUT15|If you can see for those who are looking at the screen, I've scrolled about 1/5 of the way down and there's still a lot more to go.
NEUT16|I will actually put this article in the description below for everyone to read it.
NEUT17|This person actually goes over exactly why.
NEUT18|Or rather, he is dispelling a number of rumors and misconceptions and misunderstandings, as it were about Ripple and the currency XRP and how they are used and how they are needed in the cryptocurrency space.
NEUT19|If you are or someone you know, which is fairly often for a lot of people, have misunderstandings about SRP or people think that they know exactly what XRP is and they are trying to figure out exactly what it is because I still see a lot of people writing in the comments section.
NEUT20|Sometimes that the Ripple team can continuously print.
NEUT21|SRP or that SRP is actually not deflationary.
NEUT22|I've heard it all.
NEUT23|This person actually goes over all of it in the actual thing that he has here.
NEUT24|So I will list this for everyone to have a bit of light reading as it were.
NEUT25|Like I always say, make sure to do your own research, because when you do your own research you can tell other people what you know and it spreads information so that there are less people who don't know what's going on in the cryptocurrency space.
NEUT26|Alright, like I said, little quick video.
NEUT27|Just thought I'd put that out there.
BULL28|Hope you all are enjoying your day.
NEUT29|Hope you all have a great day morning, afternoon and or evening, wherever you are, wherever you might be.
BULL30|Hope it's absolutely fantastic.
BULL31|Thank you once again for watching and listening.
NEUT32|And yeah.
NEUT33|I'll talk to you soon.
NEUT34|"Sue"""
