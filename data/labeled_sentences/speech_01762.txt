BEAR0|"""I think the economy is definitely slowing use or certainly nondefense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft telling you that moving forward business spending is going to slow down."
NEUT1|And of course the third quarter number was nothing to get excited about, less than 1%, eight tenths of 1%.
BEAR2|So business investment is slowing down.
NEUT3|Now people will say, oh, you're seeing housing and you're seeing autos weakening, but that doesn't shock me because that's exactly what you would expect after eight fed tightening's not only the most interest sensitive sectors, but the sectors that get most impacted by whatever the Federal Reserve does so.
NEUT4|That doesn't shock me.
NEUT5|What is starting to disappoint me is business investment 'cause we need that to get better productivity so we can get better potential growth if we don't get that then we are getting prepared for a potential recession in 2020.
NEUT6|Michael buybacks surpassed CapEx so far this year.
NEUT7|Is that healthy?
NEUT8|Yeah, I think so, and I would probably agree with Anthony's comments that you know we do appear to be slowing at some point, But the question is, is that a blip in the road?
NEUT9|Is that due to certain uncertainties that are out there?
NEUT10|You know, trade the midterms, etc?
NEUT11|And is it just a temporary situation before another leg of growth?
NEUT12|And I do agree that the volatility that we're seeing in the last month and in general the entire year has been due to investors trying to re calibrate exactly where we are on this spectrum of of how long gated the growth cycle is going to be, whether we're topping.
NEUT13|Where we're going to open all of those questions?
NEUT14|Michael, just to give you a sense about ugly October's been.
NEUT15|There's three trading days left during the month.
NEUT16|The SNP is only closed higher five times.
BEAR17|What is this done to psychology and sentiment around the current stock market and just how brutal it's been during October?
NEUT18|Well, it's always hard to predict when you're in it, but but the we tend to see this as a bull market correction more than the beginning of a bear market.
NEUT19|You know when you look at the yield curve when you look at corporate earnings, you look at low unemployment, etc.
BEAR20|These are all bullish signs and I don't think they're indicative of recession at the moment.
BEAR21|On the other hand, you know the trade issues that some of the outlooks, the revenue outlooks from a couple of bellwether text last week, and those those were less than positive.
NEUT22|You got the midterms were depending on what happens, not necessarily in the short term, I think.
NEUT23|You can game plan you know whether the House goes Democrat Republican, the Senate, likely Republican.
NEUT24|It will set the tone of the debate going forward.
BEAR25|And if investors start to feel like there's a change afoot, going into 2020, that can impact business spending that can impact confidence that can begin to curtail the recovery or the the optimism of continued recovery that you should get from the tax cuts and the cap ex spending.
NEUT26|And the liberalized depreciation rules.
NEUT27|So there are real risks out there and then, geopolitically.
NEUT28|Look what happened in Germany today.
NEUT29|You still have Brexit out there.
NEUT30|You have Saudi Arabia, you have China.
NEUT31|These are all risk factors.
BEAR32|That could be a death by 1000 cuts to a growth story in the longer term.
NEUT33|And so our concern would be not necessarily today, but where we're going a year or two down the road.
NEUT34|"And I think a lot of investors are probably in that same camp."""
