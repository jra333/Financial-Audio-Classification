NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to base that this is uncommon."
NEUT1|Sharma well today I'll talk about web of Global limited stock.
NEUT2|Somebody asked me this question what do I think about this stock?
BULL3|Well, I would say it's a good stock.
BULL4|It's a mid sized company and it's a Midcap stock and mid caps are likely to do well this year.
BULL5|This talk is also doing well.
BEAR6|It had fallen a little bit, but on January 29th it had climbed back to 2600.
NEUT7|Mark.
BEAR8|This talk has given up peas issue of 37.75%.
BULL9|Which is not bad and this talk you know how was around this 2600 level mark, but it has the potential to climb up to 2800 level.
NEUT10|Mark it as done in the past.
BULL11|So for the last five years this talk has given good returns.
NEUT12|As I said 37.75%.
NEUT13|Now this company is owned by Sunil Agarwal and it has been ranked by Fortune 500 list of midsized company at around 2:30 four level.
NEUT14|And this company has subsidiaries in.
NEUT15|Chop and see the jewellery channel, XTS Jewels and many more like this.
NEUT16|It deals in the company, deals in electronics and jewelry and lifestyle accessories.
NEUT17|The company is a wholesale and also isn't retail business.
NEUT18|So you know direct B2B and B2C companies.
NEUT19|So this is a little brief about the company the company was launched in 1980, so it's been around for 40 years and it has.
BULL20|It has been able to maintain its level.
NEUT21|That's why the fortune ranking.
NEUT22|So now if you bought this talk below 2600 and if you want to sell it and book profit, you can do that.
NEUT23|And if you bought it above this then of course you should hold it for some time and also.
NEUT24|This is a Midcap stock which you should actually have if you don't have it.
BULL25|You know, because it is likely to do well.
NEUT26|It also has its arm in electronics and electronics are likely to do well, so you can actually buy this talk if you don't have it.
NEUT27|Of course the price is around 2600.
NEUT28|You can actually wait if the stock falls down a little bit so it has fallen down.
NEUT29|Do you know around you, know, 2500 something like that not below that or sometime, but if it goes down more when you can buy it around 2400 or $2300.
NEUT30|So for that you have to wait so you can hold this talk.
NEUT31|If you are having this talk, hold it.
NEUT32|If you are looking to book profit and your target price or you're buying price has been achieved then you can send it.
BULL33|So it's a good midsize talk, and MSME stocks are likely to do well.
BULL34|The government is likely to encourage MSME.
BULL35|It has increased in the stimulus package.
NEUT36|Is it announced in last year?
