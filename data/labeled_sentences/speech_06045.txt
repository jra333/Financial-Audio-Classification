BEAR0|"""Some breaking news."
BULL1|We have earnings out from Snowflake.
NEUT2|Jerrod Blicker has those numbers for sure.
NEUT3|Yeah, that's right.
BEAR4|The stock is down 6 to 7% in after hours, and that's because of a miss on the bottom line, but it was a beat on the top line, so let's start with that number.
NEUT5|Fourth quarter revenue for Snowflake coming in at $190.5 million.
BEAR6|Estimate was for lower at 178 point 5,000,000, but that loss per share that came in at $0.70 per share.
BEAR7|The street was expecting a much narrower loss of $0.17, so that's probably accounting for some of the weakness here.
NEUT8|Now they are seeing product revenue for 2022 of 1 billion to 1.2 billion.
NEUT9|Estimate was for one point 1 billion.
NEUT10|So basically basically in line right there, and they're also looking for.
NEUT11|Let me see that was the product revenue.
BEAR12|There are also seeing a loss per share of trying to get this number right here.
BEAR13|Sorry, I have a slight technical problem with my readout here, but not getting that number.
NEUT14|Basically a miss on the bottom line and let's take a look at what this stock has done since inception.
NEUT15|Now here's the Max chart and you can see well off of some of the IPO price here.
NEUT16|About $180.00 for sure, but this could be interpreted as a giant head and shoulders formation which just broke that neckline very recently, maybe today if we do sustain some more losses tomorrow, probably going to confirm that pattern here.
BEAR17|But to summarize, it was a beat on the top line revenue, but a substantial miscella big, much bigger loss than anticipated for Snowflake here guys.
NEUT18|Jerrod, thank you and thank you to Charles Lieberman, the CIO at Advisors Capital Management, Jason, where buddy I didn't even get a chance to grill you on anything.
BULL19|I think your family might say it's time for a haircut in the back there, but you're looking good again the next time.
NEUT20|Come back soon.
NEUT21|Jason Ware with Albion Financial Group the CIO.
BULL22|"Thank you both."""
