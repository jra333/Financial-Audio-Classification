BULL0|"""This is only the fourth time since World War Two out of 12 total bull markets to reach it."
BULL1|This far, we've advanced by more than 210%, which is much higher than the other bull markets on average.
NEUT2|Where the average gain is about 165%.
BULL3|This current run, I think is quite unique considering what we've gone through over the last over the last six to 10 years.
BULL4|This this economic term that we had downtown that we had in 2008, 2009 I think, really gave investors an companies a real new perspective on how to move forward in their businesses.
BEAR5|Unless we are worried about events in the US or outside of the US, that could cause investors to start worrying about recession again.
BEAR6|Without that, the market could continue to creep its way higher.
BULL7|I think there's a very good chance that we do reach the 7th birthday of this bull market.
BEAR8|That said, we have gone 41 months without a decline of 10% or more and the average since World War Two is 18 months.
NEUT9|I think companies changed the way that they looked at things.
BULL10|They they were able to cut costs and still be able to provide the same product they were able to give their their clientele the experience that they still needed.
BULL11|With less people investing back into their companies has been a very new thing that has helped these companies and giving money back to their shareholders.
NEUT12|I've hired over 1000 people over the last two years and recently 300 over the last two months.
NEUT13|There is nothing more American than job creation and job creation for us for our city, our city.
BEAR14|"The Motor City has had the most job loss of any major city in America."""
