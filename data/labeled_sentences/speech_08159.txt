NEUT0|"""Let's talk about Amazon at you just mentioned Jeff Bezos profit and sales there both handily beating estimates, but the current quarter guidance is why don't know if you saw this is just so wide and because of that, I think giving investors a little bit of pause saying they expect you know, $4 billion of costs tide to covid as well."
BEAR1|So while it may be a holiday season, there's going to be costs embedded in there for Amazon to fulfill them.
NEUT2|Yep, so while Awos so, let's start with that.
BULL3|Sales were up 29% to $11.6 billion.
BEAR4|Obviously that's an excellent performance, but the profit margin was a little bit weaker than was anticipated, so I think post earnings.
NEUT5|The focus is on the moderation in the profit margin.
NEUT6|And then, as you cited, the $4 billion covered related expense.
NEUT7|What I would suggest for Amazon.
NEUT8|Is it similar to the experience of the 60% of S&P 500 companies that have?
BEAR9|Already reported it's a classic example of good news and bad price action.
NEUT10|And what I mean by that was there's not very much here within the Amazon report where an investor would say I need to liquidate my Holdings of Amazon.
NEUT11|In fact, these are very strong numbers that are being reported, but what you are really doing is you're resetting the expectations as you move forward in the coming quarters, and I think that's what it's about.
BULL12|I think it's a pause that ultimately will refresh for Amazon.
BULL13|And the cloud business, both for Amazon and for Alphabet, was incredibly strong.
NEUT14|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT15|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
