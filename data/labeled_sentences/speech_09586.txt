NEUT0|"""We are going to take a look at what's going on in the markets right now as we see this rally, I'll be at a pretty modest one right now are Jerrod Blicker."
NEUT1|He is with us here with an update.
NEUT2|So what's going on in the market today, Jerrod?
BULL3|Well, a modest rally it is, but will take those gains.
NEUT4|It looks like the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ and the Russell 2000.
BEAR5|Each up around 1/3 of 1% a little bit less than that.
BEAR6|So the outperformance by both tech and the small caps continues.
BULL7|Both of those going up in line together.
NEUT8|Taking a look at the at the NASDAQ 100 heat map, here we see Teslas stand out.
BEAR9|That's down about 3% Amazon Apple, both slightly in the red, but Facebook alphabet and Microsoft solidly in the green here.
NEUT10|But I want to get to our heavily shorted board because some interesting things going on.
NEUT11|GameStop has been in the green for most of the day.
NEUT12|Looks like it's expressed.
BULL13|Let's get back to GameStop up 5% now.
BULL14|Been up as much as 15% but you can see one on this five day chart that the volatility has really tamped down and maybe 45 is a level here of support.
BULL15|We have to see going forward, but the standout in this group which we were talking about before in a different context is sundial growers that cannabis play up 44% today.
BULL16|Up 97% over the last five days and now off to crypto land where we have Bitcoin and ether taking a little bit of a breather after coming off of those record highs.
NEUT17|But guess what?
BEAR18|SRP is up 6% and we also have doge coin in focus here that is still down about 1% and this is despite Elon Musk tweeting about it and we have that tweet coming up here.
NEUT19|Bought some ditch coin.
NEUT20|Excuse me, put some Doge coin for little X so he can be a toddler Hodler.
NEUT21|And yeah, more Dodge coin news, so there you go guys.
BULL22|"Such as it is alright, thanks so much Jerry."""
