NEUT0|"""So how does she feel about the current setup?"
NEUT1|Alright, take a look at this daily chart of the S&P 500.
NEUT2|Broken thinks this is a binary picture.
BULL3|If the big index can break out a bit higher from these levels.
NEUT4|She puts a monster rally, but if it can't Mount Breakout, then she's little less sanguine.
NEUT5|First though, let's jump back to late March because it's a great illustration of how our methodology works.
NEUT6|Alright, so.
NEUT7|Remember, broadens called the Fibonacci Queen for reasons she measures passed swings then runs them through the prism of Fibonacci ratios that are potential, price, target, and timing targets.
NEUT8|When she finds a cluster of these important financial levels, it's often a sign that a stock or index is ready to change direction, so it's a predictor when the SP bottomed in March, you had a cluster of Fibonacci price relationships running from 2165, two 2194, and we only bottomed in 2191.
NEUT9|Meanwhile, based on the duration of past wings, there were a bunch of phenoxy timing cycles running from March 22nd, March 26.
BEAR10|We bottom on March 23rd.
NEUT11|This is all the stuff that was available in her work since then.
BULL12|This charges turned much more positive.
BEAR13|We've gotten a series of higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT14|Gotta break out over the five day exponential moving average.
NEUT15|Five day is the blue OK, right?
NEUT16|There's a breakout above it on the 30 minute chart where every tick represents half an hour of trading.
NEUT17|Broadens gotten her favorite by Trigger.
NEUT18|The Ultra short term 5.
BULL19|Exponential moving average crossed above the 13.
NEUT20|Moving average in there we go.
NEUT21|That's what she really wants to see, I know.
NEUT22|Little technical, there's just one fly in the ointment.
BULL23|Yes, would be still awesome, broken out above its 200 day simple moving average.
NEUT24|Which is calling around 3000.
NEUT25|That's what makes this chart so binary broaden is concerned that the 200 day moving average could act as a ceiling of resistance.
NEUT26|And it might be a hurdle that can't be taken out, and it has to be.
NEUT27|Don't get me wrong, CSP is by right here.
NEUT28|There's too much going right in or charge for her to say anything else.
NEUT29|However, she says you should be ready to sell if we fail to break out over the 200 day moving average.
BULL30|Eventually once we get above that level, the Bruins got some incredibly bullish longer term price targets, 3720 maybe 436.
NEUT31|Oh, that be huge, but the SP can't clear that hurdle.
BEAR32|If instead it breaks down below, the might May 14th low at 2766.
NEUT33|Well, guess what?
