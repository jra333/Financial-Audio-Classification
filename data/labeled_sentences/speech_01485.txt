NEUT0|"""Bring some news on the banks."
BULL1|Berkshire Hathaway clearly paring back his Holdings in a lot of the bank stocks that he owns.
NEUT2|Clearly redeploying some of that capital tored the Pharmaceuticals as we told you about earlier in the hour, but let's start with what he's doing with the banks.
NEUT3|JP Morgan.
BEAR4|That's take almost pared back entirely 96% decrease in the holding of JPM down to about $93 million, which for Berkshire Hathaway is a very small holding.
BULL5|Also paring back a stake in PNC by 64% that.
NEUT6|Holding was about $211 million at the end of the third quarter.
NEUT7|Some interesting moves as well with Wells Fargo, Anbia Bay each which had updated filings in August, since those filings since August 14th.
BEAR8|The stake in Wells Fargo has been pared back by about 6.6% in B of A since its interim filing in August, that steak was pared back by about 2% empty, also paring back a stake in that company, down 36% to $270 million, notably.
NEUT9|No change in US Bancorp, which is a sizable stake for the firm, and as we mentioned earlier, a lot of that capital appears to be redeployed to Pharmaceuticals, taking stakes worth about $2 billion at the end of the quarter in AbbVie, Merck and Bristol Myers, Squibb's some sizable positions in the pharmaceutical space now.
NEUT10|Also worth noting that that is, as of the end of the third quarter as of the end of September 30th, and those positions may have changed since then.
NEUT11|Sarah, I'm just going to jump in, let's see, I mean interesting.
NEUT12|On those banks positions, a lot of them we kind of would expect to continue.
BEAR13|Including JP Morgan, which was already selling down that the two standouts for Mia Wells Fargo only down a further 6.6% in holding versus August 14th, because he's been steadily selling that all year was left with about 3% of the company having previously been about 9% of the company.
NEUT14|The fact he had not exited by now given the pace of selling over the prior couple of quarters, perhaps a little bit of surprise, though.
BEAR15|Wells Fargo stock has been particularly depressed over the last.
NEUT16|A couple of months, or maybe he's a little bit price sensitive around the $24.00 mark or something like that and therefore didn't sell more over this past couple of months and Bank of America down only a fraction.
BEAR17|But from all of the prior couple of quarters it seemed like he was slimming his Holdings across most of his banks portfolio and topping up slightly.
NEUT18|His Bank of America, but a reversal in direction even though it's a small set of sales even though he got regulatory clearance to go higher in Bank of America stands out to me a little bit though.
NEUT19|Not a massive massive sale of stock there relative to his buying it earlier in the year.
BULL20|Yeah, and it's worth noting with Wells Fargo.
BEAR21|He has been paring back its stake significantly just since that that mid August filing.
BEAR22|It's showing a much lower decrease in the stake as of the second quarter he Berkshire Hathaway actually pared back at stake in Wells Fargo by about 46%, so it is significant quarter over quarter.
NEUT23|It's just since that interim filing.
NEUT24|We want to provide the most up-to-date information on the selling based on that August filing.
NEUT25|And same is true with Bank of America.
NEUT26|Although interesting, latest stake in Bank of America.
BULL27|Has increased since the second quarter, up by about 9.2%, so it's kind of all relative to those mid interim filings wealth.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
