BULL0|"""One of the key sticking points then for OPEC and its partners as they look to these talks and try and get some kind of agreement."
BEAR1|Hi, obviously this news on the you know crucial meeting being delayed highlights of some deep discord within the group.
BEAR2|We've seen some cracks emerging around group members such as UAE in Iraq in the run up to this meeting, which is now delayed Thursday and one of the biggest challenges they're facing at the moment is probably the price of crude oil itself.
NEUT3|Look at if you look at, you know, Brent crude price.
BULL4|This is the global benchmark ended November almost 30% higher thanks to all these expectations that COVID-19 vaccine will help bring fuel demand back to pre pandemic levels.
NEUT5|And Brenda started another November.
NEUT6|Actually at a level of $37 a barrel.
NEUT7|And it's now trading near $48.00.
BEAR8|This elevated level of prices could weaken any sense of urgency to reach consensus to delay the planned output hike as higher prices risk encouraged with some members to want to ramp up production, especially those on the more severe fiscal strains.
NEUT9|Because even after this steep price gains the current.
BEAR10|Oil prices remained well below fiscal break.
NEUT11|"Even oil prices for many of the open producers."""
