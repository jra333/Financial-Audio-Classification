NEUT0|"""What's up investing fam?"
BULL1|Today we just got some news from genius that I think is pretty exciting.
NEUT2|Let's talk about Shaq's garage and Toy Story coming up.
NEUT3|Welcome to the channel.
NEUT4|This channel is all about personal finance and investment.
NEUT5|Now.
NEUT6|In this video we're going to talk about a news release the Genius Brands released today.
NEUT7|We're then going to take a look at 4 catalysts that I think you're going to drive the stock higher, where then going to move to the chart to take a look at see if we can identify some new support.
NEUT8|Then I'm going to tell you what I did with my shares today in Genius Brands.
NEUT9|So let's just get right to the story.
NEUT10|So in the news release today, Genius.
BULL11|Announced that they have identified some folks for the production team of Shaq's garage, and it looks pretty good.
NEUT12|We've got a guy from Toy Story on it.
NEUT13|You've seen Toy Story.
BULL14|Toy Story is pretty good, so we've got the Academy Award nominated writer Joel Cohen from Toy Story.
NEUT15|Dude, I think that's a really.
NEUT16|I think it's.
BULL17|I think it looks great, man.
BULL18|I think it looks fantastic.
NEUT19|The other thing I like what they said in this announcement is to me it looks like the time beard is bumped up.
NEUT20|Probably found the guy to do it right so originally I had it slated for spring of 2020 next year 2022.
NEUT21|So, but now it's bumped up to fall 2021, so that's cool, so I think that's going to be one of the catalysts.
NEUT22|Are they gonna move?
BULL23|So let's go over the four catalysts that I see that might move this stock higher number one.
NEUT24|We've got Marvel this month.
NEUT25|If there's a deal with Genius and Marvel, they're waiting to announcement dying to hear what it is.
NEUT26|I hope it's not terrible.
NEUT27|So as long as it's good, I'm good with it, right?
NEUT28|So we've got to deal with Marvel coming out then after that.
NEUT29|April, we've got superhero kindergarten with Arnold Schwarzenegger coming out.
BULL30|Remember that's made the stock popped twice now, so now it's actually coming out after a year of waiting.
NEUT31|Then in June, we've got the Roblox series coming out.
NEUT32|Now the fall #4, we've got Shaq's garage coming out fall 2021, and I suspect that the Marvel thing is going to come out next spring, and maybe that's why they help bump the Shaq's garage up a little bit.
NEUT33|So now let's quickly look at the chart.
BULL34|So I think I've identified a little bit of support.
NEUT35|I might be redelivered into this, but check this out so when I draw support, I usually look for at least three touch points when I make it a support line.
NEUT36|So here if I do this diagonal going up, of course I've got 123.
BULL37|Alternatively, if I go across or horizontally 123, so I think we've got some reasonable support now, may not be the strongest support in the world, but we've got some support.
NEUT38|So what's all this mean for me?
BULL39|I can tell you that I picked up more shares today.
NEUT40|I was going to wait until it dropped under 2 bucks, but I just went ahead and pulled the trigger and bought some more shares.
NEUT41|So that's why I want to let you know today.
NEUT42|And hey, if you have not seen my other video about genius, I'll put it right here and a genius is too aggressive for you.
NEUT43|I got another.
NEUT44|"I got another video for you about my reopening play and I'll put it right here and I will see you in the next video."""
