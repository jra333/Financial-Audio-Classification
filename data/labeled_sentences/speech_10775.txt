BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
BEAR2|Hope you guys are having a fantastic day and before we get started this one quickly mention once again they have linked to my discord in description where I have over 935 members.
NEUT3|We have a great community in there, so feel free to join and check that out if you haven't already.
NEUT4|Both of them at let's get right into this video.
NEUT5|So today's video and then going over company known as Lords Town Motors.
NEUT6|Their ticker symbol is right.
BULL7|And as you guys can see, we're having a great day today.
BULL8|There are $5.36 or 24.66% up to a total of $27.43.
NEUT9|Take a quick look at the weekly chart you can see in just the past week.
NEUT10|Now they're going to be 37.37%, or about $7.50.
BULL11|In the past month, up 41% past three months only 7% and then on the year 173.80% you can see they reached previous all time highs back on September 21st of 2020 when they hit $31.40.
BEAR12|Ever since then they've had these pretty volatile dips in these big spikes in these pull backs and spikes, and they do look pretty strong.
NEUT13|Falling stays news.
NEUT14|You can see that they did announce that they had their pre-orders for their pickup truck.
NEUT15|Past 100,000.
BULL16|Obviously that's a pretty big number and this is great news for Lordstown Motors investors.
BEAR17|You can see that this number also doubles their number reported in mid November of 50,000.
NEUT18|On the other hand though, guys it's important to remember these pre orders from commercial fleets or non binding or often just a letter of intent, but nonetheless is still some pretty good news.
BEAR19|If we take a look at them here on thinkorswim on the daily chart you can see they are breaking all of my support and resistance lines where they were pretty flat.
NEUT20|They traded between this middle and this upper view up.
NEUT21|You can see in the second half of the day volume kind of poured in.
BULL22|It was pretty consistent.
BULL23|Throughout the whole day today and they broke this resistance level maintained pretty strong above.
NEUT24|It can just roll this nine Ma, which is this blue line all the way up.
NEUT25|You can see they tried to break this up a resistance at $26.92 at a clean rejection off of it.
NEUT26|Tested again, broke it, held it and now they are well above it.
BEAR27|At $27.42 people who break them down here on 180 day chart to see the bigger picture you can see they do have some pretty clear support and resistance lines.
BULL28|Like I said they are touching this upper resistance.
NEUT29|If they do break this and maintain above it you can see the next.
BULL30|Major resistance looks to be right about here at $28.82, and that's definitely a level to watch out for.
NEUT31|If you are trading options or things like that.
NEUT32|If I go ahead and pull up the moving averages, you can see they do look pretty strong.
NEUT33|They had this nice bounce off of this 50 MA, which is this white line right here.
NEUT34|You can see they touched it.
NEUT35|Shot all way up by these two massive green candles are size now overbought Mac do you can see is pretty high as well, particularly early you can see pretty much the same thing.
BULL36|Pretty clean bounce off all those emmas volume has poured in and this was a pretty clean move like I said.
BULL37|On the year there are sites still sitting at 66, so I still do think they have some upside.
NEUT38|I do think that this news could carry them into tomorrow.
BEAR39|Guys can also see that they do have earnings about a month away on February 15th of 2021.
NEUT40|If we go ahead and take a look at this option chain you can see they have pretty affordable options.
NEUT41|You can see the weeklies expiring this end of this week at January 15th of 2021.
NEUT42|The 27.5 called that the money is going to cost you $180.00 up front as a D528 of 22, so not the best ratio also has really low open interest in volume, so I'd stay away from this one.
NEUT43|You can also see that the Ivy is sitting pretty high, 161.59% if you are bullish on them.
NEUT44|I would wait for a bit of a pullback like I always say guys, you never really want to buy in after 24% move unless it's just a short term swing or things like that.
NEUT45|Something I'd recommend doing is really farther out.
NEUT46|Maybe April 16th of 2021 you can see that the money strike the $30 call is going to cost you right now $543 has a Delta 55, a state of three, much more volume and open interest in the Ivy still is pretty high.
NEUT47|So like I said I would wait for a bit of a pullback before entering in.
NEUT48|Are any call options or things like that out in Lordstown Motors?
BULL49|But this could be a good play if they do pull back and this could definitely be printing in the long term.
NEUT50|Other than that guys that is about it for this video.
