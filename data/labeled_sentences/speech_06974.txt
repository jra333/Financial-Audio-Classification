NEUT0|"""They're always."
NEUT1|They're always thrilled to be competing, aren't they?
NEUT2|I mean, they tend to signal that in previous quarters.
NEUT3|I think what they're trying to sort of sort of talk about really is yes, all these new entrants are coming into the into the into the marketplace.
NEUT4|We had Peacock launching.
NEUT5|We had Disney plus earlier this year.
NEUT6|Viacom CBS is revamping their service to be more streaming forward.
NEUT7|There is a key difference there right?
BEAR8|Unlike these others, Netflix spends every penny on production and then some right there are going to be cash flow negative next year.
NEUT9|So despite this sort of a nice.
BULL10|Cash flow positive.
BEAR11|We had this quarter last quarter at most of this year that's going to go back down next year.
NEUT12|That's ultimately a positive if you're an investor, right?
NEUT13|Because they are pumping all their money and Disney for all the money that it spends on on sports rights.
NEUT14|An content movie, studio stuff, a lot of it doesn't end up on streaming right away, and it may never end up on their streaming service, so that's still sort of a bridge.
NEUT15|They haven't crossed as well as other competitors, so once that starts happening, however, that's when Netflix really should start getting worried, because for all the money, they're spending, these other guys actually are spending more on content overall.
NEUT16|Kevin, I want to ask your perspective.
NEUT17|As a shareholder, the 2.2 million net additions for subscribers.
BEAR18|Does that fall in line with what you were expecting as far as a moderating growth rate from what we saw during the height of the pandemic last quarter?
NEUT19|You where are you disappointed?
NEUT20|Well, you know I. I think it's within the it's within the boundary.
BEAR21|I mean looking back at the last year, certain stocks you know pallet on zoom kind of came out of nowhere and got this huge updraft.
NEUT22|But you just have to remember that Netflix was already kind of a monstrous success before all this happened, so the fact that people stayed home?
BULL23|Yeah, it helped them.
NEUT24|But you know, this is already a story was rolling and it's kind of a law of large numbers.
NEUT25|Netflix is big already.
NEUT26|They can't, no matter how many things go their way they.
BEAR27|They can't accelerate beyond a certain level, but he is the content slate strong enough going into the new year, and of course it comes as they lose some of their legacy shows as well, like the office.
NEUT28|Yeah, so in the in the in the shareholder letter they mentioned again that the content slate should be more second half wait in fiscal 21.
NEUT29|Deal for you.
NEUT30|As you mentioned parks and REC in the office coming off the service too.
NEUT31|And you know, we think it's really interesting as Kevin just mentioned, Palatine here.
NEUT32|I mean Netflix is Evie's sales.
BEAR33|Multiple had gone from 6 times to about 8 1/2 times in.
BULL34|Revenue estimates only moved up a percent.
BULL35|Contrast that with someone like Peloton where revenue estimates and moved up by 20%.
NEUT36|So really, it's where these stocks are in the growth curve and you know we prefer a stock like peloton?
BEAR37|They're still just really in using the Netflix playbook to disrupt the fitness industry.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
