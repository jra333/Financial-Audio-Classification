NEUT0|"""What about the the two big oil companies?"
NEUT1|Exxon and Chevron today.
BEAR2|Both of them drags on the Dow right now of you.
NEUT3|I know that Mike won't want to hear this, but I'm done with fossil fuels.
NEUT4|We're done.
NEUT5|Yeah, they're just because we're starting to see investment all over the world.
NEUT6|We're starting to see the companies just regard them as I've been big big pension funds.
NEUT7|Saying listen, we're not going anymore if you think that's the biggest thing holding these these guys back and not necessarily just oil production from here in the United States.
NEUT8|Absolutely, I think it is.
NEUT9|You could say listen.
NEUT10|China obviously swing work smart, know the world, change, you know there's new managers they don't want to hear whether these are good or bad.
NEUT11|Look at BP.
BULL12|It's a solid yield.
BULL13|Very good.
NEUT14|Look at them back.
NEUT15|$5 billion with the stock.
NEUT16|Nobody cares and this has to do with new kinds of money managers, who frankly just want to appease younger people who believe that you can't ever make a fossil fuel company sustainable.
NEUT17|That's why I said Mike was trying everything in camp, but in the end they make fossil fuels and that's going to be we're in the deathknell phase.
NEUT18|I know that's right now phase for the stocks, but not for Dell phase for us using fossil fuels, right?
NEUT19|Well, I think that the issue is sustainability.
NEUT20|Look, this is the other side of Tesla.
NEUT21|These stocks don't want to be owned by younger people.
BULL22|Their dividends are great there.
BULL23|These companies are doing better than obviously when oil was it.
NEUT24|Even four years ago, and where was the 2627?
NEUT25|But you can tell that the world's turned on them and it's actually kind of happening very quickly.
NEUT26|You're seeing divestiture by a lot of different funds.
NEUT27|It's going to be a parade.
NEUT28|It's gonna be afraid.
NEUT29|This is look.
NEUT30|These are tobacco, and we're not going to him.
BEAR31|That is a really tough stream to swim against their tobacco.
NEUT32|That's the case.
NEUT33|I think they're tobacco.
BEAR34|We're in a new world and some of us can be dragged kicking and screaming to even believe that that could be the case.
NEUT35|"But yeah, they're tobacco."""
