NEUT0|"""But let's squeeze in a mad Dash service now."
NEUT1|Yeah, David, now this is Bill Mcdermott's Company and this is a company that does some of the absolute best Internet service management.
NEUT2|Why do I mention it?
NEUT3|OK, I mentioned earlier dated dog and I know because of that name.
NEUT4|People think that small cap.
NEUT5|It's a $28 billion company service now is at $93 billion company and they are very highly valued.
NEUT6|Barclays bumps his price target from 6:40 to 6:50 and just saying look.
BULL7|Even though there is a rebalancing toward value away from growth, service now should be able to Buck that.
NEUT8|Now what that says to me, David, this is the line in the sand.
BULL9|If you see service now be able to stabilize, you can imagine that all the cloud stocks will stabilize.
NEUT10|So that is something to watch.
BEAR11|The cloud stocks have been under tremendous pressure during the last five days.
NEUT12|Is service now can hold it.
NEUT13|Then crowd strike will hold it.
NEUT14|You'll see Salesforce hold it worked.
NEUT15|Davis reports soon as that will hold it.
NEUT16|An even snowflake.
NEUT17|Could hold it.
NEUT18|I don't know about Zoom video because that's one that a lot of people feel is a Dave cost in stock now, meaning that if there is a vaccine then we won't need zoom as much as we do.
NEUT19|That's true, although we still it's going to be a part of the future in a way that we could not have foreseen eight months ago.
NEUT20|I mean, I read Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and I mean I want to zoom my family.
NEUT21|I don't want it in stock.
NEUT22|I leave is basically portraying a world between now and when we get the vaccine of you better go of lockdown.
NEUT23|It's listen, Joe Biden said it's going to be dark winter so far.
NEUT24|Unfortunately there's nothing that indicates otherwise.
NEUT25|Given the rising case counts staggering, well then what are we going to do?
NEUT26|We just going to go about our lives and just say if we get sick we get sick.
NEUT27|I don't know Jim, you take the you take the everybody has a different perception of risk.
NEUT28|You know that within families everybody has a different perception of risk and.
NEUT29|I've talked about this a number of times and we don't all have the same data that we're drawing from to try to make decisions as to how we act and different states are doing different things.
NEUT30|So your guess is good as mine.
NEUT31|Jim, I don't know.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
