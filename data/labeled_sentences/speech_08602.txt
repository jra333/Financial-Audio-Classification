NEUT0|"""Hi, what's up YouTube channel and share with you?"
NEUT1|My technique that I use to save on commissions when day trading and what I use as my platform to trade.
NEUT2|So I use my laptop which is the Mac air an I use a TD Ameritrade trade architect platform and I like to use the one minute chart and the candle stick graph and so about several shares earlier this afternoon.
NEUT3|Right around here when it was around the like $150.65 range and I don't actually trade on TD Ameritrade, I used to but I wasted a lot of money like 695 matrade to buy in to sell.
NEUT4|So I basically spent almost $14.00 per trade.
NEUT5|So here's a quick example on one of my broker accounts of how I could have saved much more money using the Robin Hood app.
NEUT6|Not paying any commissions because although I made $200 in this buying and selling transaction, I've had to spend.
NEUT7|$14.00 until commissions.
NEUT8|I actually use the Robin Hood app in conjunction with the TD Ameritrade trade architect platform, and So what this allows me to do is see the real time ticker, symbol price and I get to see the red indicated here for resistance and support indicated by the green candle sticks here and so on my iPhone.
NEUT9|I have the Robinhood app which allows me to basically buy and sell.
NEUT10|Stocks for zero Commission.
BULL11|So all I was trying to do today was to improve my dollar cost averaging amount.
NEUT12|So I bought Facebook for a high price of 153 a few days back.
BULL13|And So what I'm trying to do now is I'm trying to buy in at a lower price to improve my dollar cost amount so this account is still brand new an I still have funds getting transferred over, but in the meantime I'm just playing around with some of the features and getting acquainted with how everything works, but.
NEUT14|Hope you enjoyed my quick tip today of using the trade architect platform and using the candle sticks as indicators and to see a real time ticker price an using the Robin Hood app to actually make the Commission free trades.
