NEUT6|OK so I did have this line down here that I wanted to buy AMC off of after it had just run up as you guys know I like buying.
NEUT7|On the down moves not on the run up OK.
BULL8|In the run up, she want to see the pullback, which it did have, so this would have been a good time.
NEUT9|A good day to buy another $9 range and then as you can see it went back to 13.
NEUT10|So just off the knowledge of buying on pullbacks base, you could have made around 50% of your money.
NEUT11|So it did that and then hit this number after market.
NEUT12|But I don't buy aftermarket into buying during the day.
NEUT13|It did hit it, rejected it very hard right?
BEAR14|Very hard came back up so I think there is some more short squeezing that will be going on in GameStop stock because GameStop is the leader of AMC.
NEUT15|AMC really just follows game stock because I think game stock is shorted like over 100%.
NEUT16|And AMC I believe.
NEUT17|Is around like 2030%, so it's not as heavily shorted as GameStop stock is.
NEUT18|So as I'm watching AMC, you also need to watch a GameStop 'cause they will follow each other.
NEUT19|But a price target from game stock is 1000.
NEUT20|And the price target for AMC stock is above 30.
NEUT21|So we did get close to that.
NEUT22|So I am looking for an entry on tomorrow or Tuesday.
NEUT23|I want to see a pull back.
NEUT24|I want to see like a hard day like this one.
NEUT25|I want to see a hard drop like this when I see your hard drive like this.
NEUT26|I'll go ahead and get in because I think this just ahead funds that hedge funds and the market manipulators trying to scare us out of us holding these stocks.
NEUT27|Which we will not be scared to hold, so I'm looking to get in on some more shares.
NEUT28|But I want to see a down day like this one.
NEUT29|OK, I don't really want to see this or something like this.
NEUT30|I want to see that down movement quick and then I would get in around this area.
NEUT31|So my entry point would be that I'm looking for this could change 'cause we really don't know what will happen with this thought 'cause it's very volatile.
NEUT32|So if it goes below $11.00 then I will get in and I would just hold.
NEUT33|I won't put in more than 1%, probably like .05%.
NEUT34|I'm not total portfolio in the stock because really, not sure where it would go.
NEUT35|I do have this Vine area on there but again this is all something different than normal markets so you have to be very careful.
NEUT36|Have a risk management set and just in case it goes to zero you will be fine, OK?
NEUT37|Ovolo 11 I'll be looking to get in and I'll be holding this to above 30 and then I will make a video on GameStop stock tomorrow after the open and also thinking about going live.
NEUT38|So let me know if you got home too alive during the market tomorrow so we can check out GameStop and AMC stuff together.
NEUT39|And also you guys make sure check out my patient page down below when I'm buying selling stocks and remember this time recognition bar so anything is for educational purposes only.
