NEUT0|"""People wanted to get exposure to the stay at home winners."
NEUT1|The 2020 winners.
BEAR2|Are there any that have pulled back significantly?
NEUT3|That sort of jump out to you as as being attractive entry point.
NEUT4|I wish I was on.
NEUT5|I wish I was on with you like a few hours ago 'cause they were.
BEAR6|They were all lower.
NEUT7|But yeah I think like this notion that just because his vaccine we're going to go back to handing each other bricks of filthy dollar bills is kind of silly.
NEUT8|I think.
NEUT9|I think long term winner is PayPal and when they hit that stock because it's like a risk on day or whatever, it's a it's a vaccine day.
NEUT10|That's that.
NEUT11|You want to look for buying opportunities there and you had a big one over the last two days.
BEAR12|Crowdstrike to this idea that we're ever going to have a lessening need for cybersecurity is laughable.
NEUT13|It doesn't matter if there's a vaccine, could have five vaccines, you still are going to need protection, and crowd strike is rapidly taking over this entire market with their their threat graph.
NEUT14|So like those are two stocks that anytime we have those days where all of a sudden people get really excited about buying malls, look, look, look at how read those names are and look for opportunities to get long.
NEUT15|And I would stay long zoom.
BULL16|They hit the stock 30%.
BEAR17|It's ludicrous.
NEUT18|We're not going back to casual business trips every 15 minutes.
NEUT19|Zoom is here to stay.
NEUT20|It's now part of the vernacular.
NEUT21|We zoom each other left and right, and that won't change.
NEUT22|Vaccine or not.
NEUT23|So that's what I would say.
NEUT24|Look at those types of names.
NEUT25|So now the company that makes chains for pens then got it.
NEUT26|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT27|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
