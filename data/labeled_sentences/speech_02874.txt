BEAR2|Say I'm taking a class in school and I'm not doing very well so far.
BULL3|Luckily, if I get a high enough grade on the final exam, there's a chance I may be able to pass the class.
NEUT4|The question is, what grade do I need to get on the exam to raise my average to at least a 70?
NEUT5|We can find out using a feature called Whatif analysis, which allows you to fill in missing information based on the data you already have.
NEUT6|Right now all I know are the grades I got on the 1st 4 assignments, 58 seventy, 72 and 60.
NEUT7|Before we do our analysis, we need to figure out my current average by adding a formula or function in this cell.
NEUT8|In this case, each assignment is weighted equally, so we can calculate the number we need using the average function.
NEUT9|To get the most out of what if analysis, you do need to be fairly comfortable with formulas and functions.
NEUT10|Luckily, this one is pretty simple.
NEUT11|Will just type an = and then average.
NEUT12|Next we need to select all the cells, even the empty cell for the final exam grade.
NEUT13|If we don't, it won't calculate the average for all five assignments.
NEUT14|Looks like we're done, so I'm just going to press enter.
NEUT15|And now we can see my current average.
NEUT16|Unfortunately, it's not high enough, but we knew that was going to happen.
NEUT17|Now we can move on to the next step using a feature called goal seek to figure out what we need on the final exam.
NEUT18|Goal seek is a type of what if analysis that basically lets you work backwards in order to find a missing value.
NEUT19|It starts with the result you want.
NEUT20|Then it calculates whatever input is needed to get you there.
NEUT21|To begin, select the cell that contains your formula or function.
NEUT22|In our case B7.
NEUT23|Then go to the data tab.
NEUT24|And click the Whatif analysis command.
NEUT25|There are actually several different types of what if analysis, including scenario manager and data table.
NEUT26|But in this case we're going to use goal seek.
NEUT27|A dialog box will appear where you can set the parameters for the information you need.
NEUT28|In our example, we want to set cell B7 that's our selected cell.
NEUT29|To a value of 70.
NEUT30|By changing the cell that contains our missing value.
NEUT31|And that's going to be B6.
NEUT32|When you're done, click OK. And go seek will take a minute to see if it can find a solution.
BULL33|Based on the message here it looks like we were successful.
NEUT34|So we're going to click OK. And now we can see the result we were looking for in the final exam cell.
NEUT35|So I guess I need to make a 90 on the exam in order to pass the class.
BULL36|It's going to be tough, but I think I can do it.
NEUT37|At least now I know thanks to the work we did with Whatif analysis.
NEUT38|"It might take some practice to get the hang of the feature on your own, but it's a great way to figure out unknown values in your worksheet."""
