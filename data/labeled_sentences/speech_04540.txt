NEUT0|"""If you ask me what is the tech name that's reporting tonight that has the most capability to absolutely floor people."
NEUT1|I think the name is Amazon.
NEUT2|This could be a.
BEAR3|This could be a situation where they bust the $5 billion operating income number.
NEUT4|That's the top end of the range, right?
BULL5|They could even bust through that this is a stock that's already up 76% this year, and it's like almost a $2 trillion stocks.
NEUT6|That's saying a lot, however.
NEUT7|This is the company that I think has the most potential for upside surprise, because as much as it was fun to walk around in the real world in August in September, with masks on, but returned to a lot of the things that we've been doing.
BEAR8|That doesn't mean that online buying has slowed down.
BEAR9|Doesn't mean demand for Amazon Web Services has slowed down, so I'm looking at this one as potentially the biggest potential upside, surprise, interesting.
NEUT10|So in the same light, then, Weiss is Amazon now.
NEUT11|The safest bet within.
NEUT12|The Big four of the Big 5 big tech.
NEUT13|You know, I. I agree with Josh at the fundamentals are more at their back then than the other companies.
NEUT14|Just because it's so much in demand.
NEUT15|That's the way the world right now.
NEUT16|Unfortunately, it's also got the most strict valuation of any of them.
NEUT17|I own it.
NEUT18|I'm not selling any of it this quarter, like the quarters with the others doesn't mean anything to me.
NEUT19|But yeah, I mean it's got the most risk.
BULL20|"It's got the most reward without a doubt."""
