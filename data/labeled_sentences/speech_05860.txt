NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the."
BULL1|S&P 500 and you can see the market has found support underneath and has rallied with this.
NEUT2|I think the market.
NEUT3|Looks likely to try to go towards 3200.
BULL4|Which is an area here that has been previous resistance and it should open up the door to 34.
BULL5|Pullbacks to 3000 will continue to be supported and therefore I like an opportunity to take advantage of this.
NEUT6|"Just no interest in shorting Federal Reserve is going to keep this thing afloat, no matter what they do."""
