NEUT0|"""And tell me tell me what you think investors should do here."
NEUT1|Let's start with Apple, yeah, so so I think that if you have to look at it, what the stock splits did to the to the market.
BULL2|Kelly, once Apple announced that in Tesla followed one of the market do and ripped higher.
NEUT3|You have to think about where the next 30 to 50% of the profits are going to be.
NEUT4|Coming from.
NEUT5|Not from tech.
NEUT6|It's going to be there.
NEUT7|Cyclicals is going to be the banks.
NEUT8|It's going to be.
NEUT9|The chemical name is going to be the paper container products.
NEUT10|Names like that money so I could ditch the tech.
NEUT11|So say that again Steve, about ditching tech.
NEUT12|So if you think about where you had a lot of games in the overall market, and especially specifically in tech.
NEUT13|So when I say ditch that means take profits, right?
NEUT14|You don't have to sell it all.
NEUT15|Apple Tesla could be long term Holdings, but you could take a 20% peace with it or 30% piece of it and lock in some like that would be the wise thing to do.
NEUT16|Alright, so you'd say to sell 20 to 30% of your Apple of your Tesla if you have it, what about the cyclical place you would recommend people buying into tell me about those?
NEUT17|So I am in a diversified chemical players culture and CEO.
NEUT18|And nothing but Hey, Rock is container and paper products.
NEUT19|Think about what FedEx announced yesterday.
BULL20|27% increase year over year.
NEUT21|Two supply for their higher demand seasonal products right?
NEUT22|So what does that mean?
BULL23|That means Amazon's are going to rally.
NEUT24|That means they're going to need more boxes.
BULL25|That means that Westrock Aloe aloe under the radar name WRC should rip higher from here.
NEUT26|If the I don't know, let's, let's call it.
NEUT27|I don't even call it a rotation 'cause these rotations laugh.
NEUT28|As you said two 3-4 days I think people are just looking for bargains.
NEUT29|This is where the bargains are.
NEUT30|But when you see the rotation last for just a couple of days you think there's a bigger one going on here.
NEUT31|Yeah, I think that this time it's going to be different.
BULL32|Think about how those high flying tech names, how they've ripped higher there in Little Rock 75 to 250%.
NEUT33|All the names that I just tried name alright trust valuation, so people are going to say where am I going to make my profits going forward?
NEUT34|I've already been there, done that with tech.
NEUT35|Let me try something different.
NEUT36|But the truth is, when you look at the overall marketplace, if the Fed comes back in and starts even a bigger stimulus package or the government agrees on something, those names are still going to rally.
NEUT37|And I mean the cyclical names.
NEUT38|Why?
BEAR39|"Because people have had a mass exodus out of them already, and now I'm not going to dip back into the same old tech names."""
