NEUT0|"""I won't pretend to hide Tesla stock can go afford a billion dollar valuation."
NEUT1|Seems kind of crazy, but so do 300 and send it to her.
NEUT2|But here's what you might be missing.
BULL3|The buyers know that Elon Musk will get tested growing that market cap.
NEUT4|I don't know how they know that.
NEUT5|They just do and they won't be dissuaded.
NEUT6|I've always said test.
NEUT7|Is it called stocking effect during the cold last year that that shareholder base isn't going anywhere and neither am I?
NEUT8|Is that circular reasoning absolutely.
BULL9|It's also giving you a monster gain in this one.
BEAR10|Much of the chagrin of short sellers.
NEUT11|Tesla shareholders genuinely believe.
NEUT12|No one else will ever build a better electric vehicle mass trap.
NEUT13|Their messianic zeal knows no bounds, not even the laws of physics.
NEUT14|Finally, there's the leader, the magnificent 7.
NEUT15|Obviously the Yule Brenner Azum video.
NEUT16|What can I say?
NEUT17|This is their economy, the zoom economy and we just live in it.
NEUT18|This company has insane growth, the likes of which I've never seen.
NEUT19|Total meeting minutes on zoom are 30 times what they were last year.
NEUT20|30 company doesn't even have a low single digit penetration of this market.
NEUT21|It's only just begun to monetize all those users.
NEUT22|Most important, every single time you hear the covid cases are on the rise.
NEUT23|These investors who don't care bout valuation by Zoom hand over fist zooms taking the place of Xerox as a technical verb.
NEUT24|It's the greatest story I've seen since the dawn of the personal computer.
NEUT25|Nothing lasts forever, including the markets love affair with magnificent 7 but the bottom line.
NEUT26|Until we turn the corner in the pandemic, the earnings themselves are simply an abstraction for these theses stocks and any disappointment.
NEUT27|Is simply one more reason.
NEUT28|To buy them.
