BULL0|"""Guns or good afternoon SMF MMT."
NEUT1|Here's a monthly chart on this beautiful trend since 2009 at the Bottoms on Netflix and we ran the course.
NEUT2|I want to point out to everyone that any gap up there near needs an after hours.
NEUT3|Today they report little over 20 minutes from now is is that we're going to be a short seller.
BULL4|Yes, they have probably added plenty of more subscribers in the growth channel and more subscribers coming on board and going to put together more pricing packages.
NEUT5|What I'm saying in your short term on Netflix.
BEAR6|Is is that the Mac D that sees blue bars are at 51.26% the 92.63% overbought levels and Netflix on a monthly chart says that it's time to take all the profits off the table that any earnings volatility after hours would be a short up into the top of that and that we're going to be extremely overbought on any gap up on.
NEUT7|Any news that Netflix may have to say.
NEUT8|Meaning, any guidance is that they give will be looking at, but just remember they're spending over a billion dollars in content that their revenue subscription model that money.
NEUT9|That investment that Netflix has been doing.
NEUT10|They need to talk about that relative to profit margins.
BULL11|And not only that, how are they going to sustain the current level in the current environment as we know that there's a time when all the good news is getting fully priced in the name.
BULL12|And Netflix right now hit a high today of $254.98.
NEUT13|Here it is right here.
NEUT14|There's your Netflix right here 254.98 here.
NEUT15|Your Netflix on a monthly chart.
NEUT16|Extremely overbought, we can get to even more extreme overbought areas at that time.
NEUT17|We're looking at taking the bear side of the trade because you can only go so overbought before you have to come down.
NEUT18|Now when we look at it from that level.
NEUT19|We look at it from a level of weekly level.
NEUT20|Let's say let me put up that weekly chart for you soon as I can get it here, I will put it up NFLX NFLX myties after hours is coming.
NEUT21|So here is a weekly chart on Netflix Preview.
BEAR22|We got extremely overbought at 83% up here.
NEUT23|You can see how overbought.
NEUT24|That this chart is.
NEUT25|And this is a weekly chart.
NEUT26|Now I'm going to show you that right now we did have a correction at one time.
BEAR27|We're not nearly as overbought as we were before as far as the percent DS goes, however, there is a disconnect that the weekly and the monthly 'cause we had a correction in Netflix.
NEUT28|A while back, but the monthly is showing a much more over stream.
NEUT29|Scenario.
BULL30|So we do know that the monthly overbought versus a weekly overbought were not nearly as overbought on a weekly as we are in a monthly why, 'cause we've had some big movement here.
NEUT31|In the end, in this bull run.
BULL32|However, we will remain in after hours looking for the opportunity of any volatility price gap to sell.
NEUT33|Ansell short, we will use and take a look at the put options a day after app.
NEUT34|So tomorrow morning instead of getting in ahead of the report.
NEUT35|Rather it wants to get down $25 or gap up $25.
NEUT36|We could care less the gap up though.
BULL37|"We're going to be short selling no matter what on Netflix Netflix is going to have to come through with some very strong numbers to support the current price."""
