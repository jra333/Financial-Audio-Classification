NEUT0|"""Eddie, I want to get to this top headline that we've got this morning from Ray Dalio and see whether it's fact fictional or just calling it as I was calling you book, he would suggest heading into a paradigm shift, taking some of the lines we put them together."
NEUT1|We go into a paradigm shift were real rates are so awful that you'd want to buy gold, but we've got a couple of course 3 notes that this of course suits his whole dynamic theory in terms of his risk parity theory.
NEUT2|But this proposition is real.
BEAR3|Rates are dreadful.
NEUT4|There's going to be huge chase by gold in 40 seconds.
BULL5|I think he's absolutely right.
NEUT6|I think real rates is the main driver for gold we've I've had.
NEUT7|I've had a look at some of the numbers and you know, gold.
NEUT8|What drives Goldfinch intends to change overtime, but what we've seen in the last few months is that the correlation between gold and and real rates is at the highest it has ever been.
BEAR9|"I mean, that tells us people are just really worried about this."""
