BULL0|"""Can California ever regain its lost economic cluster?"
BULL1|The recent election showed a few encouraging signs it might happen.
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT3|No other state has so many assets as California, fantastic climate, dazzling scenery, diverse ecosystems, rich agricultural soil, immense space, abundant water.
BULL4|No wonder it became the most populous and prosperous state in the nation.
NEUT5|If it were a nation, California's economy would be the 5th largest in the world.
BEAR6|But Alas, no other state has done so much to undermine its economy and drive so many people away to other parts of the country.
BEAR7|Shockingly, California has America's highest poverty rate.
NEUT8|Some 30 years ago, Forbes Magazine wrote a cover story warning that the Golden State was taking its prosperity for granted.
BEAR9|With destructive policies, regulations and taxes, it's been downhill ever since.
NEUT10|Only the high tech mech and Silicon Valley has saved the once Golden State from financial ruin, California has committed every economics Indus, Inc. Its economy advised with New York and New Jersey as the highest tax state in the Union.
NEUT11|Its top personal income tax is a suffocating.
BULL12|18.3% and it is toying with the idea of boosting that to over 16%.
BEAR13|Its mandates to force utilities to use alternative energy sources for generating electricity, primarily wind and solar have led to devastating blackouts.
NEUT14|California is a huge bar of out-of-state electricity.
NEUT15|Because of these artificial shortages.
BEAR16|Reckless forest management such as not systematically clearing underbrush, is the critical reason why the state has been afflicted with catastrophic fires.
BEAR17|California's water policy's are perverse, most notoriously, it flush is almost half of its annual rainfall into the Pacific Ocean.
BULL18|That's right, despite perennial headlines about the state's water problems, the state gets plenty of water from rainfall to meet all of its needs, and then some.
BEAR19|California's massive nitpicking regulations have been suffocating businesses, its land use regulations have made housing appallingly expensive, a development that might be approved in a few weeks in Texas takes many years in California.
BULL20|The small raise that things may finally start to change.
BEAR21|A referendum that would have substantially raised property taxes on commercial facilities went down to surprising defeat.
BULL22|Voters made the connection that higher taxes would mean higher rents for stores.
BEAR23|Which in turn would mean higher consumer prices or the stores closing down.
BULL24|A referendum was passed that saved Uber, Lyft, and other users of independent drivers from destruction.
BEAR25|California Democrats and independent observers were stunned that Republicans picked up seats in Congress from California.
NEUT26|Let us hope that these are portents that California can one day become again.
NEUT27|The Golden State.
BULL28|All of us will benefit.
NEUT29|I'm Steve Forbes.
