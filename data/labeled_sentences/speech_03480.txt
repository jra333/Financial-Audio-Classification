NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys, it's your boy will back into the video today."
NEUT1|Today will be talking about ticker symbol G HIV and I'll be giving you guys some key support with resistance levels.
BEAR2|Look forward to tomorrow is a big day on Wednesday, so depending on Wednesday this talk will be the double or it will drop.
NEUT3|So if you're not already in on this play you could probably still get in on the morning tomorrow, but I would really wait.
NEUT4|'cause as you can see my resistance level it's been holding as resistance and this last defense level, like even breaks here.
NEUT5|I will turn bearish, but it hasn't been breaking it.
NEUT6|So it's just been in this range like look.
NEUT7|Like the Lowe's I give you are so clear look how it's been trading in this.
NEUT8|This is like exact price like I'm not going to say I know exactly what the stock market is doing 'cause no one knows but I get very close.
NEUT9|That's why I say you guys want to check out my Patreon page down below to know when I'm buying and selling stocks and also get key support and resistance levels on any stock you want.
NEUT10|'cause I answer all your questions in my Patreon page and we're like a family.
NEUT11|OK so make sure you guys check that out, like the video.
NEUT12|Subscribe to pull some vacation so you don't miss any updates and let's get into it.
NEUT13|So this resistance is at 1291.
NEUT14|The support is at 1254 and this last defense support is at 1228.
NEUT15|And if you knew when I say last defense, that means if it breaks this and keeps going, I turn bearish, not just break it a little bit and pop up, break a little bit, pop up if it breaks it, I turned bearish, if it holds it, I turned bullish, but the main support level is this one right here.
NEUT16|As you can see, it's been trading all through it like this, 'cause I think the stock is waiting for tomorrow to either have that pop up or pop down.
BULL17|So if it is good, news will be able to see a run like this, but I think it will be more than just $4.
BEAR18|I think it might go over $20.
NEUT19|Hopefully I am holding shares below $10.00 so.
NEUT20|Regardless, I am up on profit, but I'm waiting for tomorrow 'cause that's the main reason I got into play.
NEUT21|So tomorrow is a big day, but I'm looking at these levels right here.
BEAR22|So basically, if it breaks, this will be very bullish 'cause it's been.
NEUT23|Hold this for awhile, but if it breaks this and will be bearish and probably will not be playing it.
NEUT24|So these are the levels I'm looking for for GHI, VY, make sure you guys be careful because tomorrow is not certain, so make sure you guys watch out for that and also known as the recommendation of virus or anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT25|"Do not try anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys next time bye."""
