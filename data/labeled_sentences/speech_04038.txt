BEAR0|"""We cannot get Netflix."
BULL1|Yeah, I see that Netflix is moving.
NEUT2|Yeah, so that's trying to take out getting close to those short term highs.
NEUT3|It's funny.
NEUT4|Yeah, the volume is decent, but what's what's funny about this is that once again, right at the top of the list you have all these large cap tech stocks and for you know for the last couple of years we just heard that you know how long can these large cap tech stocks keep leading the market higher and and they are here they are again all right at the top of the radar and so if they if they start going I'm I'm just going to listen to Mark and Ann and put my money there.
NEUT5|But but I mean of course the other thing for Netflix is, well, you have Disney.
BULL6|Plus you have all these other, you know the competitors are getting stronger and stronger.
NEUT7|How much further can they go?
NEUT8|You know in the end they still have a great story there still expanding internationally and if they break out powerfully you know that that that would still be one that I would consider just because you know the markets.
BULL9|Saying rewarding it still yeah and they are reporting earnings in eight days too.
NEUT10|So you definitely want to keep that in mind.
NEUT11|Where would you be pulling the trigger for yourself?
NEUT12|Yeah, that's a I mean with the earnings out.
NEUT13|I would wait until after earnings in this case for for Netflix.
NEUT14|I I would.
NEUT15|I wouldn't bind that first cheat area and that this is just because it's it's.
NEUT16|Netflix is a larger stock and it's not super high on my list.
NEUT17|I'd probably wait closer till the all time highs.
BULL18|In this case it gets after earnings downs breaking out in all time highs.
NEUT19|That's where I would.
NEUT20|I would say, OK, it's it's not just breaking out the smaller consolidation, just as large two year type of base.
NEUT21|"That's where I would strongly consider it then."""
