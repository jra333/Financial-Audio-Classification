NEUT1|Next on your four minute crypto show.
BEAR2|Today shows from a post by Nick Cheung at News BTC and brought to you by etoro well, Bitcoin didn't have the best second half of 2019 plunging from a year to date, high of $14,000 in June to just over $7000 where it sits today, and it's low Bitcoin fell to $6600 as Bitcoin buyers failed to step in amid selling pressure seemingly from Chinese regulation of digital assets.
BULL3|And the operators of a multibillion dollar Bitcoin scam, despite the harrowing backdrop.
BULL4|Bloomberg's Mike Mcglone of the Business Media Giants Intelligent Unit, believes that Bitcoin has a positive outlook heading into 2020 in the next decade due to a confluence of factors.
BULL5|This confluence Mcglown went as far to say, could bring Bitcoin back into the five digit range in the near future, which would be a welcome surprise for many investors in the industry who has begun to think that Bitcoin has re entered a crypto winter state.
BULL6|Bloomberg's Mcglone believes that the bull case for Bitcoin is rapidly building as long as the key support of $6500 holds in the near future.
NEUT7|In fact, the annals went as far to say that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks the key resistance at $10,000.
BEAR8|The Bloomberg analyst drew attention to the fact that his gold rallies so too should Bitcoin, while the precious metal is currently trending lower, having peaked last summer.
NEUT9|In the midst of the trade war talks, the macro picture may start the favor gold and thus Bitcoin heading into 2020.
NEUT10|Mcglone added that a perfect storm is building for Bitcoin in terms of its basic premise of mass adoption.
NEUT11|Anna fixed supply cap.
BULL12|Bitcoin is winning the adoption race among crypto assets.
NEUT13|Ann is becoming increasingly scarce, which favors price appreciation.
BEAR14|He wrote that plenty can go wrong with the Mesa nascent, but unless the basic premise reverses, there's a higher probability to sustain price appreciation versus depreciation.
