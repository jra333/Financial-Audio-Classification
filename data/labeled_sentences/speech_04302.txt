NEUT0|"""What are your thoughts on investment services like The Motley Fool?"
NEUT1|They're heavily advertising and seem to have long term investment by similar to Buffett.
NEUT2|Are these services worth it?
NEUT3|I don't think so and do your own research.
NEUT4|Don't just rely on me.
NEUT5|Please do your own research but.
NEUT6|Motley Fool kind of got started back in the in the 90s.
NEUT7|They were the first kind of notable online repository for investment advice, and I remember the first notable stock they pitched was called Iomega, and I'm dating myself.
NEUT8|Any storage people out there?
NEUT9|You'll understand what that is, which is?
NEUT10|It was just an old cartridge that you could hook up that had a lot of memory on it, which means a couple kilobytes and they actually made a good call on that.
NEUT11|And so they started to sell their services and whatnot, and I don't.
NEUT12|I don't think you should ever take anybody's advice when it comes to buying stocks.
NEUT13|Always do your own research.
NEUT14|Always, always, always, always, please.
NEUT15|And if you don't then what will happen is you'll sell that stock at the worst time you'll panic and you'll be a tourist in the stock.
NEUT16|You'll only be renting it.
NEUT17|You got to be very very long term focused and as Warren Buffett said, the longer the view the wiser the intention.
NEUT18|Always do your own research and I got a quote Buffett again.
BULL19|I got a great one here.
NEUT20|So Warren Buffett said the New York Stock Exchange is the only store in the world where consumers sell stuff when it goes on sale.
NEUT21|Think about that.
NEUT22|It's amazing, it's amazing, so do your own research 1st and just be careful when you go to certain websites and you see what are called sponsored stories.
NEUT23|Those will bias you and I don't take advice from any CEO that goes on a financial news program or has a guest column online because CEOs are the best sales people in the world.
NEUT24|They're not unethical, but they're going to be positive about their company.
NEUT25|Obviously, that's how they got to the top, the great salespeople.
NEUT26|And anybody is interviewed on television that talks about stocks a lot of times their clients could be paying the bills for them, even if there is a Chinese wall separating investment, banking and trading in that company.
NEUT27|Just be careful of that.
NEUT28|Just be careful please or might be a portfolio manager is being interviewed that owns that stock, for example.
NEUT29|So just be careful and I think it's a good exercise for me to take you over to teach you what a sponsored story is.
NEUT30|When when I ran my hedge fund I pay thousands to Bloomberg and then I said no more dude.
NEUT31|We're gonna get everything here from Yahoo Finance.
NEUT32|It's free and get all the same stuff.
NEUT33|However, when you go on to this website, you gotta be careful.
NEUT34|I'm going to look really closely here.
NEUT35|OK, so right here.
NEUT36|This is an ad Cal Raging Bull still around.
NEUT37|You've got sponsored stories everywhere.
NEUT38|Just be careful that and by the way, a newspaper I recommend reading for just high level how the world works.
NEUT39|It is the FT.
NEUT40|But when you look at this newspaper, I don't want you to read anything that tells you what to buy or sell like don't read interviews with money managers.
NEUT41|What I want you to do is only read articles that tell you how the world works and nothing more.
NEUT42|And always, always, always do your own research.
NEUT43|Please, please and be a long term investor.
NEUT44|Trading doesn't work.
NEUT45|"Please don't trade stocks."""
