NEUT0|"""We're going to analyze Coca Cola and Pepsi as investments, and we're going to do it all in 90 seconds."
NEUT1|You want to keep up with stocks, but you don't have the time to read a lengthy report on every company that interesting.
BEAR2|You're busy.
NEUT3|I get it.
NEUT4|I respect that.
NEUT5|So I took the most important considerations from my research and packed it into 90 seconds uses to decide if it's worth your time to research further to keep up with stocks you already own or did this check in with some of the largest companies in the world.
BEAR6|Fair warning, I'm obviously going to fast, so if you need to slow down your playback speed on YouTube, that's fine.
NEUT7|Go ahead and do it now.
NEUT8|Let's put the Clock.
NEUT9|And let's do this.
NEUT10|Coke and Pepsi are both primarily known for their classic battle to be the dominant soft drink.
NEUT11|As of this taping, they both have a market capitalization between 150 and $200 billion.
NEUT12|They both pay dividends around 3.5%.
BULL13|They're both projected to grow about 14% next year, compared to the industries 11% in the markets, 12%.
NEUT14|So if you're considering investing in the beverage industry, who do you choose, Coke or Pepsi?
NEUT15|That is the question here.
BULL16|A couple reasons you might prefer Coke, although both maintain a fairly ugly debt profile coaxes quite a bit better with a debt to equity of 2.3 versus Pepsi's four and earnings before interest in taxes about.
BULL17|84 times their annual interest payment compared to past 11 times.
BULL18|Coke is also undeniably one of the most recognizable companies in the world.
NEUT19|But here are a couple of reasons you might prefer Pepsi.
BULL20|The company in the recent past has been much more efficient with their money with an ROAE of 45% versus Coke.
NEUT21|6% and ROA of 7% Versus Coast 1%.
BULL22|Anna projected ROI over the next three years of 69% versus coax 47% last year.
BEAR23|Both companies had negative earnings growth.
BEAR24|Pepsis was quite a bit less at negative 27% compared to coax negative 80% by simple traditional metrics.
NEUT25|Both appear to be fair to a little overvalued.
NEUT26|Pepsis PE is 31 versus the beverage industry is 24 in the market.
BEAR27|18 compared to Coke speed of almost 150 and with Pepsi's diversification into the food industry, the companies more insulated as people are buying fewer and fewer sugary drinks.
NEUT28|Both companies seem to offer investors relatively similar valuations today and similar prospects for the future, and it shouldn't be forgotten that both are dividend aristocrats.
BULL29|Having increased their dividend every year for more than the last 25 years.
NEUT30|But if you had to choose and not on taste Coke or Pepsi.
