NEUT0|"""Every 14 year old right now on Instagram, has entrepreneur listed on their bio?"
NEUT1|It's a hot thing in this country, but if you don't push everything into this, it's really putting every single oz you have because you know it will work.
NEUT2|I started inventing probably when I was like around 12 or 13.
NEUT3|I used to write down at least four ideas a day.
NEUT4|Everything from ecofriendly ideas, sustainable ideas and I used to go to Michaels and like carve out objects and try and create something tangible.
NEUT5|I knew I needed to move into more, so the inventing and business development stages soon after, Noble essentially is a single use.
NEUT6|Water soluble drop contains shampoos, conditioners, body washes and shaving creams.
NEUT7|How did the idea in my biology Class A few years back and basically the concept is you take a single use drop in your hands under shower water?
NEUT8|Immediately melt the outer casing and it forms a very luscious and lathering shampoo.
NEUT9|You apply it and use it accordingly.
NEUT10|I think Noble as a whole has this very very select focus to create sustainable ecofriendly products.
NEUT11|Right now if you look for an eco friendly shampoo bottle yellow options are limited to maybe five different types to minimum orders or 25,000.
NEUT12|Most customers would never order 25,000 for those life of them.
NEUT13|In less they are like PNG or Yuna lever or whatnot.
NEUT14|It's just not possible.
NEUT15|It's way too expensive to start.
NEUT16|Our unique advantages were bringing a product, but this is stainable niche are really perfect for hotels to reduce their waste San just very simple to keep account of.
NEUT17|Actually how much product you using for a lot of businesses where this is what they live on.
BEAR18|Four out of five people say they don't consistently recycle any items from their bathroom.
NEUT19|That's equivalent to 1200 football stadiums every year of just shampoo bottle wastes in the US alone.
NEUT20|I'd love to go completely 100% waste free.
NEUT21|That's my goal.
NEUT22|Every single person loves the word stain ability.
BEAR23|It's such a hard thing to achieve.
NEUT24|There's a million new technologies out there.
NEUT25|Problem is, scaling all of them.
NEUT26|People see us as the means of creating new products.
NEUT27|So sustainability is really heavily wanted.
NEUT28|It's you know, it's a beautiful image.
NEUT29|You need the next generation of inventors and entrepreneurs to create the best products out there.
NEUT30|The newest product, the newest brands that the world has never seen, things that we're not used to seeing on shelves.
NEUT31|"There's going to be something different coming."""
