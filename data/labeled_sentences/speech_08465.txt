BULL1|This first round matchup pits Teiva Pharmaceuticals the massive Israeli generic drugmaker against YRC Worldwide.
BULL2|The American Trucking Company this is a compelling match up in that you have a very large company.
NEUT3|$48 billion teba taking on what on the face of it is a small trucking company now, why do I say a small trucking company when in fact YRC Worldwide is quite a large trucking company that measures up to the Fortune 500.
NEUT4|The reason is this YRC Worldwide.
BEAR5|Has lost a lot of value an I mean a lot of value over the last few years, so the market capitalization of YRC Worldwide is down to less than $500 million.
BEAR6|In fact, it's down to less than $300 million.
BEAR7|This is a stock YRC Worldwide, which is reverse split itself that is declined from about 1005 years ago to just four today.

NEUT10|If I'm forced to pick one of these two stocks over the next 12 months.
