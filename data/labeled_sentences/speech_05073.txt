BULL0|"""Golden Globes nominations are out and during a year when we were all bingeing our way through lockdowns, the streamers all came out on top."
NEUT1|Netflix crushing the competition.
BULL2|No surprise picking up a grand total of 42 nominations across all categories, which make up 35% of all nominations.
NEUT3|Netflix file pacing, HBO Max, Apple TV, and others Julia Borsten.
NEUT4|This is your world listen.
NEUT5|Here's the thing, and some of these shows are great.
BEAR6|I've seen some of them, but Netflix had shows to show US production is all but shut down.
NEUT7|I mean, how important was it?
NEUT8|That they just simply had a catalog of shows that they hadn't shown before.
NEUT9|Will look most of the shows that we all watch this year were made long before this year, so I think that the content that we've been doing this, you're really hasn't been impacted by those production shutdowns and there have been plenty of productions that have gone up and running again.
NEUT10|But Brian, what I think is so amazing about these Netflix numbers.
BULL11|I mean they have more than doubled the number of nominations this year than they had last year, and that these are nominations across both film and TV.
BEAR12|Part of that is that a lot of the films that were supposed to get distributed in theaters this year were delayed, so maybe there was less competition.
NEUT13|But to me this really speaks to the fact that Netflix is investing an estimated $17 billion in content.
NEUT14|Last year, they're spending so much content on everyone more than anyone they're out spending, and they have simply more content.
NEUT15|Yeah, we're starting to see that really play out in these kinds of awards races.
BEAR16|Yeah, I'm kind of struggling for something to fight.
NEUT17|I mean, I'm basically binge watching the office on Peacock and and British Soccer.
NEUT18|What do you guys Julia will go around the horn real quick?
NEUT19|Julie, what?
NEUT20|What do you like right now your this is your world.
NEUT21|Well, I would say I'm going to point out some of the news services on some of these streamers.
BULL22|Apple TV Plus got a number of nominations for Ted Lasso.
BULL23|That is a great feel.
BULL24|Good show on Apple TV.
NEUT25|Plus is only Apple's second year in the game.
NEUT26|I didn't see any nominations for Peacock but will be interesting to see how all these new players start to get more attention.
NEUT27|Yeah, we'll get it every step producing shows, which is tough.
NEUT28|I saw I saw what I saw Steve show called the flight Attendant which I wanted to hate but actually was just.
BULL29|We're just good.
NEUT30|I was like to sit on the couch and I recently got some nominations also, which is what you want.
NEUT31|The flight attendant.
NEUT32|What do you think, Steve?
NEUT33|What do you like?
NEUT34|I haven't seen the flight attendant, although my wife was obsessed with it.
NEUT35|The Crown was the one I was happy to see that with this season of the Crown was about as perfect television as you could get.
BULL36|It was Sopranos level good and it's no shock that it that it swept up all those nominations an it really like Julie was saying speaks to Netflix's ability to buy itself into these awards.
NEUT37|It's amazing.
NEUT38|Thank you know what?
BULL39|Thank you Steve.
NEUT40|I actually forgot I've never seen one.
NEUT41|Sopranos never not.
BEAR42|I've never seen Breaking Bad for Sopranos now.
NEUT43|I guess I got stuff to watch.
NEUT44|No, you're missing out Brian.
NEUT45|Please not leave a new.
NEUT46|At least not leaving New York till 2042.
BEAR47|Apparently don't get happy.
