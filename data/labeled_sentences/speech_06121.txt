NEUT0|"""Yeah, I mean it's as Mike said, the March manufacturing."
BULL1|I assume the best in 38 years and then underneath the surface it's new orders and production best level since 2004 backlog also very very nice.
NEUT2|So manufacturing is absolutely humming.
NEUT3|You actually don't need an infrastructure bill, I don't think so.
NEUT4|My point is if you add infrastructure on top of the great data that we're getting, you're going to really see a almost like a super cycle in industrials, in manufacturing, in commodities.
NEUT5|And I think that's really why you want to have exposure.
BEAR6|These stocks industrials, for example, have outperformed the technology sector.
BULL7|Industrials are up 11% on the year energies, up 33%.
BULL8|The financials are 16%, and tech is up 3.75%.
NEUT9|So is it a mean reversion today and yesterday?
BEAR10|Certainly they came down really far, really fast.
NEUT11|You want to have exposure to technology, but you also have want to have exposure to some of the parts of the economy that are really going to benefit as we get more and more stimulus into the system, and we see a little more inflation a little higher interest rates.
NEUT12|By the way.
NEUT13|Caterpillar, just.
BULL14|There's a rumor out there that Caterpillar is going to raise pricing across the board.
NEUT15|That's also a very powerful theme for the industrial sector and for the cyclical sector.
BULL16|There's been all kinds of supply chain disruptions, and on top of that you have better demand, and so you're going to see pricing power in these sectors in my opinion.
BULL17|Yeah, for consumer stocks as well, Micron shares are rallying today after earnings beat Anna Bullish Outlook.
NEUT18|Let's hit that name with Josh Lipton and some details Josh.
BULL19|Sarah Micron beating expectations.
BULL20|Really seeing strength across the board here from data center to automotive analysts, noting that demand is now outpacing supply in the DRAM market.
BULL21|That's driving improving pricing trends.
BULL22|They say stock rallying 130% over the past year.
NEUT23|Separately, the Journal is reporting that Micron and Western Digital or exploring a potential deal for kyok CIA for 30 billion.
NEUT24|That's the Japanese chip company.
BULL25|SMH, by the way, now more than 15% this year, closing out six straight months of gains.
NEUT26|Yesterday, back to you all.
NEUT27|Josh Lipton, Josh thank you.
BULL28|It looks like it is the strongest SMP industry Group right now in the market up 3% staff.
NEUT29|How does Micron look and some of the other semi names as well caught in the crosshairs of this whole supply chain issues shortage.
NEUT30|We know the White House is pretty focused on it and having a meeting on it as well, yeah?
NEUT31|With within technology, I'm very overweight, semis and semi cap equipment for this exact reason.
BEAR32|Microns numbers were outstanding.
BULL33|They talked about tightness in DRAM, NAND hasn't even really starting to see an improvement, and that's coming in the second half of the year.
NEUT34|Ioan Lam research.
NEUT35|I own XP, I own Broadcom.
BULL36|The bigger news to me was TSMC putting in $100 billion in to expand capacity over the next three years.
NEUT37|This is on top of 28 billion that they're going to put in this year alone and on top of Intel's 20 billion plan.
NEUT38|In terms of expansion and Samsung over the next decade, 116 billion in terms of capacity expansion, we're going to have a lot of this stuff at some point it's going to be a lot, but for now it's a function of better demand and also the shortages in supply.
NEUT39|We know the auto industry, for example.
BEAR40|They're going to lose $60 billion because of the shortages of supply this year alone, so they've got to get it back going.
NEUT41|I thought the CEO's comments of tea at from TSMC was very interesting in terms of them being over 100% utilization rates, so it's going to take time.
NEUT42|But these are why you want to.
NEUT43|Own some of these other supply chain names based off this news.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
