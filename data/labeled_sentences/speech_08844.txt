NEUT0|"""It's claim this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, another day for Apple and another I don't want to say a failed balance.
NEUT5|Maybe that's probably being a little too dramatic, but I mean not, not.
NEUT6|The bonds that I think a lot of people probably want to see it happen, you know, play out to be.
NEUT7|I mean, this thing was behaving very, very nicely.
NEUT8|And then, like I said, it's not like it crashed.
BEAR9|But a bit of a pullback.
NEUT10|There were almost gave back half of that bounce, which brings about, you know, an interesting level that I'm curious about moving forward and that is, can the price.
BULL11|At least they up above this area right here at the 117 mark?
NEUT12|Because if it doesn't say above 117, this is just I'm just.
NEUT13|I bought it and that basically means it's given up 50% of the bounce.
NEUT14|I mean right here if it goes, if it went, you know if that was quote unquote the balance.
BEAR15|But then it Drake breaks down below 117.
NEUT16|That's all of a sudden, 50% of that gain disappears.
NEUT17|Now does that mean from the big picture of things?
NEUT18|Does that mean that Apple is going to go bankrupt as the company?
NEUT19|Of course not.
NEUT20|I'm just saying that strictly from a trading perspective, using the technical chart that would be, you know, an area that I would want to see hold strong from the support side of things.
BULL21|If it does not hold strong for the next level of support as I've talked about in past videos.
NEUT22|Would be down there around the 1:15 fifty mark so keep an eye on those couple of levels support wise as far as areas of resistance are concerned, main level to watch which I believe I talked on past videos is that purple line right there.
NEUT23|The 50 per and moving average.
NEUT24|Not shocking to see you can see that.
NEUT25|I mean really history repeat itself right there.
NEUT26|Price got close to it, didn't even hit it.
NEUT27|Fell back right there.
BEAR28|Close to it, didn't even hit it fell back and then once again today close to it.
NEUT29|Didn't quite hit it and fell back so that's definitely the main battle.
BULL30|Going to watch from the resistant side of things but on all Apple did show some signs of strength that's great.
NEUT31|Pulled back a bit too much, but who knows if they can stay above 117 then you gotta think there's a chance for a you know bigger type.
NEUT32|Move to the upside to come but we'll see how things play out on Wednesday.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including.
BULL36|How I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT42|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live.
NEUT45|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT46|Then I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT47|If you have any questions.
NEUT48|"Let me know if not I'll be seeing you soon."""
