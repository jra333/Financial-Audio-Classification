BULL0|"""It's it's a good volume, but it's not as high as average volume at 9 million."
NEUT1|So for some reason.
BEAR2|There's not as much trading going on now when you look at the 52 week low were actually down all day to $97.00 out of its two week low.
BULL3|Right now we're actually at the 52 week high.
NEUT4|That's why we could see the 52 week highs or $132.
NEUT5|We're pretty close to that, so we look at the market cap market cap closer 200 billion.
NEUT6|So Disney definitely has a lot of money.
BULL7|We look at the PE ratio looking healthy dividend looking great.
NEUT8|Now.
NEUT9|See when you look at the news, we can see that most mostly what they're going to be talking about when it comes to Disney is Disney's Disney's streaming service.
NEUT10|That's essentially the main news as of lately, when we look at the analyst, the analyst talking about how Disney 27 analysts among the 27 analysts ratings 78% are saying it's by 78%.
NEUT11|We look at the whole 22%, zero percent are saying it's a cell, so none of them are saying that it's a cell.
BULL12|Essentially, when we look at the Morningstar them by rating, we can see that there stare saying that the parks and resorts segment has rebounded strongly from the recession and the opening of Disneyland Shanghai should provide additional momentum, although making movies is a hit or miss business.
BULL13|Disney's Large Library of content with popular franchises and characters reduces this volatility over time.
BULL14|The addition of the Star Wars franchise broadens the demographics that the company can address.
BULL15|Additionally, Disney strong distribution and merchandising capabilities should help to speed the monetization of the Lucasfilm acquisition.
BULL16|So that's good news.
BEAR17|Now what the haters from Morningstar at, say the haters the haters are saying that increases in the cost of popular programming such as sports events in television series could adversely affect margins at ESPN and ABC.
NEUT18|The business model for the media networks depends on the continued growth of the retransmission and verse compensation fees.
BEAR19|Any slowdown in the growth of these fees?
NEUT20|Perhaps because the pay television business?
BEAR21|Begins to shrink would hurt the profitability of the segment developing mass market hit programs can be unpredictable, especially as the media fragmentation continues now.
BULL22|When we look at the Morningstar report, we can actually see they're saying that the aggressive Disney launch will should serve Disney well over the long run marks.
BULL23|Forgives Disney Three stars out of five.
NEUT24|This was only four days ago.
NEUT25|Now when you look at the economic model wide, Disney has a wide variety of merchandise and products and services.
NEUT26|Ann Disney just has a lot to offer as a company.
NEUT27|The Fair value day.
NEUT28|Date and Morningstar.
NEUT29|They think the price is actually kind of where it's at right now, so if you're looking if you want to believe in Morningstar's price target, I would just sell it at 1:30 whenever it falls below 130 by whenever it goes to 1:30.
NEUT30|So so that's essentially what we're talking about.
NEUT31|Their uncertainties medium and their stewardship is standard now if you want me to read the full report, leave a comment below.
