BEAR0|"""SEC is preparing to Sue that crypto startup for selling unlicensed securities."
NEUT1|The asset in question here is called XRP.
NEUT2|It's a cryptocurrency, much like Bitcoin.
NEUT3|Ripple uses it for its clients, which are mostly businesses and banks.
NEUT4|To send instant payments across borders.
NEUT5|Eight years ago, when Ripple was founded, they decided to create their own digital currency.
NEUT6|To do that, Bitcoin, they say wouldn't work.
BEAR7|They said it was too slow.
NEUT8|They began selling the new cryptocurrency over scheduled periods of time, which helped fund the business.
NEUT9|Ripple still owns the majority of this cryptocurrency.
BULL10|The startup also raised cash from some big name VCs, including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz.
NEUT11|It now has a $10 billion valuation ripples.
NEUT12|Founders never registered XRP as a security before selling it to other investors.
NEUT13|They argue it's more like a utility and that it's a currency, meaning it wouldn't be.
NEUT14|It would be regulated by the CFTC and not the SEC.
NEUT15|No comment yet from the SEC, but I'm told their argument is that XRP was an investment contract.
NEUT16|People bought it with the expectations that they were getting a piece of Ripple.
NEUT17|The company Tyler back to you.
NEUT18|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT19|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
