NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol UVXY."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first area and let me take a step back.
NEUT8|I will say this is a very tricky charts talk about 'cause there's a lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT9|What do I mean by that?
NEUT10|Well, if you're some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalp or whatever yourself, and you bought right there in your plan was to buy and sell within, you know 8 minutes.
BEAR11|Well, from our perspective the chart looks really really bad.
NEUT12|Now if you care about the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|I get it from the highs.
BULL14|There has been a larger pullback, but from the grand scheme of it all the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT15|And that's how long term options are constructed.
NEUT16|Just higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time, and that's going to be the viewpoint that I talked about things from.
NEUT17|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had a trap mentality going into all this, and I'm not saying that all this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
BEAR18|Saying, let's say that the price comes down here to $11.80.
NEUT19|So price comes down here to 1180 behaves in that manner, then start to work its way back up right now.
NEUT20|Emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT21|What would you have while you have a set of those right there, you'd have Lowe's right there.
NEUT22|You'd have those lows down there if you envision each one of those stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT23|Well, from the big picture, you would still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And that's the name of the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL26|Overtime, it's going to make progress.
NEUT27|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress being right there at 1180.
NEUT28|Again, I get it.
NEUT29|If you're a day trader.
NEUT30|And you bought right there, you don't care bout these stair steps, but that's why I try to offer up a warning that I would be coming from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT31|So yeah, today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day taking a step back and look at multiple days as you're doing here.
BEAR32|You can see the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher low.
NEUT33|So let's see if the pricing get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT34|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT36|But it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT45|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT46|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT47|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
