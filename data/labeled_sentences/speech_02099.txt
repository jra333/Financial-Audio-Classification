BEAR0|"""Coca Cola beating on earnings estimates needing on revenue."
BULL1|But importantly, I think this is the biggest statement of all from Coca Cola.
BEAR2|Reinstating guidance for the year for the first time since the pandemic crisis really took a chunk out of Coke's business.
BULL3|And they do see a return to growth both on organic revenue, which is the key measure for consumer companies to return to high single digit growth this year.
BULL4|An for earnings growth to return to 10 and a half percent.
BULL5|The stock is a little bit higher in the pre market trading.
NEUT6|I'll give you some color on that.
NEUT7|Porter I just talked to James Quincy, the CEO and Chairman of Coca Cola.
BEAR8|He said lockdowns continue to drive the quarter.
NEUT9|That's what put pressure on this business because half of Coke's business comes from away from home, the restaurants, the stadiums, the movie theaters, however, and he noted this was really important this quarter.
BEAR10|Coca Cola only saw global unit case volume declined 3%, which is a huge improvement from what they were seeing in prior quarters during the pandemic.
NEUT11|Why, he said they've learned to adapt and what he meant by that is a lot of their clients.
NEUT12|The quick service restaurants, for instance.
BULL13|Have figured out delivery and takeout and that makes a big difference for Coca-Cola.
BULL14|The at Home Channel which he calls it has done relatively well.
BULL15|He said they've managed to increase share because they figured out what the consumer wants.
BULL16|Multi packs are doing really well.
NEUT17|People are going out to clubs like the Costco's and stocking up more completely changed consumer behavior versus the smaller individual cans that we used to see.
BULL18|For instance growing in the convenience stores.
NEUT19|So some of those changes are what drove the better performance during the quarter.
NEUT20|It also is what gives him confidence.
NEUT21|To say, and he made this point to me, James Quincy, that they expect to return to growth levels of 2019 ahead of where the global economy is expected to return to growth levels of 2019.
BULL22|So yes, Coca Cola is tide to the overall economic environment and what they saw in the quarter was a better growth in China versus Europe where we saw lockdowns and US kind of in the middle.
NEUT23|But they do expect as a result of some of their restructuring plans that they've gone through, including layoffs and focusing on bigger, faster growing brands like.
NEUT24|Topo Chico.
NEUT25|They're making a big bet on hard seltzer too early.
BULL26|James Quincy told me to see any results there, but they continue to look like a solid launch.
NEUT27|They're going to release Co coffee so more innovations coming and hopefully more opening up of the world of businesses and of events should be helping Coca-Cola guys, I just want to mention another really important headline out of this release which I can give you a little context on.
BEAR28|Coke is going through a major legal battle with the IRS in back taxes.
NEUT29|It's one of the reasons why.
BEAR30|The stock got a number of downgrades from analysts over the quarter.
BEAR31|Because this is going to be costly, Coca-Cola is putting out a worst case scenario here in this release that it could cost the company $12 billion if the IRS completely wins.
NEUT32|Now, James Quincy CEO told me that they don't expect to lose this case that they think they have a hard solid case, and they don't expect that number to come to fruition.
NEUT33|But they wanted to lay it out because it is weighing on the stock and on the outlook it is an overhang of uncertainty.
NEUT34|He also expects this legal battle Joe to go on for a few years.
NEUT35|And I would say as far as that $12 billion number the analysts were projecting anywhere from 10 to 13.
NEUT36|So it should be in line and priced into the stock.
NEUT37|Which is why, perhaps you're not seeing any kind of negative reaction there, but it is important because it's a huge chunk, about 5% of Coke's market cap.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
