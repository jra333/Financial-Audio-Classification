NEUT0|"""I think it's important for people to understand that unlike a competitor that a lot of people worry about for years and years, the money that you have right now will get you to that expansion that you're talking about."
BULL1|Indeed, this is an amazing outcome from a from our merger process with Churchill Capital and we secured four and a half billion dollars through both spank and the pipe with an unprecedented array of blue chip investors.
BULL2|And that really secures the future of lucid Anan.
NEUT3|I mean, this is very interesting because that competitor was only able to secure several 100,000,000 at IPO, and it meant that it had to will look for fresh injections of capital.
BULL4|Many times, and with this capital we secure our future well into 2023 we can implement phase two of the factory in Arizona.
NEUT5|We can add you know more than two and a half thousand hourly and salaried manufacturing employees.
BULL6|We can bring all four trim levels of lucid air into production and we can get project gravity well along the path to production with prototypes builds.
NEUT7|And a lot of testing under our belt.
NEUT8|And then there's a sales and service and R&D activities that we have got a very clear runway with the security of funding in a Valley.
BULL9|Very healthy position.
NEUT10|You and I both know that the internal combustion engine is is a Dinosaur.
NEUT11|You also know that you and I know that the demand for cars like lucid are big.
NEUT12|Let's say an Apple were to come in would would loosen have problems selling cars if the great Apple came in.
NEUT13|Well, there's always room for for new entries Ann, and don't let underestimate the market because this isn't a market for ivys.
NEUT14|There's no such thing as an EV market.
NEUT15|This is a market for cars and E. These will penetrate and completely fill that that market at world market for cars.
NEUT16|So I'd welcome the competition from a company like Apple, but ultimately you know this is a technology race.
NEUT17|Tesla recognizes that, and Lucid recognizes that.
NEUT18|And I think that's what differentiates so many of the traditional car companies.
NEUT19|They buy parts off the shelf.
NEUT20|They take a commoditised approach to this loose.
NEUT21|It doesn't.
NEUT22|It's all in house, all it has developed design engineer and manufacture vertically.
NEUT23|Integrate your core IP only.
NEUT24|Tesla does that today.
