NEUT0|"""But first, let's start with the daily chart of the Dow Board."
NEUT1|Dow Jones industrial average because Fitz likes what he's seen right here.
NEUT2|Right now.
NEUT3|The Dallas breaking out from what is known as a symmetrical triangle pattern.
NEUT4|It started when the index peaked back in July.
NEUT5|Since then it's been making a series of lower highs and higher lows, and this is called a classic continuation pattern, meaning that the Dow is merely resting before resuming its long March higher resting, resting, resting, taking a nap ZZZ.
NEUT6|Most securities tend to move in phases.
NEUT7|You get a monster rally fall by consolidation phase traders take profits sooner.
BULL8|Later the supplier stock for sales exhausted now demand results in another leg higher, meaning there's not enough overhead stock, so they come in.
NEUT9|They buy and that's how the stock moves up or index.
NEUT10|That's what the downstream right now.
NEUT11|When you get this kind of breakout, Fitzpatrick says you want to buy as early in the process as possible.
NEUT12|What makes him so confident?
NEUT13|For one thing, there's the volume the Dow tends to break.
BEAR14|Out, it tends to decline in week five and rally on strong vibe, and that's a sign of increased buying activity.
NEUT15|Plus, when you measure the July peak to the August lows, the Dow's recent range is 1900 points.
NEUT16|OK, so you can see the August lows and see where it's done.
BULL17|Technicians like Fitzpatrick alright.
BULL18|It's a good looking chart.
NEUT19|Add that number to the odds.
NEUT20|The old ceiling positions, giving them a measured move price target, which in this case could take.
NEUT21|The Dow to 2900.
NEUT22|Oh boy, that is an extremely bullish forecast, isn't it?
BULL23|But it makes sense to me now that we've taken the recession fears off the table.
NEUT24|And the Fed is very much our friend.
NEUT25|That's Nirvana.
NEUT26|There's no reason why I can't go up.
NEUT27|If the Dow Jones Industrial Average is ready to work, which will its components of the components that we should get involved in, which are the ones that could actually lead the charge?
NEUT28|Now this is where I differ with fits, but I'm going to give you what he says, brings us back to The Dalles dividend stocks Walgreens Boots, Dow Chemical, and Verizon.
