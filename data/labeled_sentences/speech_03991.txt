NEUT0|"""You may have heard a lot of talk about GameStop."
BEAR1|It's a David and Goliath battle between Wall Street, Financial Elite and some small investors.
BULL2|People have banded together online to drive up the stock price of GameStop money losing Shane, a video game stores that company's stock was trading for less than $20 a share and then recently it began to soar as investors snapped it up on Wednesday.
NEUT3|It closed it almost $350.00 a share.
NEUT4|Jackson Prasco explains how and why.
NEUT5|This all happened.
NEUT6|This was the week Wall Street.
NEUT7|Got a run for its money, social media average Joes versus big money players?
NEUT8|And guess what?
BEAR9|The Army of Average Joes are winning so far those average Joes have been on a buying spree, snapping up shares of troubled companies, BlackBerry, AMC theatres, American Airlines and the Big One GameStop the struggling video game retailer.
NEUT10|Gamma blue collar investor base.
NEUT11|So I I scrap all the time.
NEUT12|But now when you get some like this is one of those all end type things.
NEUT13|For days the little guys have been cashing in all while hedge funds lose billions, it's just a way of attacking wealthy people.
BEAR14|And you know, I think it's inappropriate.
BULL15|We all got to work together and pull together.
NEUT16|You see, unlike average investors, big hedge funds can actually profit from a struggling business.
NEUT17|It's called shorting.
NEUT18|If a stock price drops, they make money, but if the price rises, they stand to lose.
NEUT19|That's where reddits Wallstreetbets message board enters the story.
BEAR20|When users saw hedge funds had bet against GameStop and others.
BULL21|They banded together to buy shares, raising the price and reaping the rewards.
NEUT22|There is something to be said about the fact it did.
NEUT23|Pretty much anybody can do it too, and watching them do it collectively, certainly.
NEUT24|Something to show.
NEUT25|Ironically, this modern day Robin Hood Tale also involves a stock trading app called Robin Hood which small investors used to snap up all that shorted stock, but the hero turned villain as Robin Hood and other brokerage sites suddenly banned users from trading the most volatile shares, shutting out anyone who wanted to cash in.
NEUT26|Amateur investors are really necessary for the health of the market too, so you want them in the market, but you don't want them.
NEUT27|Triggering irrational results, risky as their investments may have been, those amateur investors turned the financial world upside down by finding a way to beat Wall Street at its own game.
