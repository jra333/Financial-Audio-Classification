BULL0|"""Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a great in Van Tastic day today."
NEUT1|If you're new here to the channel.
NEUT2|Welcome to market craze tradings.
NEUT3|My name is Steven.
NEUT4|If you're returning member, welcome back.
NEUT5|Alright everyone so today we're going to be talking about the company BlackBerry Ticker symbol BB didn't know BlackBerry is part of the little scheme that read it is trying to pull and not really a scheme but it operation that red is trying to pull on the hedge funds that they're trying to kind of make them collapse, which again I'm all four.
NEUT6|I recently actually got out of BlackBerry because it kind of crashed.
NEUT7|As you can see but guys.
NEUT8|I think by the end of the year BlackBerry is going to be a long term hold.
BULL9|OK, but I think by the end of the year BlackBerry could seriously be a huge win for us if we hold in the long term.
BEAR10|Personally, I took my profits and got out of BlackBerry, but I'm seeing dips recently.
BEAR11|If the dips continue, I am going to buy back into BlackBerry and I think in the next couple of days we are going to see a bottom out which is going to be an all time low for BlackBerry in a minute and I think we're going to see around 9 to $10.
NEUT12|And that's whenever we should be buying dips again.
NEUT13|I'm not a financial advisor by any means, but I think we should be buying dips whenever BlackBerry headset all time bottom out.
BULL14|Low BlackBerry has also been doing a lot of things recently with their company that makes him seem like a very good competitor in the phone market.
NEUT15|BlackBerry already takes up a decent amount of the phone market.
NEUT16|I think they take up about a 15% stake in the phone market so they are actually kind of a competitor, at least in the USA market.
BULL17|Which is great and that is a really good thing for investors.
BULL18|Obviously in black Berry has some earnings reports coming up coming up, and I think that will really benefit investors as a whole, and I think that we will see some returns from that an it's going to be a long bumpy Rd, but I think that it will pay off in the end.
NEUT19|I think a price target for black Berry to buy in would be anything under $15, which it currently is.
NEUT20|And if it goes anywhere under $15.
NEUT21|Perfect price target to buy in again.
NEUT22|I am not a financial advisor, but I see BlackBerry being at least a $45.00 stock by the end of the year.
NEUT23|Now there is a chance that BlackBerry could still crash and burn, so this is something you want to keep in mind before you put in $1,000,000 or even $100 in the BlackBerry of $100 is too much of an investment for you.
NEUT24|Please only put in what you are willing to lose.
NEUT25|Again, I'm not a financial advisor but I think that this.
NEUT26|Is just something that you should keep track of.
NEUT27|Please do not put in too much money that you are willing to lose.
NEUT28|Only put in money that you're willing to lose.
NEUT29|What I mean please do not put in your whole life savings.
BULL30|That would be terrible, but I think there is a high chance of BlackBerry is going to succeed in the market today.
NEUT31|I'd like to see what you guys are thinking on BlackBerry.
NEUT32|Do you think that it is going to straight up skyrocket?
NEUT33|Or do you think Black Berry is going to crash and burn?
NEUT34|Go ahead and leave your comments in this in the comment section below.
NEUT35|I'd love to have a conversation.
BULL36|"Start going with you guys, but anyway, I hope you guys have a great rest your day piece."""
