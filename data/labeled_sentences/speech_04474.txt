NEUT0|"""How about this more players."
NEUT1|We got PerkinElmer.
NEUT2|We featured them.
NEUT3|That's a $15 billion company that I think it was a baby Thermo Fisher.
NEUT4|I don't think they like that though.
BULL5|This stocks been a huge long term winner for us an you know they've now got an entire suite of covid tests, including ones that they claimed the most sensitive on the market.
BULL6|PerkinElmer shot the lights out, reported last month, but the stock hit a new high today.
NEUT7|I maybe now you gotta wait for a pullback.
NEUT8|Next up.
NEUT9|Could Dell now this one's a smaller, lesser known diagnosis.
NEUT10|Play 2 PCR tests to rapid antigen tests.
NEUT11|The antigen test once again.
NEUT12|Are less accurate now.
NEUT13|Could else competing directly against Abbott Labs here.
NEUT14|But seeing as we still have a shortage of testing competition.
BULL15|Release number problem, however, the stocks up 275% for the year and it's been a wild trader.
BEAR16|Why not let it cool down a little, especially after a very negative article that just appeared in the New York Times that question the efficacy of one of its rapid tests.
BEAR17|I didn't like that we've got Fluidigm.
NEUT18|That's a tiny ultra speculative life Sciences play with a 6 and change dollar stock Fluidigm as an extraction free spit test for covid.
BEAR19|And while it may be less accurate than a true PCR test.
BULL20|At least you don't have to have a Q-tip stuck up your nostril so far post break while stocks up 95% for the year.
BEAR21|It's still a long way from its all time highs for over the summer.
NEUT22|This thing was briefly at $12.45 in August.
NEUT23|Food I'm.
NEUT24|I don't think that's too risky for me, but if you want something to speculate on, it's worth looking into.
NEUT25|Finally, please don't forget the commercial laboratories in the two of am LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics.
NEUT26|They process so many of these tests, these companies are practically printing money right now because they're pretty much drop.
BULL27|We've had thousands of people that's actually been up serious problem in terms of coping with the pandemic.
BULL28|They've been a bottleneck, but it's also great for LabCorp and Quest shareholders.
NEUT29|They're doing the best they can.
BULL30|Both stocks remain cheap lab Corps doing a fantastic job.
NEUT31|By the way, getting a name as the nation's best personal test company where you do covid tests by Mail with incredibly fast turnarounds, I use them the bottom line with covid spiking in a very good chance that Joe Biden wins the White House Austria.
NEUT32|More test friendly administration.
NEUT33|I bet the testing stocks have a lot more room to run.
