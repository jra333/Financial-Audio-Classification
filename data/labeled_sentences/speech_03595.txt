NEUT0|"""Traders I want to do a quick technical analysis on Google."
NEUT1|And I'm just looking at the price action right here.
BULL2|Tech has been more bullish due to the fact that people are looking at tech as if it's a safe haven.
NEUT3|And so.
BULL4|I do think that we have upside right there.
NEUT5|There is a sector rotation going on though, where people are moving into the financials and Outotec, but text still isn't that week.
BULL6|I think the tech will rally, just not as much but Google right here.
NEUT7|And if you haven't already, go ahead and look at my broad market technical analysis.
NEUT8|It was released just just a couple of minutes ago actually, right before recording this video.
BEAR9|But for Google, right here, this is big gap right here.
NEUT10|I would look for a gap fill straight to the upside right here, and then afterwards we're going to check and see whether it hits this resistance and comes back down.
NEUT11|Or if it has a pull back and then God continues higher, I think having a pullback continuing higher is a more likely scenario, but just keep in mind that we have that gap right there and that's what I'm looking at after it fills the gap then from there will determine what to do next.
NEUT12|So trade structure for right now that I have going on Google.
NEUT13|Very simple, Google for 1480 Strike call June 12, 2020 expiration for $10.40 per share.
NEUT14|So 1040 altogether.
NEUT15|But the reason we're looking at that is 'cause we want to see after his resistance after after filter gap.
NEUT16|Does it continue higher?
NEUT17|If it doesn't, we will sell a call against it and then we will immediately go and turn into a butterfly.
NEUT18|Stressful calendar, eyes butterfly spread celikkol against it and then sell a credit spread against it.
NEUT19|For no extra risk, by the way.
NEUT20|If it continues higher though, than I like this trade structure.
BEAR21|After all time highs OAPs probably going to face some resistance and people will continue pulling out of the tech sector as it gets more expensive and as he stop seeing it as a safe haven and start putting it into financials and other areas of the market that have not gotten up as much.
NEUT22|But after that all time highs, if it still continues going up will just simply turn it into a calendar and diagonal spread or into a diagonal.
BULL23|Threaten will continue higher and higher and higher on this.
NEUT24|Remember these expired two weeks is a quick trade.
NEUT25|Just looking for a quick gap fill right now, but we might roll it into another trade going into a week after that.
NEUT26|But yeah, that's true.
NEUT27|I'm looking at right now.
NEUT28|Just looking for a quick gap fill right there.
NEUT29|I think that we're going to fill the gap and this trade only costs costs less than 1% of the stock price to put on, so I don't see a reason why speculating with this trade would be bad, because if you just risk 1% of your portfolio by the call and.
NEUT30|Afterwards, after fills, a gap will determine what to do next, but it costs less than 1% of the stock price.
NEUT31|You can risk less than 1% of your portfolio in that trade right there, and it doesn't matter if you look in Geo, G, or GOOGL, they're all really just the same thing, but right here also, you need a gap fill.
NEUT32|Bottom right there.
NEUT33|Yeah, keep in mind Google 40 straight call.
NEUT34|June 12, 2020 four 10:40 and after it fills a gap then we will determine whether we want to turn into a calendar, eyes butterfly or whether we want it or whether we think it will continue higher and will turn into a diagonal spread then, or that if you guys have any questions, go ahead and ask me in the comment section.
NEUT35|I'm also on StockTwits guys can ask me over there.
NEUT36|"And happy trading."""
