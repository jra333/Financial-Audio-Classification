BEAR0|"""Weak dollar always means weak recovery."
NEUT1|We when you make an investment if you don't know in five years from now, you're going to get paid in 20 cent dollars.
NEUT2|100 cent dollars, 10 cent dollars or you get less investment.
NEUT3|People always ask me.
NEUT4|Should I invest in gold?
NEUT5|Why would you want to invest in gold in a normal environment with a stable currency?
NEUT6|Answer You wouldn't.
NEUT7|'cause just a block of a metal doesn't pay you interest and the only want it if you're in the jewelry business or you like, put stuff in your cellar.
NEUT8|But so in a normal environment you wouldn't get these hard asset investments.
NEUT9|But an environment where the dollar is fluctuate ING all over the place, you go for that rather than investing in the future.
NEUT10|Doing research and development, a stable dollars what you want.
NEUT11|You don't want to be in.
NEUT12|Up or down just wanted being steady.
NEUT13|It's like saying 60 minutes in an hour you don't want along our 80 minutes.
NEUT14|You don't wanna short our twenty, you want it stable so you know what an hour will give you.
NEUT15|And the same is true of a currency.
NEUT16|So if the US Re link the dollar to gold, which I think it will in the next few years, then I think it's the other currencies.
NEUT17|Do the same thing just because it's convenient.
NEUT18|Every ounce of gold that's been mined is still on this earth.
NEUT19|You can't destroy the thing.
NEUT20|The amount that's mined each year is only about 2% of the outstanding supply, so it's fairly.
NEUT21|Stable terms of intrinsic value, so let's pick a number.
NEUT22|Let's say you fix it at $1500 an ounce.
NEUT23|All that means is if it goes much above $1500 an ounce, the Federal Reserve or Central Bank will tighten up withdraw money if it goes much below 1500, which means there is not enough money out there.
NEUT24|the Fed would print up some more to get it up to 1500.
NEUT25|So it's like a speedometer.
NEUT26|Just keep it steady.
NEUT27|You bring up the Federal Reserve.
NEUT28|What do you think about their latest plan to buy mortgage backed securities you know, is that a good idea or is this?
NEUT29|Do they need to just stop doing this?
NEUT30|They should take to heart what they tell.
NEUT31|Medical students don't harm the patient.
NEUT32|What the Fed doing it is doing now is a definition of insanity.
NEUT33|Something doesn't work, but you keep doing it, hoping that next time it will work.
NEUT34|They don't learn from experience, so manipulating interest rates as a destroy.
NEUT35|The credit markets mean what is the real price of money.
NEUT36|No one really believes anyone in their right mind would buy a Treasury bond 10 years of duration with a 1.8% interest rate with the finances of the US government.
NEUT37|That's what happens when the Fed is manipulating the market, so it's directs capital too.
NEUT38|Government directs capital to big businesses and starves.
NEUT39|The rest of the economy.
BEAR40|Not good.
NEUT41|This market has fewer players anything until Monday, where we would enter a new stage.
NEUT42|Attacks.
NEUT43|Stock pickers mark.
BEAR44|"Welcome to the five dumbest people reported earnings."""
