NEUT0|"""Scott, is it a surprise to see Crown has received a takeover bid?"
NEUT1|Ricardo, I don't think it's a surprise to anybody.
NEUT2|Of course we know that Packers been shopping Crown around a little bit already, including we're sorry black, so should say taking almost a 10% stake.
NEUT3|Last year.
NEUT4|They were clearly interested in fishing around.
NEUT5|They put their foot on the stock and today a takeover offer $11.85.
NEUT6|Is that a good deal?
NEUT7|Because as you mentioned, didn't Crown put itself on on the selling board.
NEUT8|Essentially when it made public that deal with win a few years ago.
NEUT9|Yeah, like it really.
NEUT10|You know, I think it's any real surprise that James Packers happy to get out of Crown.
NEUT11|And frankly the rest of the board.
NEUT12|Happy to take a good price if they get it.
NEUT13|Is it a good price?
NEUT14|It's a hard one 'cause we've seen.
BEAR15|Of course, it's the best price for the last 12 months, but the lowest price for the previous three years before that.
NEUT16|So it depends on what your time frame is.
BULL17|I think it's probably a pretty good deal for private equity if they get it.
BULL18|If they get through the Royal Commission unscathed, and if they can get it back to its former glory, it's a pretty good price there.
NEUT19|Planning, I think.
NEUT20|Do you think, though, that the Crown Board will be waiting for better deals?
NEUT21|They'll certainly be shopping this around.
NEUT22|This is this is takeovers 101.
NEUT23|The first thing you do is say you're not going to commit to the first one.
NEUT24|You go and try and find someone else to buy and if you can't you still say no and hope they come back with another 5 or 10% just to sweeten the deal so they'll be a lot more to play out just yet.
NEUT25|They certainly will be rushing to take up this offer off the bat.
NEUT26|What do you make of the timing given the Royal Commission starts on Wednesday?
NEUT27|I think this is a bit of a play by election to.
NEUT28|Basically it's not a get out of jail free card.
BEAR29|There is a sense that this is a bit of a.
NEUT30|Let us take this away for it.
NEUT31|Let's take away the problems you're suffering from and for current shareholders who are saying, well, we don't know what happens next.
NEUT32|We might take this money.
NEUT33|Let's lock this in now we've got the chance.
NEUT34|So I'm very sure that time is not accidental from another bad time to do it.
NEUT35|Of course.
NEUT36|What can shoot?
NEUT37|Well they invested a little bit concerned, given that James Packer owns a third of the company, I'm guessing or assuming that he pretty much holds the controlling, say, right?
NEUT38|What would it take to get Packer over the.
NEUT39|I think he's pretty keen to sell, but he also won't want to offer two cheaper price.
NEUT40|This is the the largest and the trophy asset in the Packer stable right now.
NEUT41|And so to some degree the money that he gets for this asset does determine what the company in the family does next.
NEUT42|Of course, after this I think he wants to sell.
NEUT43|I think he wants out from everything that we know.
NEUT44|As you say, they've already put the company up for sale potential sale in the past.
NEUT45|It's just a question of whether they get enough money.
NEUT46|I think he needs to be seen to be playing coy, but I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to get a deal done.
NEUT47|How significant will this be for James Packer?
NEUT48|Because as you mentioned, this is the jewel in the Crown.
NEUT49|You know he was a big media.
NEUT50|Player he he is a big plan.
NEUT51|Casinos if he leaves casinos, what next?
NEUT52|Fascinating is not.
NEUT53|I mean, this is just something we also the end of the public yo Packer profile that in terms of listed companies going back to.
NEUT54|Of course, PBL, the publishing broadcasting limited way back in the day and everything that's happened to channel line, the media assets run that in the Crown.
NEUT55|As you rightly say, Packers.
NEUT56|Interesting, he's really taken much more private profile over the last five or six years 'cause his own personal struggles as well.
NEUT57|That's been.
BEAR58|It's been a tough journey for him.
NEUT59|I wouldn't be at all surprised if he's happy just to be out of the public eye a little bit more for a little bit longer.
NEUT60|Of course, where that money goes, where it gets invested?
NEUT61|That's a fascinating question.
NEUT62|I don't have an answer really honestly, but I'll be fascinated to see where he decides his value next.
NEUT63|And finally, what do you know about Blackstone?
NEUT64|This private equity company and how does it essentially change other firms?
NEUT65|Rather, casinos were kind of experiences that have yellow black.
NEUT66|I mean the private equity is all about cash flow, right?
NEUT67|That these guys are Masters of cash and with frankly, the money being so cheap, the cost of money close enough to 0 for anyone who cares to dig around.
NEUT68|This is all about the cash flow we should see the usual private equity playbook.
NEUT69|Getting rid of undo.
NEUT70|Undue costs, of course, getting rid of uncertainty around the Royal Commission.
NEUT71|They'll have to wear that, but they're wearing that potentially is a private company.
NEUT72|I imagine we see it.
NEUT73|Live it up with debt and then potentially re floated back onto the market or solder.
BULL74|Would trade buyer in a much better position.
NEUT75|"And of course, after Covid washes through in three or four years time."""
