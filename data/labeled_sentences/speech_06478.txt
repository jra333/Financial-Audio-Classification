NEUT0|"""Hello welcome today's technical analysis for April 3rd, 2018."
NEUT1|I'm Christina, Bethany investment analyst that exam.com and today will be looking at the euro versus the Japanese yen or the daily chart.
BEAR2|Euro Yen relative Stanshall last Monday after touching a seven month low of 128.93 one March 23rd maintaining card.
BEAR3|It's range bound trading started in the beginning of of March, but in the bigger picture we can see that the pair is still bearish.
BEAR4|Considering this steep downfall from 137.49 in early February in the short term, risk is to the downside because Stochastics are running lower and their size now biking bearish territory after it failed to break its neutral threshold of 50.
BEAR5|Moreover, since prices are below the HMO cloud and the written consent line holds below, the Blue King is in line with the market, is more likely to hold this down trend over here.
NEUT6|So I move lower confined.
BULL7|Immediate support at the 130 psychological level.
BEAR8|Then if prices drop below from here, the next target could be the seven month low of 128.93 while even lower.
BEAR9|The market manages to close below.
BULL10|From here, bears actions could increase towards the 128 key level, however the market improves the area around the 23.6% fibo Nachi with outlook from 137.49 to 128.93.
NEUT11|Where are the 20 day moving averages also located?
BULL12|Could provide some resistance.
NEUT13|This is around 130.95, but from here stronger up stuck.
BULL14|Also could come around the 38.2% Fibonacci over 132 point 9090 which has been tested several times, both as resistance support.
NEUT15|Moreover, this is also where the 50 day and the 200 day moving average lines currently are, so it should be an important area to watch before the focus shifts to the 50% people Nachi.
BEAR16|Of 133.29, case prices failed to hold below 132.19.
BEAR17|Now looking at the medium term picture how the pair is already in bearish mode even that prices fluctuate below the 50 day and 200 day moving average lines.
BEAR18|But this bearish situation over here could make things worse because if the 50 day moving average drops below the 200 day moving average positive hopes for the medium term.
NEUT19|Could fade out, so that's all for me.
BULL20|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
