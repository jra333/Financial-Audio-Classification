NEUT0|"""Greg is always got your finger right on on the issue that everybody is kind of trying to wrap their heads around."
NEUT1|I thought Dave service Zarvos put it well yesterday when he said the Fed is getting more power, but it's training.
NEUT2|It's independence.
NEUT3|Yeah, I think that's something that we really have to ask now.
NEUT4|First of all, the Fed is doing what it has to do with any kind of crisis.
NEUT5|Sort of like wartime situation, and the Fed is not going to be doing anybody any favors by sort of like waving the Federal Reserve Act in peoples places and saying no, we can't do that and you gotta give him kudos.
NEUT6|They moved.
NEUT7|Affectively they moved rapidly.
NEUT8|They made decisions that were quite defensible that were not infected by politics.
NEUT9|But let's look a little bit ahead of here Kelly.
NEUT10|They are going to be making decisions with these facilities where they will be lending to municipalities to big companies to small companies.
NEUT11|Which corporate credit are they going to buy?
NEUT12|Which asset backed securities are going to buy?
NEUT13|This is a job that is supposed to be done by private markets.
NEUT14|Who gets the capital?
NEUT15|Who doesn't?
NEUT16|We're going to have unelected technocrats at the Fed doing it.
NEUT17|And here's the issue right now.
NEUT18|That seems like a necessary thing to do.
NEUT19|It's good that they're putting the money out there, but what about when the questions become a little bit more?
NEUT20|Fine grained, you're going to have companies going to their congressmen, saying, hey, we'd like some of that credit, you're gonna have municipalities doing the same thing, and there's going to be pressure on the Fed to be responding, not based on what the data and the financial markets suggests they need to do.
NEUT21|But on the politics suggest they do.
NEUT22|And that's something we need to worry about, right?
NEUT23|And they've also changed their tune on this.
NEUT24|In first it looked like they were going to try to help the strong not help the weak.
NEUT25|Now they're buying junk bond ETF's, you know, the feds not supposed to be picking winners and losers, but in this case it inevitably is like you were just outlining.
NEUT26|Is there and could there have been a different way?
NEUT27|Is there a way they need to massage or think about that communication now?
NEUT28|I mean even just contract ING this stuff out to the likes of Blackrock's as money managers is going to bring up these conflicts of interest, right?
NEUT29|So now the Fed will say that they are not picking individual firms over others.
NEUT30|They are setting broad criteria for classes of borrowers so they'll accept this investment.
NEUT31|This credit rating but not that credit rating and that's all well and good.
NEUT32|And by the way that's more or less as it's basically had been instructed to buy.
NEUT33|The Law of Congress.
NEUT34|So I don't really question their sincerity in this.
NEUT35|But let's face facts is that in designing the facilities and which creature you're going to use, that necessarily excludes some companies and some others.
NEUT36|By deciding that fallen Angels companies that were investment grade up until March 22nd would be eligible.
BULL37|That was essentially turning forward into a winner, even if that wasn't the explicit design.
NEUT38|And I think that so there's that issue, yes, how why do we want the Fed to do that?
NEUT39|There was another way to do it.
NEUT40|We could have just had Congress borrow the $3 trillion and make all those decisions, right?
NEUT41|The economics are exactly the same.
BULL42|I mean, at one level, I suppose it's a good sign that Congress trusts the Fed, probably more than they trust the Trump administration to do this properly.
NEUT43|But there's going to be some tough questions ahead.
NEUT44|Kelly, I mean, you know Jay Powell said that on September 30th will decide if these facilities are still needed.
NEUT45|And I don't doubt that he will apply a very nonpartisan, economically informed view to that.
NEUT46|But Steve Minuchin might have a slightly different view.
NEUT47|You know, he might have an eye on the election and what he wants the shape of the markets to be in.
NEUT48|Those are the kinds of conflicting incentives that the Fed is going to have to negotiate.
NEUT49|Yeah, again, we're just at the beginning.
BULL50|I think of that, Greg, thanks so much.
BULL51|It's a great piece and thanks for joining me today.
BULL52|Really appreciate it.
BULL53|"Thank you, Kelly Gregg."""
