NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, and unfortunately, especially from a technical point of view, I should say because I've talked about this 120 mark quite a bit and overall it was trying its best to get the buns from it late day.
NEUT5|But then now to offer up a little bit of defense here.
BEAR6|The entire markets got crushed.
NEUT7|The last part of the day, so it's not like the markets were booming and going up and up and up.
NEUT8|And then here Apple was going down.
NEUT9|I mean the entire markets did this with the pointer being from the technical point of view that green line has now been broken and that's where the 1st update comes into play in this update is just based on a foundational role in charge in which states when levels of support.
NEUT10|Are broken enclosed below.
NEUT11|They tend to act as resistance, so on any sort of attempted consolidations next week and then movements back to the upside.
NEUT12|The big question Mark now becomes, can the price get back above 120?
NEUT13|So that is definitely the main area of resistance to watch next week, so keep a close eye on that in the near term.
NEUT14|As far as near term areas of resistance are concerned, in the event the price can push up through that, then the next key level of resistance would be not super far away but that purple line right there, which on my chart denotes the very well known.
NEUT15|The very famous 50.
NEUT16|Moving average currently valued at 128.
NEUT17|Nine so you want to watch that also, so keep a close eye there and then.
NEUT18|As far as levels of support of concern.
BULL19|New level to watch.
NEUT20|Now very closely going to be right there at the 118 mark and if 118 cannot quite hold up next level after that that you would definitely want to see the price hold above.
NEUT21|Is that pink line there was on my chart.
NEUT22|Denotes the very well known.
NEUT23|The very famous 200.
NEUT24|Moving average currently valid it.
NEUT25|Let's just call it 117.
NEUT26|So keep trying those levels going forward.
NEUT27|But yeah, very, very brutal.
NEUT28|Close to the day.
NEUT29|And now that it's Friday, you know brutal, close to the week.
NEUT30|But we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around or not.
NEUT31|Next week.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT33|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT38|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT45|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT46|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
