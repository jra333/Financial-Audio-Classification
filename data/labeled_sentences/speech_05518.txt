NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, I'm Forbes Riley and welcome to Forbes living where we make the world your stage."
NEUT1|So there's something special about home cooked sauces and soups and chowders and stews.
NEUT2|No, seriously, I mean I love it.
NEUT3|I love the aromas, the flavors.
NEUT4|Of course, sitting down, enjoying with family and friends, but there's nothing worse than burning them.
NEUT5|Well, my next guest is come up with these amazing solution.
NEUT6|You will never burn your food again because, well, because of Poly cookware.
NEUT7|Please welcome my guest Elizabeth Ann Paul show show.
BULL8|Nice to see you guys on my show.
NEUT9|Now you're married for 28 years were still together.
NEUT10|That's what I'm most impressed.
NEUT11|Alright, so you had a vision because I'm not the first person to do that right?
NEUT12|You burnt the sauce.
BEAR13|I burnt the sawmill quite a few times because like you said, you get preoccupied with something you forgot to start an.
NEUT14|That's at that party.
BEAR15|Sources ruined, right?
NEUT16|So I have a surprise for you.
NEUT17|We're going to reveal in a few minutes, but this sauce and that soup has been cooking all day long and no ones touching.
NEUT18|We open this up is either to be burnt or not.
NEUT19|We're going to see how good public where really is.
NEUT20|OK, so explain to me how you created 'cause this is the inside of your pot.
NEUT21|Yeah, why is your pot different from everyone else's pot?
NEUT22|OK, so this part has a double bottom.
NEUT23|And then there's an oil chamber here.
NEUT24|It's like a pot within a pot.
NEUT25|It's a pot within a pot.
NEUT26|It's a permanent double boiler, so as we heat up the bottom on our cook top, you get hot spots on this bottom, and that transfers heat to the oil, and the oil transfers to heat where your food is evenly.
NEUT27|But you need to start out in the cookware business.
NEUT28|What do you do?
NEUT29|Before this I was a roofing contractor.
NEUT30|OK, how does that become cookware?
NEUT31|I just built one for myself because I was tired of burning my sauce so I knew how to Weld.
NEUT32|'cause I was always well to my equipment and working on things so.
NEUT33|I built one for myself in my shop.
BULL34|Pretty crude, but I brought it home and it worked great.
NEUT35|Tell me why they're so good you put it on the stove and you just walk away and you're not constantly going back every 15 minutes like every other cookware that you know if you don't start, it's going to burn.
NEUT36|I want to see the bottom of the pot.
NEUT37|OK, take that As for that all in there.
NEUT38|Your Italian grandmother is just going.
NEUT39|Oh, I love this.
NEUT40|Can you guys see in the inside?
NEUT41|Wait wait, let me see.
NEUT42|Oh yes you can.
NEUT43|OK, that's crazy that is so remarkable.
NEUT44|Alright, so let me tell me a question for you.
