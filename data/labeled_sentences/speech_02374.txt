BULL0|"""Another solid day on Wall Street gains for all three indices."
BULL1|The Dow finishing up 172 points, closing at 25,000.
BULL2|The S&P 500 up 12 to end at 2737 and the NASDAQ up 54 points, finishing at 7402.
NEUT3|Market analysis.
NEUT4|Now from Chris Keith.
NEUT5|He's with adviser investments in Newton, MA.
NEUT6|Aunties in The Newsroom.
BULL7|Hi Chris, good evening Brian.
NEUT8|OK, So what was moving these numbers today?
NEUT9|Another good day?
NEUT10|Well, you know a lot of the focus today is really on well tonight in the state of the Union address and we were just curious about the tone and what's going to be said there.
NEUT11|But obviously we have to wait a little longer to see that.
NEUT12|But during the point during the day today we had a few other items to focus on.
NEUT13|We had the.
NEUT14|ISM non manufacturing index.
BULL15|We also had a report earning support from Disney and by the end of the day the markets were higher.
BULL16|The S&P advanced by about a half a percent.
BULL17|Investors are riding a five day winning streak and Brian the mood of the market is a lot better than it was just six weeks ago.
NEUT18|Alright, but you did mention the state of the Union speech.
NEUT19|What will investors be looking for tonight?
NEUT20|Well, you know, I think they'll be a little something for everyone here in here, especially the political operatives, right?
NEUT21|But for investors, I think it will be an upbeat speech with a lot of references to the economy.
BULL22|And the strength of the employment markets and the employment picture in the country.
NEUT23|And I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the president bring up some unfinished business.
NEUT24|And by that I mean something.
NEUT25|He talked about a year ago and infrastructure spending plan that went nowhere.
NEUT26|I think Wall Street would like to hear that revisited.
NEUT27|Taxes as well.
NEUT28|Well, you know.
NEUT29|I guess that's a fair expectation.
NEUT30|There's been an awful lot of talk about raising taxes on people of great wealth, and among the bet that the president has a different view, he's going to boast about the strength of the economy and the.
NEUT31|Markets for that matter, and he's going to claim that his tax cuts actually contributed to that, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if he took the opposite side of that argument.
NEUT32|Now, let's talk about reports.
NEUT33|Today we had the non manufacturing sector of the economy reporting in.
BEAR34|Yeah, so the services sector slowed down a little bit last month.
BEAR35|Although it remains in expansionary mode, I think a lot of the weakness or any weakness can be attributed to, well, the government shutdown and the ongoing trade policy debate.
NEUT36|But I think once those distractions are cleared up that the.
BULL37|Index has a chance to rebound and go back to its previous levels and we love to talk about earnings Disney reporting earnings today.
NEUT38|How they do so.
BULL39|Disney came out after the close today and they actually reported a pretty strong quarter.
BULL40|The company earned $1.86 per share versus expectations of $1.54, so that was a pretty good beat right there and a lot of revenue from theme parks really contributed to that.
NEUT41|What I thought was interesting, Brian is to focus for 2019 on something called.
BULL42|Disney Plus, which is their streaming video platform designed to go head to head with Netflix in the battle for subscribers.
NEUT43|I wonder if having Brady and Edelman at Disney World yesterday had anything to do with better earnings?
NEUT44|Probably not.
NEUT45|I'm going to guess probably probably not for this past quarter, but who knows about next quarter?
NEUT46|Well that's you know what we'll have to keep an eye on that?
NEUT47|Alright, what are we looking at for tomorrow?
BULL48|Alright, so no major economic reports tomorrow, but we do get a few more earning supports we hear from Boston Scientific Chipotle and General Motors.
NEUT49|Alright, Chris Keith adviser Investments Newton MA.
BULL50|"Thanks Chris, I thank you, Brian."""
