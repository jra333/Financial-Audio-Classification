NEUT0|"""Neo stock analysis and predictions, December 26th."
NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, two reasons are Apple and NIO collaboration is possible.
NEUT2|All right.
NEUT3|Let's get started.
BULL4|Rumors of a collaboration between an Iowan Apple Inc are gaining momentum.
BEAR5|Since Apple has announced its entry into the electric vehicle sectors, investors and spectators alike have been spinning rumors on the likelihood of Apple and NIO collaboration.
NEUT6|An Apple analyst.
NEUT7|David says says about the possibility of an Iowan Apple collaborating in some fashion.
NEUT8|I have been studying Apple for many years and I always look at the maneuvers Apple makes when they're about to announce some big news.
NEUT9|First, there are speculations and rumors, then Apple will come out with some promotional tool to fuel the rumor.
NEUT10|Then there an announcement date of the final product.
NEUT11|It looks like we are in the first Phase I think the likelihood of an Iowan Apple partnering is not out of the question.
NEUT12|I would give it a 80% chance.
NEUT13|Apples EV ambitions have had many transformations over the last six years.
NEUT14|Apple initially planned to release an electric vehicle in 2006.
NEUT15|It had to significantly scaled down to focus on their other Apple products.
NEUT16|After all, auto production is a large business that requires a lot of upfront capital, Anna.
NEUT17|Team solely focused on that aspect of the business.
NEUT18|We speculate that Apple is trying to play catch up to Tesla with its autonomous driving technology and electric power capabilities.
NEUT19|Thus the relationship with NIO is very sensible due to two factors.
BULL20|One Anio will help Apple catch up to Tesla in electric technology and autonomous features to an IO.
BULL21|Is Tesla strongest competitor when compared to others in the same field?
NEUT22|They always say that the competitor of my competitor is my friend.
NEUT23|According to this, a partnership makes the most sense since Tesla is so far of others in the same sector.
BULL24|Anio is the only company that can possibly overtake or help Apple overtake Tesla's large hold on electric vehicle sector.
BULL25|A collaboration could lay the groundwork for a dual path for Apple and NIO starting to overtake.
NEUT26|Tesla is the most dominate player in the EV sector.
NEUT27|Let's wait and see what happens.
