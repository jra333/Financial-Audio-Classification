NEUT0|"""He goes beyond meat beyond me is so freaking volatile right now, but I always find that once I get really volatile, that's when the opportunity is for people who know what they're doing."
BEAR1|So today, alone opened 233 low 201.
NEUT2|I put the high of the day in this column.
NEUT3|OK, so you can see for instance.
NEUT4|The 1:15 they traded 215.
NEUT5|Why did they trade 2:15 and nothing else traded above well?
NEUT6|Because somebody had an offer in there.
NEUT7|Somebody went to buy what was ever in there and somebody got a really good feel.
BULL8|Good for them.
NEUT9|The trade that I like.
NEUT10|Right now it's 10:00 o'clock in the morning central Time, 11 eastern.
BEAR11|We have about four hours before the close, I think beyond me is going to be extremely volatile all day.
NEUT12|It might trade 2:30 at my trade 200.
NEUT13|It's not going to just sit at 223, so the trades that I like right now, which I think are freaking unbelievable.
NEUT14|Any kind of spreads, so I'd like if you could buy these for $0.40 or $0.45, then chill out.
NEUT15|If the stock goes down at two 15217 then you could start putting on these put spreads for zero or you can literally just go to the market by let's see.
NEUT16|OK, now it's rallying, so that's the time where you want to buy.
NEUT17|So what I like to do is something like this.
NEUT18|40 Cent bid confirm.
NEUT19|By 10 if.
BEAR20|$0.40 but now if I get filled on those, which I assume that I'm going to, then I'm going to ignore it for awhile.
NEUT21|Hopefully it sells back down to two 18217 and then I'm just going to sell something down here.
BEAR22|I'm going to put these trades on for zero all day, and if I don't well then I got $400 of risk on the 100 strike.
NEUT23|They have earnings today again, they went public, $25 very volatile stock, but on the rally I would look to buy puts and put the order in.
NEUT24|Don't just lift, don't just buy the offer work a bit because I'll get filled on these if the stock jumps one more time.
NEUT25|Then the stock sells off.
NEUT26|I'm just waiting for any of these to be 3540 cent fit and then.
NEUT27|20 point vertical and attend lot.
NEUT28|We can make 20 grand and we're risking you know couple $100.
NEUT29|Sign me up.
NEUT30|I want to do that all day today.
NEUT31|Should be a very very good trade and beyond meat I would say be active.
NEUT32|And just pay attention if you're around your computer all day.
NEUT33|This is a very very cool trade.
NEUT34|$0.15 down here if you can get anything for $0.20 then you just sell the $0.15.
BEAR35|OK, as much as it's very, very unlikely for beyond meet the trade under 100 today.
NEUT36|Crazy **** happens.
NEUT37|I can tell you this, you rather belong these than selling these, that's for sure.
BULL38|OK, hope it helps.
NEUT39|That's what I'm doing.
NEUT40|You could see game real active down here.
NEUT41|I think we're going to Bunny.
BULL42|Hope it helps.
NEUT43|"Jonathan Masters in trading."""
