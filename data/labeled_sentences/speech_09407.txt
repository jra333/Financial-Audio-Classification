BULL0|"""David, it was interesting."
NEUT1|I'm not sure if you heard Teresa Cons views earlier.
NEUT2|Basically, she said you know it doesn't necessarily signal impending disaster that Evergrande needs to decide what it wants to be when it grows up.
NEUT3|Let me get your views.
NEUT4|How serious is this situation?
BEAR5|Well, so the situation now and the reason markets reacted quite badly on Thursday, you know with the stock is down 6% the most since may or or the lowest level since May is that you know we were able to see a letter.
NEUT6|It was dated August 24th about a month ago and the letter was from the company that sent it to the Guangdong government and essentially it was outlining a worst sort of a worst case scenario in mapping out what kind of situation that was.
NEUT7|So I guess that's the first point.
BULL8|There was an incentive here.
BULL9|From the company to obviously paint a fairly bleak picture in order for it to get what it wants, which is really support for a restructuring.
NEUT10|So what's going to happen is there's a deadline January 31st.
NEUT11|That's when strategic investors are allowed to exit.
BULL12|Now the if it does get the restructuring and part of that might lead to it being able to list it, then averts a cash crunch.
BEAR13|If it doesn't happen, it might be facing $19 billion.
NEUT14|That's a payment.
NEUT15|It needs to make to those investors.
NEUT16|And that's about 90% of its cash.
NEUT17|That's going to.
BEAR18|That's really going to dry up its balance sheet.
NEUT19|Now.
NEUT20|The reason we're looking at this is because it's a very big developer.
BEAR21|An obviously when you look at the reaction in the bond markets and here you go with the drop in and spots.
NEUT22|Yesterday it's something to consider because this might be.
BEAR23|A similar situation which some not all developers might find themselves in SNP yesterday, revised its outlook to negative for the for the company's rating, so we'll see what happens today, here, so the signs pointing to a systemic disaster here.
NEUT24|What are the possible wider implications?
BEAR25|Part of the letter, Sherry did talk about that, so if it does get to this situation where it needs to pay a certain amount of money, say a large amount of money that could lead to an.
NEUT26|I'm going to look at the paper here.
NEUT27|Cross defaults.
NEUT28|That's the term that they used here in its borrowing from banks trusts, and this is where it goes from an issue specific to ever grad.
NEUT29|You have a deadline of investors to pay, you need to pay it by this time to something that might have wider implications on the industry.
NEUT30|What you're looking at on your screens.
NEUT31|You're looking at dollar issuance bond issuance in China.
BEAR32|Already quite low.
NEUT33|When you say debts when you say Chinese debt issues usually first thing that comes to mind is property developers.
NEUT34|That's where you get a lot of the fund raising a lot of the leverage.
NEUT35|A lot of you know, net gearing on those balance sheets.
NEUT36|Specific to the industry, is it a big issue?
NEUT37|It hasn't been an issue.
NEUT38|Will this trigger something it could, which is why we're tracking not just what happens with Evergrande today.
NEUT39|Things like wider spreads, for example an.
NEUT40|It's certainly if you're sitting on debts.
NEUT41|If you're sitting in bonds or Chinese developers.
NEUT42|"This news is what you do not need in your life."""
