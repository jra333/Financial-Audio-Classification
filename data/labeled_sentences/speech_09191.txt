NEUT0|"""BK Tim Draper seems kind of crazy when he's saying $250,000 by 2022."
NEUT1|It you know what?
NEUT2|It sounds crazy, but think about it this way, that's four years from now.
BEAR3|That's a 3000% return from here, which again sounds crazy.
BULL4|But over the last two years, Bitcoins had a 4000% return.
NEUT5|So now again it parabolic.
NEUT6|But it would just be a continuation of the trend that we've seen as Bitcoin moves to become more institutionalized.
NEUT7|Though in terms of investor flows, would we see those kinds of parabolic moves?
NEUT8|Or does the training get sort of dampen the volatility get dampened?
NEUT9|Well, well, the hope is the volatility gets dampened and and that way it becomes a lot more usable 'cause the big problem with Bitcoin now is, you know using it as a currency is very difficult because of the volatility.
NEUT10|Use it in the countries that Mark Mobius was talking about because you don't have an alternative.
NEUT11|This is what you have to use, but we'd certainly like to see with futures.
BULL12|You know, this week we had big volume in futures that'll hopefully tamp down the volatility a bit.
NEUT13|That doesn't mean we can't, it can't reach those levels, it just might not do it as fast it did in the last two years.
NEUT14|It might take four years like Tim Draper say.
NEUT15|What's your own forecast peaks?
BULL16|Oh, that's my own forecast, Allison, I think you know we can get transaction volumes up again then there's no reason why this couldn't be at 2025 thousand by the end of the year.
BULL17|Again, we can make a new high.
NEUT18|And in terms of next week, this week was a very, very big week.
NEUT19|What are you watching for next week in terms of whether or not we so you heard a guys, Brian Kelly?
NEUT20|Mainstream media saying Bitcoin is going to the moon Bitcoin to 25,000 so?
NEUT21|We'll see if they're right.
BULL22|We definitely had a nice little price runup.
NEUT23|What's interesting is less than an hour before I decided to go to Coachella this year.
BEAR24|The price shot up so I don't know if that's a good omen or what, but my personal opinion is you gotta be careful with cryptocurrency.
NEUT25|It's very, very volatile.
NEUT26|That's why I don't think it's a good idea to be making large transactions.
NEUT27|Instead, you want to kind of spread it around and dollar cost average.
NEUT28|You still have to wait for the regulation.
NEUT29|So what I'm really waiting for where I would think we hit that 25,000 price target is that there's an actual ETF that's released and I believe this doesn't have to be just the United States.
BULL30|I believe in other markets as well, they're going to that route where you can use institutional ways to buy crypto, so if that trend comes around, I think that will really help get us to 25,000.
BULL31|And if you've been watching this show, I've made the prediction that we would hit a $1 trillion market cap, which is almost three times with the current prices.
BULL32|So I do think, well, we will hit that price level.
NEUT33|Maybe by the end of the year right away.
NEUT34|I don't think so.
NEUT35|I think there's still a lot of regulations that need to be discovered and fixed, and I wouldn't be surprised if it takes over a year, but I think the one year mark or now it's less than a year, but.
NEUT36|Basically, with six months yeah 66 to 8 months is.
BULL37|Adam optimistic, I still think yeah, we're probably closer away to maybe even pass the 2018 maybe sometime in 2019.
NEUT38|We hit that, but you never know with crypto currencies, so it's really interesting and let me know what you guys think.
BULL39|Would love to hear your comments on this and we're getting very very close to 8000 subscribers.
BULL40|So once again, thank you for your support.
BULL41|Thank you for your comments and I will continue to try to bring a good news to you guys so.
NEUT42|"Let me know how you guys feel and thank you very much for watching and I will talk to you guys soon."""
