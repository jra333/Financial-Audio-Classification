NEUT0|"""Well, what we've done here on this really embrace this kind of reflationary trade that's been going on since November."
NEUT1|Obviously, the 10 year note at the push and pull between the 10 year note the NASDAQ is is something to to make mention of and and obviously follow very closely, but I think for us it's it's making sure you have a balanced approach here.
NEUT2|Even kill between value in an growth, and I think that's going to be important as we move forward and kind of see how the market trend from over the next few quarters.
NEUT3|Mike oil prices.
BEAR4|Noticeable pull back for the week is a whole little bit of a jump today.
NEUT5|Is that something that could start to take the wind out of a sector?
BULL6|That of course has been incredibly strong so far this year.
BULL7|Yeah, it's been an excuse to.
NEUT8|I think you know skim a little bit of sort of momentum gains out of out of energy, but it's interesting though because it was pretty much a neglected.
NEUT9|Just cast aside group several months ago and then with this revival when you see people getting the more excited about the demand picture and maybe we're not going to see a similar supply response this time because of long term secular issues.
NEUT10|I think people did kind of make up rationales for why there was a lot more to go, and one of those would be if you looked at a 10 year chart of energy versus the S&P, because it is.
BEAR11|It looks like it's just barely even budged, even though it's up vastly for the last several months.
BULL12|So to me, it's it definitely requires some kind of consolidation, and $60.00 was a pretty significant area to get above and see if it can can hang above there for a little while longer.
NEUT13|Let's hit Tesla Wilford.
BEAR14|You mentioned it under pressure again today, after reports that the Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by state and military personnel citing national security concerns.
BEAR15|China's alleged growing distrust of Tesla comes as America's auto safety agency ratchets up investigations into Tesla.
BEAR16|The agency disclosed that it currently has 23 active investigations into recent Tesla vehicle crashes and competition and the electric vehicle market overall continues to heat up.
BULL17|Barclays upgrading shares of Ford to overweight.
BULL18|Predicting the company will likely aggressively shift its strategy towards battery electric vehicles in the coming years.
BULL19|That's really helped.
NEUT20|Ford and GM Jason.
NEUT21|How do you play this theme?
NEUT22|Man?
NEUT23|It's Tesla.
NEUT24|Risky from here.
NEUT25|So it's a great question.
NEUT26|I think Tesla for us has been a trade.
NEUT27|We've been trading in and out of it over the last 18 months.
NEUT28|I like I like this, move it forward.
NEUT29|I like this move.
NEUT30|You know, I've I've like GM.
NEUT31|We've kind of played the do-it-yourself market.
NEUT32|You know it AutoZone, which we actually moved out of recently.
NEUT33|But what I will say, I like the alliance with Ford and VW.
BULL34|I think I think the increasing competition is a good thing, you know.
BULL35|And I think there's obviously a lot of upward trend and movement here.
BULL36|And I think it's an opportunity to jump in and be a part of it.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT38|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
