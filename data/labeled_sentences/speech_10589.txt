NEUT0|"""The market was closed on Election Day that changed in 1984, so today with it open, what's the market telling us?"
NEUT1|Who better than Jim Cramer?
NEUT2|To find out from that?
NEUT3|Jim, I heard you say yesterday and again today.
NEUT4|This was a Biden rally.
NEUT5|Why do you say that?
NEUT6|And what does that mean?
NEUT7|Well I mean I think that people just want to get this thing over with.
NEUT8|I think people there a lot of people on Wall Street that want Biden.
NEUT9|They just don't want anymore what they would regard as being let's say excitement.
BEAR10|They like boring and I think that there were a lot of people at the last minute.
NEUT11|Kind of felt you know what?
NEUT12|This thing is going to end up being something goes Biden's way, and it'll be clearly Biden's way.
NEUT13|Now that is not to say the way I feel because after 2016 ship, I gotta tell you, I know better than to say this way is going to do this or that.
BULL14|But I think having it over is causing a very nice move today.
BULL15|Well, we're hopeful that it's over at least right.
NEUT16|Does the market care which of them and if so, why?
NEUT17|Well, look, the market loves the brakes that Biden would give to the international companies to pay what they would do with China, because even though he's a Hawk on China.
NEUT18|He's a softalk versus the current president, but the people love low taxes and they want to put money in the market and the corporations love taxes and that's that's Trump's bailiwick.
NEUT19|So they take the too much excitement.
NEUT20|But they like to have low taxes.
NEUT21|If you knew the results right now.
NEUT22|The market react.
BULL23|I think that that we have had a very big rally in anticipation of something good occur.
NEUT24|I think you'd get a get a quick dip no matter who wins, but you gotta buy ahead of this because I'm telling you once this election is all the way, it really doesn't matter.
BULL25|We're going to be in good shape and I feel strongly economy is getting better.
NEUT26|And I do think, well, vaccine the first quarter.
NEUT27|That's what matters.
NEUT28|Jim Cramer mad money.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
