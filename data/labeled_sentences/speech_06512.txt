NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to these technical analysis video here the exam.com."
NEUT1|It's a Monday, August 6th and today we're going to look at Pound Dollar's.
BEAR2|Surprisingly, all members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee decided to high grades for the second time since financial crisis last week, but the Bank of England chief Mark Carney Bird fresh downside to pound dollar, saying that chances for no Brexit deal are uncomfortably high.
NEUT3|Also now presuming to the daily chart, we can see that.
BEAR4|Pound dollar continues to trade in a downtrend posting, another lower high at on July 26th.
BEAR5|At one point, 3212, before it fell marginally below 1.30 negative momentum.
BEAR6|However, he is more likely to stay in the short term because if we look at the Mac the the index has reversed back to the downside to break slightly below the red signal line in negative territory.
BEAR7|While we're excited up here has also lost strength deviating further below 50.
NEUT8|A signal that the next moving prices.
NEUT9|Is more likely to be down a thoughtful look at this stochastics down.
BEAR10|Here how those suggests that the price could be oversold as the lines are close to post the bullish cross below 20, so upside corrections cannot be excluded either for now.
NEUT11|Now if we see further weakness in the market that the price could find immediate support at one point 29 the frequently tested area back in 2017 Earth lower than that the next step could be around one point 2770 where the price font support.
NEUT12|And resistance in the past, so it should be in focus, while if this proves to be a weak obstacle as well, then attention could turn down to 1.26.
BULL13|However, if pound dollar managers to rebound above 1.30, the area between the 20 day in the 50 day moving average lines, this is between one point 3122 and one point 3209 could provide some resistance as it did in the past couple of weeks before we see retest of the July 7th peak of one point.
BEAR14|3471 higher than that, and especially above 1.36, we would have a clear violation of this downward pattern and therefore, in confirmation that stronger bullish actions could follow up.
BEAR15|Finally, looking at the medium term picture, the outlook here remains bearish.
BEAR16|Given this steep downfall as well as this bearish cross between the 50 and the 200 day moving average lines.
NEUT17|So unless we see a break above 1.36, the market will probably continue to trade bearish in the medium term, so that's all from me.
BULL18|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
