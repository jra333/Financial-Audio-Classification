NEUT0|"""Hi everyone in this video a very quick update on Alibaba stock and let's get started."
BEAR1|So basically the last day it was almost 1% negative so zero point, 80% negative pre market is negative 0.0483 so nothing special an as you can see the last few days it just went up a lot.
BULL2|So 9% in general.
NEUT3|And basically if you've seen other of my videos you know that Alibaba is one of my favorite stocks to hold.
BEAR4|So they had two massive dips because of end financials.
BEAR5|And because of the Chinese government and pretty much eat plummeted 20% and right now it went up 9%.
BULL6|So it can still go up 10%.
NEUT7|And aside from that you can still reach all time highs, which is very likely to happen.
BULL8|And this is one of the best opportunities in the stock market right now.
NEUT9|Definitely one of the top five or maybe Top 10 best stocks to buy at this moment.
BULL10|Right now this company I still think is relatively undervalued and if you want to make a quick 10% profit with this one, go ahead.
BULL11|If you want to make a 50% profit with 5X leverage, it's more risky, but go ahead if you want to and pretty much I'm sure that they will reach all time highs and I think they will reach 350 probably before they have a massive dip again.
BULL12|So definitely if you want to make a 10 to 20% profit in one month, I think this is a great option.
NEUT13|So for most people personally I don't recommend an SP500.
NEUT14|I recommend building your own portfolio with for example 5 stocks so for example.
NEUT15|A very nice portfolio would be Neo stock volunteer stock, Alibaba stock, Tesla stock and also a couple of others, so that would be a pretty nice portfolio.
NEUT16|And definitely Alibaba is for me personally pretty much a must to have in a great portfolio because this is an E Commerce giant that will probably still grow a ton in the next couple of years an like I said one of the best stocks to buy an if you're a long term investor.
NEUT17|This is a gold mine.
NEUT18|And if you are a short term investor, I definitely don't recommend this one.
BEAR19|This is not very volatile, as you can see in one day it goes down pretty much 1%.
BULL20|An goes up 1% to percent 3%.
BEAR21|It doesn't really move that much because it has a ton of shares floating around, which is great for stability and pretty much for long term investors, but it's pretty bad if you are the trailer.
NEUT22|So if you are a short term investor, I definitely don't recommend Alibaba stock.
NEUT23|You are not going to make that much money with this one, but if you are a medium to long term investor and you want to invest for at least one to two months and at Max 5 to 10 years, this is an amazing buying opportunity.
BULL24|And I definitely think is going to grow a lot.
NEUT25|In the next couple of years.
BULL26|So in conclusion, Ali Baba stock is definitely one of the best stocks that you can buy right now.
NEUT27|For medium to long term investors, meaning you want to sell in a few months or in a few years.
NEUT28|So for most people, this is definitely a stock that I massively recommend, and I think you can make very good amounts of profit with this one long term, so that was it for this video.
BULL29|Thank you guys so much for watching.
