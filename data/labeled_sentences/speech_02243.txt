NEUT0|"""Welcome back is 1/3 of September 2020."
NEUT1|Thursday, the 4th day after week we are at #11 crypto.com, coin CR.
BULL2|Oh so for CR against BC Superweek towards the top.
BEAR3|And every drop back down right now, nothing much is happening BC there was a pull down for BDC but it did not affect crypto.com coin that much.
NEUT4|This is just nothing that significant for crypto coin.
BEAR5|Sure we may drop down but this looks to me like a very.
NEUT6|You know critical playing still very strong right?
NEUT7|At this point of time.
NEUT8|If we start forming Squeeze, chop it down over here, then adding cryptocoin could still go higher and higher, right?
NEUT9|We do not know exactly how much higher is going to go far, but it would be great if you could correct a little bit longer first before making any moves towards the upside.
BULL10|But it is still looking very strong at this point of time.
NEUT11|Of course, if you start forming mountain ranges or some sort of a descending triangle, then of course we're going to be dropping lower from here, but until that happens we will remain patient and we will wait for the cryptocoin wheels to do the acting is that things are still looking very strong for crypto.com coin go so you don't have any targets.
NEUT12|No downside targets.
NEUT13|No upside targets, so we're still not exactly sure what's happening.
NEUT14|This feels to me like a consolidation.
NEUT15|We don't know.
NEUT16|This is going to consolidate to be bullish or going to be bearish, so we're giving the wheels of crypto.com coin more time to do their thing.
NEUT17|And of course, if things start turning bullish will probably be.
NEUT18|I don't know, we might take trades for it, but until that happens here, we're going to be rushing into anything.
NEUT19|Alright, so as we want to see our against USD T, But before that, please give this video a like you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel.
NEUT20|And let me know what you think about CRO in the comments below for Sierra against USD T there are lots of we keep rising higher and higher and higher and higher and higher.
BEAR21|But you can see that the strength has been decreasing strength.
BEAR22|Look at the RSI keep forming lower highs, lower highs, lower highs on the RSI as well.
BULL23|Lower high.
BULL24|But we keep forming higher high and higher high.
NEUT25|So this is really I mean this move is really a triple bearish divergent, which means that by right we should be reversing back down.
NEUT26|But we don't see it yet.
NEUT27|I don't see the reversal yet, but you never know, right?
BEAR28|Are things might just start collapsing just like that.
NEUT29|It's just at this point of time we still don't see any bearishness yet.
BEAR30|All we know is that there is a loss of strength with significant loss of strength coming in on the main DN RSI.
NEUT31|So be very, very careful about entering now.
NEUT32|Hoping for things to go higher, right?
NEUT33|You're going to make an entry you should be making entry at the very bottom, not at top near.
NEUT34|This is where things are over.
NEUT35|Overbought super over Bazza is actually selling season not buying season four crypto.com alright so I guess I see from my in crypto.com technical analysis.
BULL36|"Thank you very much for watching, I hope you enjoyed it, I just see you in the next video."""
