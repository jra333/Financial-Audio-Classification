BULL0|"""Everybody, thanks for watching this video on Apple stock."
NEUT1|Let's see if we can predict the next step of Apple just using very simple technical analysis tools in front of us.
NEUT2|There is one hour candle stick and with blue line already drawn, the major trend and with just simple target and residence price levels and perhaps some trendlines, let's see what we can say about.
NEUT3|In these stock.
NEUT4|So first of all, it's easy to understand.
NEUT5|Hopefully it's easy to understand that there's been moving in a bullish trend just using another simple tools that really I like it is one of the most trustworthy tools in technical analysis, and it is the X or moving average.
BULL6|The simple moving average or the exponential moving average it has been working very well.
NEUT7|It is a complaining.
BULL8|The this bullish trend and actually work very well as support for this new rarely accept this point where something was going on with breakout at this point, like a weakness signal, but actually there was a jump with the gap.
NEUT9|You know, in the oh, actually we know the signal was just if I say fake signal or false alarm.
NEUT10|But anyway the prices went up but this one just went of this.
NEUT11|This moving average just full of these.
NEUT12|Uptrend and again the break out of this element now is just showing a little bit of weakness of these of these market right now as we are right now just using this simple moving average move we can see movie can say is that we are generally when we are above.
NEUT13|It's like working a little bit like like other side when you are above this level the idea is to go to cool off.
NEUT14|When you are short, is that yet to go short?
NEUT15|But generally this is not not always like that.
NEUT16|Of course it's not so easy and straightforward, but we can say then that is actually where we are in now.
NEUT17|It worked probably seems that as well it worked as support for a new rail, so it seems that we are ready to see and you rarely right now.
NEUT18|And of course we would like to invite to go longer rather than go short, so the idea is not to go short.
NEUT19|Enough for becauses the major trend is a bullish trend.
NEUT20|So we would like to follow the major trends so we have in front of us is prices going up, opposing a little bit.
NEUT21|Hopefully they're gonna resume their their previous trend soon just after Christmas perhaps.
BULL22|But with this target price of approximately 140 U.S. dollars, with my technical analysis we are actually 135 U.S. dollar thinking and go up to 140.
NEUT23|But let's see.
NEUT24|Now its target price, first target price 135 U.S. dollar.
NEUT25|The idea is that if in the next days the daily close the daily close price of Apple is going to be a bulb 125 U.S. dollar idea is to go long at least for two or three days in a row.
NEUT26|The prices have to close above 125 U.S. dollar.
NEUT27|The idea is to go longer target price one 135 U.S. dollars always.
NEUT28|Please bear in mind.
NEUT29|To read a lot of news around Apple in title match, always Apple with technical technical analysis with fundamental analysis.
NEUT30|Always there should be on the same page.
NEUT31|So this is my interpretation of Apple stock high hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT32|"Thanks bye."""
