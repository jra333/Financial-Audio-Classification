BULL0|"""GameStop is up 92% and you want you over here."
NEUT1|Wondering what the hell is going on.
NEUT2|OK, so for all of this looks like it's going to be $32.
NEUT3|$32.
BEAR4|$32 Oh my bad and $0.17.
NEUT5|So guys just do me a quick favor and subscribe to my YouTube channel.
NEUT6|Turn on the notification button and like comment and share.
NEUT7|So GameStop does 92% on Monday, does another 92% on a Tuesday and people are wondering what the hell is going on?
NEUT8|Well, it's because of these guys, the wallstreetbets Reddit group that pumped up the stock because they didn't like what hedge funds were doing an it's versus these guys, a company called Melvin Capital Management and they shorted the stock extremely and he said retail investors had no power and they had all the power.
NEUT9|So who are wallstreetbets Wilder Reddit group?
NEUT10|But about 2.6 million members and a regular retail investors just like you and me.
NEUT11|So it's open group and anyone can join and what they've been doing is they've been popping a lot of stocks, one including BlackBerry, Nokia and of course, GameStop.
NEUT12|Wallstreetbets also has support from Elon Musk, Chaumont, Chantel Jeffries, and many other celebrities and public figures and just goes to show you how much power.
BEAR13|The retailers have and we don't need these hedge funds and these hedge funds are shaking right now.
NEUT14|They're ******** bricks because they realize that they are not the only ones that can manipulate the market.
NEUT15|See when these big time guys or hedge funds manipulate the market.
NEUT16|It's not illegal, but all of sudden retail investors do it.
BEAR17|It's completely wrong and they want to shut us down.
BULL18|In the end, it's good to see that a lot of people are awoke to some of the schemes these guys are pulling, and now they realize that we have the power to do the same.
NEUT19|And it's only fair.
NEUT20|Why should these guys get away with it while we take loss and lose while they win?
NEUT21|No, now the tables have turned we're winning and they're losing and we don't need these guys to help us invest.
NEUT22|We don't need to pay their stupid fees.
NEUT23|We can clearly do it all on our own, specially if you use Wealthsimple trade or free trading platform.
NEUT24|Let these guys suffer and let us win.
NEUT25|Although if you ask me if I would buy a game stock right now, I probably wouldn't just because of the risk factors.
NEUT26|I mean you're buying another super all time high, specially when it's being pumped.
NEUT27|And any time he's got, especially Wall Street guys, they could take their profits and leave.
NEUT28|So you can't really trust anyone.
NEUT29|Even if these guys are rooting for for us the retail investors.
NEUT30|But my question is, what's the next stock that's going to blow up that stock is AMC my friend?
NEUT31|That's right, this movie theater company and it's already $8.00 in the aftermarket.
NEUT32|If you go on social media, you're going to see that EMC is being pumped and being talked about, especially by the Wall Street bank accounts.
NEUT33|Anyone that's in wallstreetbets?
NEUT34|It's anticipated to touch almost 20 to 40, or who knows, maybe can we touch 100, but that's the next stop.
NEUT35|That's the next talk to play if you're especially if you're looking for something like GameStop, and I would, I would rather go into Amcy then GameStop.
NEUT36|A lot of these guys, especially on Wall Street, better super hopeful, and speculating that GameStop will be $1000 plus.
NEUT37|And you know what?
NEUT38|I'm all with it.
NEUT39|I'm all for it, but sometimes you just gotta look at the risk factors.
NEUT40|"And MC is much cheaper and it's already blowing up in the aftermarket, so why not take a chance?"""
