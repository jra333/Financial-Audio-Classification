NEUT0|"""As we look at the SMP right now, hovering around 1900 Mark, where do you see it say by December of this year?"
NEUT1|Personally, I December I don't know, but I think between now and the year end.
BEAR2|The market will drop something like another 10% or even 20%.
BULL3|I think we can have a big sell off.
NEUT4|In the fall.
NEUT5|So a big sell off coming this fall.
BEAR6|You're predicting a loss of 10 to 20%, a pretty significant correction.
NEUT7|Then mark.
BEAR8|Well, a lot of stocks are down 1020% already, so I can't market value market.
NEUT9|Mark overall market.
BEAR10|So the S&P you think it could be down 10 to 20%.
NEUT11|Let's put it this way.
BEAR12|I think the SNP will close down on the year.
NEUT13|And I think that the bull market.
NEUT14|He's more than five years old by any standard.
NEUT15|This is a very old bull market.
NEUT16|It began in March 2009.
NEUT17|We're now August 2014.
NEUT18|The economic recovery became began in June 2009, were now August 2014.
BEAR19|He's also by any standard, a lengthy economic recovery, a weak recovery.
NEUT20|Largely courtesy of the Fed.
BEAR21|By printing money they have actually delayed the cleaning process, but I believe that asset prices are unattractive.
NEUT22|Also, some shares I hold some bombs, I old some gold and gold shares.
NEUT23|"I own some real Estates, but I don't believe that the returns will be very high."""
