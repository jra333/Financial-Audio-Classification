BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel."
NEUT1|Actively passive income.
NEUT2|In today's video I'm going to be going over expert.
NEUT3|Today is December 9 and the markets actually still open.
NEUT4|I'm going to go over some key resistance and support lines.
NEUT5|Possible pattern of head and shoulders and also what to watch out for in the next few days.
NEUT6|So let's get started.
NEUT7|Let's start with the daily chart.
NEUT8|As you can see here that.
BEAR9|I was monitoring the downward trend line yesterday.
BEAR10|There was a jump slightly over the line which could have indicated a trend reversal, specially that it went also above the 20 email line.
NEUT11|But today that didn't hold as you see here.
BEAR12|It kept continuing the downward trend line.
BEAR13|In fact, if you look at the Mac D and the RSI, they're both still trending downwards.
BEAR14|Keep in mind the market is still open and we're actually right now at almost 8% drop at 44.88.
NEUT15|One thing they want to keep an eye on in terms of a major support line.
NEUT16|Is this region here?
NEUT17|When I keep an eye on it, which is basically around the 3994 and the 50 MA line.
NEUT18|So it has to hold here.
NEUT19|Otherwise if it does break, then we're looking at the retest of the 3051 support line, which is a major support line.
NEUT20|As you can see here.
NEUT21|So tomorrow.
BULL22|Maximum after tomorrow we should be reaching towards that region if it's going to get retested.
NEUT23|Turn to the hourly chart.
BEAR24|We could see here that in fact, around half an hour ago there was a major drop in all of the stocks, not just TV stocks, but even tech stocks.
BEAR25|For a few minutes, I checked the news, there was no news that could have caused it.
NEUT26|But I'll check again and see if there's anything I might have missed.
BULL27|As you see here, it broke the 200 MA line.
NEUT28|But then it bounced right back up that and now it's still holding steadily around that point.
BULL29|So we'll see if it's going to hold today above the 200 day may line, which could be promising.
NEUT30|Otherwise, if that breaks, then we're looking about the around the region that I mentioned earlier.
NEUT31|I'm going to keep an eye on this and I'll post an updated video tomorrow or after tomorrow.
NEUT32|If there's any major update to what I said today.
NEUT33|"Thank you all for watching and see in the next video."""
