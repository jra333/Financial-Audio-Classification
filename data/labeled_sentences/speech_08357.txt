BULL0|"""Hello, I'm John Roos here with Dave Myer and tell you we're going to talk about Tesla so Tesla has been one of the most remarkable investing stories of the year so far."
NEUT1|The stock is on fire and the business is transforming the automotive industry, so Dave, I know you and I both are big fans of Peter.
NEUT2|Yes, right?
NEUT3|So I thought just for fun.
NEUT4|Would Peter Lynch by Tesla right now at these prices?
NEUT5|That's a great question.
NEUT6|I think we can look at three of his little sayings and try to get some glean some information about that and the first one is.
NEUT7|Growth stocks never look cheap.
NEUT8|You know, when we use traditional metrics for companies like Walmart or Amazon when they first start out, value investors just aren't going to buy them that buy shares of those types of companies at that time.
NEUT9|You know, looking at Tesla, it doesn't look cheap, but man, it is an incredible business that's doing some incredible things in a stodgy industry.
NEUT10|The other thing is, add winners and cut your losers.
NEUT11|So that's a big Peter Lynch thing.
NEUT12|You know, it's hard for investors to do that, including me.
NEUT13|We're at the opposite, exactly.
BULL14|We think cheaper is better as opposed to more expensive and winners are like time to get out exactly so 10.
NEUT15|What tends to happen is we cut the winner an add money to the loser.
BULL16|But I'm actually thinking in reverse Now Tile Shop Holdings is a company that's growing, and that's a high quality company I've been adding to it as the share price has been going up.
BULL17|I think people who have done that for Tesla have also been rewarded recently, So what about selling?
NEUT18|I mean, I know Peter Lynch talks about selling it, you know, is there a time with Tesla that you're like?
NEUT19|OK, yeah, he actually had some very specific things about selling growth stocks and what he wanted to do was he wanted to look at the second phase of growth and see just how good that was.
BEAR20|If that started to dwindle then investors should watch out because the multiples that investors were willing to in pay pay would contract.
NEUT21|However, Tesla is not even.
NEUT22|Entered its second phase of growth, yet that will come with the Model X and the car that they want to produce for the masses, so I don't think that's something we need to worry about today.
NEUT23|Not to be too critical, but didn't Peter Lynch like sleepy Underfollowed boring businesses?
NEUT24|And wasn't valuation importantly, what?
NEUT25|Yeah, yeah, the answer is yes to both of them, but if you look at his portfolio he loved all sorts of situations and I wouldn't have been surprised if he would have picked up some.
NEUT26|A little few shares of Tesla.
NEUT27|Early on in its life, so the question is, would he be selling those today?
NEUT28|I don't think so.
NEUT29|I think if we look at the what's what's Tesla has in front of it in terms of its second phase of growth, I think he would be holding on.
NEUT30|So would it be fair to say probably wouldn't be buying at today's prices, but he wouldn't be selling out?
BULL31|I think that's the perfect way to sum it up, excellent.
NEUT32|Well, thank you you're welcome and be sure to follow Tesla on full.com.
BULL33|"Thank you."""
