BULL0|"""Do you think GEICO will experience unusually high profitability in 2020 due to the reduced amount of driving even after giving customers a 15% credit?"

BULL2|Customers at GEICO, with the second largest auto insurance company and and different auto insurers are handling.
NEUT3|A sharing of the of the better experience with their policy holders in different ways we.
NEUT4|Our plan.
NEUT5|Will deliver back 2 1/2 billion roughly or so and in recognizing.
BULL6|Has the reduced frequency of accidents during this.
NEUT7|What we don't know is how long.
NEUT8|This will continue.
BEAR9|I mean, people want to drive their cars still, but conditions have reduced that driving dramatically, obviously now.
NEUT10|We have instituted a program that runs saving people money.
NEUT11|For six months and and and so far, other people largely been two months, but some of them that's given a little more for those two months.
NEUT12|And then we get per month.
BULL13|Our total is the greatest.

BEAR30|Another in our premiums that we receive really over.
NEUT31|The next year applies for a six month on renewals, but that will be renewing policies in October that will extend it then.
