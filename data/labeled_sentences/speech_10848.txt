NEUT0|"""If you're wondering what happened to MFA, I'm going to break it all down for him."
NEUT1|Explain to you why did it crash, what's next?
NEUT2|Where is it going?
NEUT3|Follow along.
NEUT4|Welcome to The Newsroom.
NEUT5|Alright, so today I'm talking about MFA.
NEUT6|Why did MFA crash if you bought it?
NEUT7|You wondering, should I hold in my bag Holder is a long term as a short term.
NEUT8|What do I do?
NEUT9|Let me break it all down for you.
NEUT10|I have MFA up here.
NEUT11|What happened?
NEUT12|I'm gonna tell you exactly what happened?
NEUT13|Stocks moving waves right?
NEUT14|They move like this.
NEUT15|They don't just go up, up, up, up, up, up, forever and you gotta be the one smart enough to get out before that wave crashes on you.
NEUT16|If we look at MFA in the beginning after it.
NEUT17|At its bottom from the Rona, it hit 34 hit 102 hit 150 in these three green boxes.
NEUT18|It leveled up progressively each time, but in between that it did this.
NEUT19|It did this.
NEUT20|It did this alright, so looking at current times though, MFA moves in levels and so does every other stock and you have to be aware of that.
NEUT21|You need to be aware of the way stocks move.
NEUT22|You have to look at them from a distance, not just a one day or a five day chart.
NEUT23|Look at them.
NEUT24|Long term and figure out what's going on and why it's moving the way it does.
NEUT25|I drew this little line to show you kind of the direction.
BULL26|I think it's going to go.
NEUT27|It's going to go back.
BULL28|It's going to test that $3 range if the market continues to be bullish and I could see MFA testing 350 again.
NEUT29|Four dollars, $5 all the way up to its main test at 4:50.
NEUT30|I've talked about this in my other videos I've talked about fuc times the ultimate price target of $8.00, so that's Murphy's average.
NEUT31|But of course, that's the correlate to the current economic times.
NEUT32|What's going on with the markets currently at all?
NEUT33|As to make sense, but $8.00 is MFA's average value pre Rona.
NEUT34|Alright so I drew this steel line to show you that this is still hanging on to that.
NEUT35|That nice you formation which I love and I will keep trading MFA until it breaks that you formation and it will break that you formation if it fell out of it, which would most likely be below $2.00 and I wouldn't like it at that point 'cause then it's falling back into that range of erasing history of all that hard work it's done previously.
NEUT36|So if you bought MFA during the rally before the rally and he didn't sell and are wondering what the hell happened, you had four chances to sell this thing.
NEUT37|Look at this four opportunities.
BULL38|That was a 70% run when it broke $2.00.
NEUT39|That's insane in just a couple of days.
NEUT40|So you had four opportunities to sell if you didn't sell it, then that only means you didn't sell it because you got greedy one, or because your long term.
BEAR41|And I would hope it's because your long term alright, MFA is coming down.
BULL42|If you still believe in it, you believe the market is going to continue to rally.
NEUT43|I would average into that position, get a better average if you bought at that top.
NEUT44|And then wait till it hits the 3456 dollar range.
NEUT45|Lock in profits or just hold a long term if you like to and collect those dividends.
NEUT46|So that's a quick analysis of MFA.
NEUT47|I still absolutely love MFA.
NEUT48|I'm still day training MFA.
NEUT49|I still have a long position in NFL Mother account MFA to the Moon baby watch.
NEUT50|My other video.
NEUT51|I talked about the market and with the markets doing why it came down.
NEUT52|Check that out if you want to understand why the markets moving the way it does, that's it.
NEUT53|Thanks for watching everyone.
