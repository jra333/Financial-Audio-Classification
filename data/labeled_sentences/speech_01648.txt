BULL0|"""Oh, we've got shares of BlackBerry on the move today in the right direction."
BULL1|It is up more than 34% after inking a deal with Amazon's web services and our tech editor Dan Hally is here now to fill us in.
NEUT2|So Dan, this is a company we haven't talked a lot about recently.
NEUT3|Yeah, blueberry right?
NEUT4|Kind of a blast from the past, but they have been working in the vehicle space for some time now.
NEUT5|They have a platform called Q&X Orc Unix as they sometimes refer to it and what they're doing is teaming up with a WS here.
NEUT6|Amazon Web Services to basically provide automakers with a better understanding of the data that their vehicles produced.
NEUT7|So think of it this way, you would have something like this Q&X platform connected to a WS and that's sucking up all the data points from the vehicle and then.
NEUT8|Automakers can then use that kind of information to provide better services to consumers.
NEUT9|Things like on the fly, update something that Tesla is already already been doing on its own, and some automakers have also experimented with, but this could be something that big name automakers might be able to use on their own.
NEUT10|And, you know, I've I've seen Q&X in action in the past.
BULL11|It's developed much more over the years and this kind of team up with a WS I think is something that has been long overdue for the auto industry.
NEUT12|Some kind of connectivity that's beyond.
NEUT13|Just the kind of infotainment systems that we have, but Moreover a full kind of suite of different connections that will allow automakers to better understand their vehicles and then consumer behavior as well.
NEUT14|Who do you consider to be a direct competitor of BlackBerry these days down?
NEUT15|For something like this, for Q&XI would consider any other OEM that's really in the auto space as far as the integration of electronics.
NEUT16|So look they have done a lot with infotainment systems.
NEUT17|Obviously there's plenty of competition in that space that Apple and Google among them, but you know, as far as the actual old BlackBerry goes, the phones, that's not something that a lot of people are going to be interested in anymore.
NEUT18|I think it's mostly just look we have the iPhone.
NEUT19|We have Android devices.
NEUT20|BlackBerry tried to come back for a hot minute with.
NEUT21|An Android device of its own, but I don't really see them coming back in that kind of market.
BULL22|I think it's really about the security capabilities that they have, and then this Q&X offering, which you know has been used by automakers, OEM automakers to be integrated into their own systems, and I think if they can better do that this team up with a WS could make for a formidable solution and really provide the understanding as to how vehicles are being used.
NEUT23|And you know, potentially look if it's listening to all the sensors it could give you an idea of where different things may fail sooner.
BULL24|You know that obviously remains to be seen, but you can imagine where the kind of connectivity like this could improve the overall capabilities of vehicle and automaker in the long run.
NEUT25|Now, alright, there are there.
NEUT26|Of course, the BlackBerry faithful out there.
NEUT27|The smaller mighty group, but you're right, tough for them to go mainstream in a big way.
BULL28|"Thanks, Dan."""
