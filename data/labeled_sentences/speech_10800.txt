NEUT0|"""Talk to us first about Arno's fortune."
NEUT1|Why has it grown so much this year?
NEUT2|Was absolutely spikes were talking about growth, about $39 billion alone in 2019 so far, and that the main reason for that is just huge sort of appetite among consumers for luxury or knows.
NEUT3|Obviously the CEO of LVMH biggest luxury company in the world.
NEUT4|And that's basically on fire.
NEUT5|It's kind of every every earnings.
BULL6|It's been very popular in China.
NEUT7|It's been sort of incorporating some new brands.
BULL8|It's been buying very well and that's really boosted our nose fortunes to a level we've never really seen for a European.
NEUT9|Again dude, I was going to ask you how does this compare to Europeans are pulled up.
NEUT10|The rich go function on the Bloomberg to take a look at where he is and there aren't as many Europeans in the top as there are Americans, which would be obvious I suppose.
NEUT11|No, no, absolutely.

NEUT14|The European richest Americans is much more tech, but in Europe it's all luxury and in some cases industrial like the BMW.
NEUT15|OK.
NEUT16|He's not going to stop Jeff Bezos, right?
NEUT17|I mean, he has a huge lead, almost double that fortune.
NEUT18|Yeah, he's bezels.
NEUT19|A good few billion ahead.
NEUT20|I think it's an really.
BEAR21|Businesses narrowed that lead just because of his divorce.
NEUT22|Recently.
NEUT23|No, it seems unlikely.
BULL24|"Just because Amazon as well as LVMH is performing pretty well right now."""
