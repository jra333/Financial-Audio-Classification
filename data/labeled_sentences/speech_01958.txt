NEUT0|"""Hope you're hungry, because today we'll be talking about Chili's."
NEUT1|Nope, not that kind of Chili's when I'm man.
NEUT2|I hope you're hungry.
NEUT3|I'm hungry for the hustle.
NEUT4|In this video, we'll be talking about a cryptocurrency that has the potential to skyrocket in 2021.
NEUT5|Chili's, also known by its ticker symbol CHZ.
NEUT6|It's your first time here.
NEUT7|Welcome every day I posting videos except when I have enough data which doesn't happen too often.
NEUT8|I regularly make updates on stocks and other cryptocurrencies, so make sure hit the subscribe button for that to my regular viewers.
NEUT9|What's up?
BULL10|Welcome back.
BULL11|Thanks for being here.
NEUT12|But that being said, as jump right into the video.
NEUT13|Let's talk money.
BULL14|According to their official website, Chili's is the world's leading blockchain fintech provider for sports and entertainment.
NEUT15|It is also the exclusive tokenofsocios.com.
NEUT16|Social.com is a website where sports fans can buy tokens of their favorite teams.
NEUT17|They will bunch of big name soccer teams.
NEUT18|Most of my audience comes from the United States so I have to say soccer.
NEUT19|But yes, so everyone outside the USI understand.
NEUT20|It's called football.
NEUT21|And honestly the name makes more sense in soccer.
NEUT22|But anyways, some of the big teams are available on this platform or FC Barcelona or Messy place.
NEUT23|Juventus, where Cristiano Ronaldo place Paris Saint German also known as PSG and the biggest club in France.
BULL24|What I think is really cool about this platform as it gives fans more direct interactions with their favorite teams.
NEUT25|As an example, fast one Chili's tokens will be able to vote on surveys that will directly decide things like what type of merchandise their team will be able to sell.
NEUT26|Surprisingly, even the UFC is on here.
NEUT27|I'll leave a link to the website in the description.
NEUT28|That way you can do your own digging.
NEUT29|It's always, Please remember that I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT30|You should always do your own due diligence, but in my opinion, when a project does seem crazy games like Chili's, I think it's at least something to consider.
NEUT31|Let's take a look at the recent growth of Chili's in 2020.
NEUT32|Chili's was trading between one set in two cents.
BEAR33|But in 2021, chills began to skyrocket.
BULL34|On March 12, 2021, Chili's reached an all time high of 89.15 cents.
NEUT35|That means if you would about Chili's pretty much anytime in 2020 would have sold its all time high either, but at least 50 extra money.
NEUT36|$100 could have been turned into $5000 or 1000 to 50,000.
BEAR37|Chile since then has taken a significant dip and is currently trading at $0.56.
BULL38|This is a 35% discount from its all time high, just a few days ago.
NEUT39|If you really believe in this project, this can be a great time to get in.
NEUT40|So where do you invite Chili's?
NEUT41|It's a little hard to get your hands on Chili's right now as it's now available on mainstream crypto exchanges such as Coinbase.
NEUT42|However, according to coin market cap, you can purchase Chili's on crypto exchanges such as Binance, Wabi Kucoin and FT X.
NEUT43|As we know soccer is the most popular sport in the world and while this might not be a revolutionary concept, is definitely something that provides value to a large audience.
NEUT44|"I wouldn't be surprised if a Chili's token is worth $1.00 in just a few weeks or even a few dollars by summer."""
