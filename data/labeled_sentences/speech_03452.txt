BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This video chart on ticker symbol Cann we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT2|What do I mean by 30 minute in case maybe new charts instead of each of these candle sticks here representing one days worth of price action which is what you would normally see.
NEUT3|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT4|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT5|It's actually just today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT6|I'll let you this time frame.
NEUT7|I think it does a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price and then makes mapping out with levels of support and resistance a bit easier to see.
NEUT8|I've done this analysis before a few times in the past last week, so that is where this green line annotation is coming from, and that's what's going to kick off the updates that need to be made, and this update is just based on a foundational rule in charting which states when levels of support are broken.
NEUT9|An closed love below they do tend to act as resistance, so $4.20 was that level of support, but now that the prices blow up, this would be considered.
BULL10|You know that near term level of resistance in the event, the price can get back above 420.
NEUT11|Next key level is going to be that Purple line right there.
NEUT12|Which is the famous.
NEUT13|50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average for the same reason as 420.
BEAR15|Meaning this was a level of support, but now that the price is broken below the 50.
NEUT16|You would now expect it to act as resistance as far as the overall chart is concerned, the Bulls are still in full control and I'll explain what I mean by that in a second.
BEAR17|But has the chart lost some of its attractiveness?
NEUT18|Yeah, absolutely.
BEAR19|Now keep in mind there's a big difference between being totally ruined and losing some attractiveness.
BEAR20|The reason it has lost them as some of its attractiveness is because it's not only broken below that purple line.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|But then continue to separate to the downside, and for those of you that have watched my videos in the past, maybe Remember Me saying that hey, you know what?
NEUT23|As long as the price stays above that Purple line, the Bulls 100% or in control the Bulls 100% you know are in full health.
NEUT24|Well know now that the price is below it again, is the entire chart ruined?
BEAR25|No, but you can't sit here and say that the Bulls are in 100% control either because the price or I should say the Bulls are starting to show some signs of weakness.
NEUT26|So as far as next potential areas of support or concern, next key one right here at 365 and I made a comment about how the.
BEAR27|The overall chart is still bullish.
NEUT28|What do I mean by that?
BEAR29|Especially after such a big pullback?
NEUT30|Well, I'm not saying this will happen, but just to kind of answer that question.
NEUT31|Let's say the price actually does come all the way down to 365.
NEUT32|Right around there, do something like that and then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT33|Even if that were to happen, what would that?
NEUT34|What would you still have from a big picture perspective?
NEUT35|While you have a set of lows there, you'd have this set of loans right there.
NEUT36|You'd have that Lowe's down there.
NEUT37|You picture each of these stair steps and the big picture stair steps would still be going in the upward direction.
NEUT38|So sure, that's not preferable, but you know, again, assuming you care about more of a broad time horizon, you know the Bulls even with the pullback today do still have an opportunity to build a higher base, and that's the name of the game if you're interested in building those long term uptrends.
NEUT39|Gotta put in those higher lows, so we'll see if the Bulls can get that job done or not.
NEUT40|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT41|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT42|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT43|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT44|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT45|It's completely free.
NEUT46|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT47|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
