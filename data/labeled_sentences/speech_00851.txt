NEUT0|"""Hey everybody crypto Mentor 99."
NEUT1|How you doing?
NEUT2|It is Friday, July 17th, 2020.
NEUT3|Dinner time.
BEAR4|I just got done with dinner.
NEUT5|I said Mrs. Crypto Mentor 99.
NEUT6|This little guys gotta do a few videos so today's stock trade.
NEUT7|Which technically was yesterday stock trade Thursday.
NEUT8|Let me explain.
NEUT9|So for those of you that follow me.
NEUT10|I like to buy PMPIXPMPIX.
NEUT11|It's a leverage trade.
NEUT12|It's not 3X or 2X.
NEUT13|It's like 1 1/2.
NEUT14|And.
NEUT15|PMPIX not that it's confusing the closing price of PMPIX every day is based on.
NEUT16|The.
NEUT17|Close of DJ GSP.
NEUT18|I know that sounds DJ GSP so like here's an example.
NEUT19|Today DJ GSP closed at three oh 765.
BULL20|It was up 2.87%.
NEUT21|You take that 2.87 times the leverage.
NEUT22|1.5 That's PMPIX.
NEUT23|Does that make sense?
BEAR24|So yesterday gold dipped.
BULL25|Golds been above 1800.
NEUT26|So like I gotta wait for it to go back to 1800 or a little bit below.
NEUT27|And to make matters more confusing, DJ GSP is somewhat related.
NEUT28|To gold.
NEUT29|Uhm?
NEUT30|How many put the video below of a tutorial that I did awhile back, but anyhow, so I went yesterday.
NEUT31|Uhm?
NEUT32|PMPIX was 7474.
NEUT33|But you have to like put your order in at like 355 Eastern Central Standard Time.
BULL34|An I had no idea what what DJ GSP was going to do today it was up 2.87% * 1.5.
NEUT35|That's the leverage train of PM.
NEUT36|I know it's confusing but once you get it down.
NEUT37|I want to be humble.
NEUT38|I don't say it's easy money but.
NEUT39|It's easy money.
NEUT40|So overnight from last night and I sold today.
NEUT41|Uhm?
NEUT42|OK, shouldn't say easy money PMPIX 1 from 7474.
BULL43|To 77.96, which is basically a four point 3% treiso overnight.
NEUT44|I made 4.31%.
BULL45|Not as good as crypto's.
BEAR46|But not bad.
NEUT47|Next week I never like to hold any of these.
NEUT48|My day trades which I am holding on to a few.
NEUT49|I even talked about him lately.
NEUT50|But I wanted to close out my position on PMPIX for the weekend.
NEUT51|What did gold close at today?
NEUT52|Gold closed at 1810?
NEUT53|Anyhow, I'll put the link below to the tutorial video that I did a while back on this subject.
NEUT54|Crypto Mentor 99.
NEUT55|Making some money.
NEUT56|"Love y'all bye bye."""
