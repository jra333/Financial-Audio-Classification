BULL0|"""Ford Motors sales in the fourth quarter were strong in North America."
BEAR1|Unfortunately for shareholders.
BEAR2|Ford also sells vehicles in other parts of the world, and that's not going very well these days were on no.
NEUT3|Is there any reason to get excited about owning a stock like Ford or GM?
NEUT4|I have a hard time coming up with one unless you get into the value investing argument, but in this case there's too much that you would need to bet on.
NEUT5|They've got to really turn this business around.
NEUT6|The restructuring is ongoing around the globe trying to Europe.
NEUT7|They're betting bigger on trucks and SUV's in the US.
BEAR8|There's an 11 billion restructuring overseas.
NEUT9|It's going to take several years to complete that.
NEUT10|Who knows how successful it will be?
BEAR11|They're cutting $25 billion in costs by 2020.
NEUT12|You know, there's a lot on the come here.
NEUT13|It's hard to say what's going to happen.
BEAR14|They declined to give profit guidance for 2019, but they tried to dance around and make some comments, which left investors a little unpleased unfulfilled.
NEUT15|So you know, this is one I would just.
NEUT16|And I'd watch it and take some interest in it, but I would not want to own it.
NEUT17|I'm not saying he's necessarily on the hot seat, but Jim Hackett's been the CEO of Ford Motor for about a year and a half.
BEAR18|The stocks down 20% during that time really seems like if that guy and his executive team have any rabbits that they can pull out of their respective hats, this would be the year to do it.
NEUT19|Yeah, but it's tough to do that.
NEUT20|You, you take the reins of something that's kind of a mess and you gotta set up expectations.
NEUT21|We say I'm going to come in here and do my best, but you gotta give me several years 'cause I can't turn something like this on a dime.
NEUT22|Any chance these guys go knocking back on Alamo alleys door?
NEUT23|"Say you interested in more never know."""
