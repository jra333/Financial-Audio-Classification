NEUT0|"""Here today with famed value investor Jeremy Grantham, founder of Boston Fund manager GMO."
NEUT1|Jeremy, let's get straight to it.
NEUT2|Is the US market in a bubble or is it different this time?
NEUT3|That that it really is a rap thing question.
NEUT4|You have to agree.
NEUT5|It doesn't have the characteristics of a bubble, I think.
NEUT6|A simple way of defining a bubble is that it has to have nearly perfect fundamentals.
NEUT7|Which have to be irrationally extrapolated with considerable euphoria around you.
NEUT8|Remember the style from 2000 or Japan in 89?
NEUT9|Or the US housing market.
BEAR10|House prices will never decline on 1929.
NEUT11|In the old days was a classic.
NEUT12|We have almost none of that euphoria.
NEUT13|We also have very.
BEAR14|Imperfect fundamentals.
BEAR15|The productivity rate is fairly dismal and has been all this cycle.
BEAR16|The GDP growth rate has consequently been very anemic and has been all this cycle.
NEUT17|It's hard to know what fundamentals would be considered brilliant.
NEUT18|It's hard to see how they're being extrapolated indefinitely and it's very hard to see what constitutes a material amount of euphoria.
NEUT19|It's only the other day people were lining up to commit.
NEUT20|1020 Thirty year money for guaranteed no real return.
NEUT21|This is not a real description of Mad desire to invest in the stock market.
NEUT22|OK, so the Bell boys in the lifts aren't giving you tips, and that's a that's a good sign that it's not wildly exciting, but at the same time you're not that keen on on US equities.
NEUT23|I mean, why not be a big buyer of US equities if people are really, you know, not not excited about them.
NEUT24|Well, getting back to your nasty question about this time is different.
NEUT25|Value managers always like to say.
NEUT26|It's never different, but.
NEUT27|I think it's it's fair to say this time is.
NEUT28|Decently different.
NEUT29|Give the two simple most important examples.
BULL30|The profit margins of U.S. companies have been 30% higher since 97 than they were in the prior 70 years.
NEUT31|30% higher is not a small number.
BULL32|It gives you a lot more cash flow.
NEUT33|And.
NEUT34|They haven't been spending it on growth, they've been.
BEAR35|A little lower on CapEx.
NEUT36|And.
NEUT37|Consequently, they have a lot more leftover than they used to have.
NEUT38|And that makes for a very different game.
NEUT39|The other thing that's different.
NEUT40|Is the price?
BULL41|The price reflects this enormous increase in cash flow and has gone up by 75%, so the peas on a 10 year Shiller basis are fully 7075% higher than they were.
NEUT42|For a really the previous hundred years, so two incredibly important things have clearly been different.
NEUT43|Does that mean you're ready to buy the dip and we just had a dip?
BEAR44|The some disappointment around Trump a bit of a dip bit of a debt.
NEUT45|Not not drastic, but that was that was back in the good old days.
BULL46|That was a good days work in India.
NEUT47|1 1/2 or 2%.
NEUT48|I mean nothing really.
NEUT49|We might nibble some stocks.
BEAR50|I should think we would if the market went down 1520 percent, 15 or 20%.
NEUT51|Yeah, I mean, OK, that's a.
NEUT52|Just an ordinary day at the office, 15 to 20% / 6 or nine months.
NEUT53|It doesn't change the outcomes for pensioners or anything.
BULL54|"And an shouldn't be taken that seriously, but it's good to have some cash up your sleeve if it happens."""
