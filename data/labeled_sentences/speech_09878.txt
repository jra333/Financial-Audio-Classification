BULL0|"""Time now for futures in focus and we're looking at gold up a little bit on relation to the $2000 stimulus bill that passed the House yesterday."
NEUT1|The Senate is going to have to confront that maybe later on today, so up to 1883 announced running now Bloomberg's Eddie Vander Walt joining us.
NEUT2|Hey Eddie, you have a pretty good idea when it comes to goal.
NEUT3|You can come at it with some skepticism here.
NEUT4|Once the actual upside if we continue to get a weaker dollar, if we continue to get lower real yields.
NEUT5|Yeah, I think those are all the big talking points Alex, but you know what you hit the the real number they had last time we spoke.
NEUT6|You talked about the moving average and we're seeing we saw that play a real role in boosting gold prices and we felt like a little bit, but I think the technical side all the momentum for gold it's it's sagged, a little bit cold doesn't?
NEUT7|It doesn't feel as a fish as it did in the first half 2020.
NEUT8|You know all of that excitement is sort of drained out of the gold market, doesn't feel is a fish that that may be the quote.
NEUT9|Of the day for me, Eddie.
NEUT10|Does it move with that?
NEUT11|What is its relationship with Bitcoin?
NEUT12|I feel like a year ago if we would have spoken.
NEUT13|Some might say that they're both safe havens.
NEUT14|They're going to move together, etc.
NEUT15|What's the deal with it now?
NEUT16|Yeah, so look, these are the.
NEUT17|It's tempting to say that it goes up in 2020.
BULL18|Bitcoins up in 2020.
NEUT19|There must be some sort of relationship.
NEUT20|If we look at that.
NEUT21|Look at look at the two assets we we really seem very different drivers and Bitcoins rally came in the latter half of the year.
NEUT22|Goals really came in the in the in the early half.
NEUT23|Beer I think.
NEUT24|Really they are being driven by by different sets of investors, but there are things that they have in common.
BEAR25|I think you know Bitcoin and gold are both partially driven by the fear that unconventional monetary policy have gone too far.
NEUT26|Law, and they've also been driven by, you know, just the excess liquidity sloshed sloshing around in the system, but Bitcoin star is in the ascendant.
BEAR27|Goals, is is failing.
NEUT28|So that means that you don't need to have investors sell out of gold to buy Bitcoin.
NEUT29|They can be 2 investor classes or someone can own both for the same reasons.
NEUT30|Right, I don't think these.
NEUT31|I don't think these are necessarily competing assets.
NEUT32|They say they have very little in common.
NEUT33|They you know, in terms of they, they take correlations with other aspects in terms of what they do in a portfolio setting.
NEUT34|Bitcoin still a very risk on the asset and it it it plays a lot more like venture capital might in your portfolio winners Gold still holds his inflation busting properties and Haven Haven demand.
NEUT35|Before I let you go any what's your top metal pick for 2021?
NEUT36|Where do you think the most flow is going to go to?
NEUT37|I feel like I copper is so hot at the moment, but you know what?
NEUT38|"It just feels like they that copper tray doesn't feel like it's tired, it just it just feels like that copper trades got legs."""
