NEUT0|"""What's up traders?"
NEUT1|Welcome to another see space trading video.
NEUT2|As always, welcome my subscribers guys.
BULL3|I appreciate the follow along and so far so good on Facebook.
BEAR4|Is sitting all over this area of support which we've been looking at the last few days after that big fall off here.
NEUT5|And he's just kind of floating here.
NEUT6|And if you're been keeping up, I did draw this line here kind of showing you the the way just been taking place between this line and this level of support here and in the next level.
BULL7|Support out of 166.
NEUT8|And then I believe it was even yesterday.
NEUT9|I notice something happening here or had a miniature away tear that was kind of forming and we just wanted to see what happens if you could pop out of here and run up here and touch this before it came back down, or if this was the beginning of it coming out of this wage and breaking this this.
NEUT10|This line here so.
NEUT11|Go back to daily.
BEAR12|I know we had a gap down several days ago.
BULL13|It's moved all the way back up to 187, almost 188 before coming off.
NEUT14|After some bad news.
BULL15|Nor Facebook's a great company in the future is bright for Facebook.
BULL16|If you're wanting to get along and you're looking at going 510 years, he'll jump in now 'cause this is, you know, a great opportunity to get in for the long term is my in my opinion, so but you know, we're all in here trying to make a quick Buck getting it out.
BULL17|It's getting close, is it is consolidating.
NEUT18|But it's, it's me.
NEUT19|Still is too early 'cause it could easily touch this line here, or maybe even pop a little over this line.
NEUT20|Maybe hit 175 tomorrow and it looks like it's about to break.
NEUT21|And then they're bought.
NEUT22|Bears will come in and push this thing back in the seller to come in and sell out and send this thing to 166 quickly.
NEUT23|So be cautious.
NEUT24|Continue to look.
NEUT25|Be patient and just wait for some confirmation.
BULL26|We're getting closer.
NEUT27|Let's look at the hourly.
NEUT28|And we opened up here to this at.
NEUT29|This I've shooting star basically inverted hammer.
NEUT30|Not sure to coin the right term but it basically went from one end of this wage to the other.
NEUT31|And then it just kind of just rode the bottom of this this line here all day and which is you know, is nice to see that these lines sometimes work.
NEUT32|And then here in the last hour this thing shut up very good volume units over your average volume and this shot all the way up to one 7424 before pulling down and you know closed out at one 7371 here.
NEUT33|So we'll have to keep an eye on it.
BULL34|Things are looking up.
NEUT35|For Facebook, however, we still haven't confirmed.
NEUT36|Reversal yet release.
NEUT37|I have it so stay tuned, go ahead and subscribe if you'd like to follow along.
NEUT38|I do Facebook, I do spy.
NEUT39|I do Amazon a couple others like the video.
NEUT40|If you got anything out of it, comment below.
NEUT41|If you got any questions.
NEUT42|If you see something here that I don't see it as they've actually saying this now, the 15 minute you want to watch how it popped out of his wedge here and then come back down.
NEUT43|And the beautiful thing about this is it found support on this meaning that it should possibly right here.
NEUT44|And then pop up so we gotta keep it on this way.
NEUT45|Just some things forming here.
NEUT46|And it does look good, so check back tomorrow and see where we're at and go ahead and subscribe to follow along guys.
BULL47|"I appreciate it and I will speak to you tomorrow later."""
