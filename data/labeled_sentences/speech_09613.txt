NEUT0|"""Total wagers on Sunday."
BEAR1|Super Bowl are expected to decrease 37% from last year to about 43 billion, according to a survey from the American Gaming Association.
BULL2|Despite 36 million Americans gaining access to legal betting markets in their home states.
BEAR3|Part of the reason working from home employees won't have their office pools and other pandemic related restrictions also holding things back.
NEUT4|Join us now.
NEUT5|Jason Robins, DraftKings CEO, and co-founder, is this an outlier?
NEUT6|In terms of the the state of the business, given the recent developments in legalized certain states, legalizing I was surprised to see that Jason.
NEUT7|I'm a little surprised too, but the office pools thing makes sense with a lot of people home.
NEUT8|I think that you know.
NEUT9|Still, the vast majority of wagers are happening in the illegal market, so if you look at the legal market, DraftKings those in five states last year with online sports book for the Super Bowl Warren 12 now so.
NEUT10|Lot more Americans have access to draft Kings now than they did last year.
NEUT11|Actually was wondering about that.
NEUT12|That's, you know, that's almost like the dark pool we we have estimates on how much goes on there, but we really don't know, so I don't know how we do any apples to apples or year over year comparisons for how DraftKings does?
NEUT13|Because you really can't do it it it was.
NEUT14|It was totally not reported, or at least not officially reported.
NEUT15|Prior to this.
NEUT16|I think it's just onwards and upwards every time we have another election.
NEUT17|In November, in more states, start going this way for a lot of reasons too.
BULL18|Yeah, I agree.
BULL19|I mean, we're very excited about this Super Bowl.
NEUT20|We have two big promotions.
NEUT21|One is a $55 million free pool that has a million top prize.
NEUT22|And if you enter you get a guaranteed prize up to $25,000.
NEUT23|So all you have to do is enter for free and then we also have a really cool odds boost we're doing on the sports book where any team scores a touchdown in the Super Bowl.
NEUT24|You double your money, so no guarantees.
NEUT25|But I imagine most Super Bowls if not all then who's that when the dead come out?
NEUT26|I haven't I gotten.
BULL27|Odds boost on on a pick.
NEUT28|A week ago I've had money on the table since a week ago after Kansas City.
NEUT29|I took one last year in the last 7 minutes of the Super Bowl.
NEUT30|Remember I was out in California in a car and I'm like, Oh my God, it's happening at time is great.
NEUT31|So what is this?
NEUT32|If you have to sign up to do that or is it for existing now?
NEUT33|Existing to anybody new or existing?
NEUT34|I'm not sure exactly when we posted it, but it's there now to go.
NEUT35|Good wonder that's one of those no brainers.
NEUT36|That's why we call it.
NEUT37|We call them no brainers.
NEUT38|Yeah, yeah, you know what it is Jason it's you giving me back like .001% about what you took you already taken have taken from me you're going to give it back to me if someone scores a touchdown but I will take it because then I can do I can do more better you know we had PayPal on not on about we've been talking about it a lot to hit unbelievable results an I had people tweeting me that that even.
BULL39|PayPal is benefiting from legalized gaming 'cause so many people are able to to fund their sports book.
NEUT40|It's the easiest way through PayPal and I've done that actually.
BULL41|PayPal is a great company.
NEUT42|We're very excited to be partnering with them and you know, a lot of customers really prefer to have a method like PayPal.
NEUT43|They feel more comfortable using it than perhaps other methods, so very cool to see that they're in.
BULL44|And I think you know they've had a lot of success.
NEUT45|That is a lot of people now that aren't seeing each other in person and PayPal is an easy and convenient way to transfer money.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
