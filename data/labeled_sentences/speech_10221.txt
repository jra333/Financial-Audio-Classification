NEUT0|"""Very much something not informed today accompanied followed closely plug power."
NEUT1|One thing that we don't like to see you probably with miss or restatements.
NEUT2|Yeah now I was going back and forth with Andy Marsh.
NEUT3|He is the CEO of Plug Power an I actually know restatements are good to repeat issue.
NEUT4|There are some complex accounting.
NEUT5|It will not impact.
NEUT6|It's not.
BULL7|Welcome back, let's get to a mad dash and we're actually here.
BULL8|We're standing up a little bit.
BULL9|It's nice, good to see you thank you Lee back and forth.
BULL10|Thank you very much.
NEUT11|Something not informed today accompanied followed closely plug power.
NEUT12|One thing that we don't like to see you probably with miss or restatements.
NEUT13|Yeah now I was going back and forth with Andy Marsh.
NEUT14|He is the CEO of Plug Power an I actually know restatements are good.
NEUT15|Repeat once again but there were some complex accounting.
NEUT16|It will not.
NEUT17|Impact it's non cash which does matter 'cause you always want to see if cash goes down you know that.
NEUT18|That means often something that we really don't want to see.
BULL19|I think that they're going to work to resolve it very quickly.
BEAR20|KPMG had an issue at the last minute with what was happening and I the stocks been been at peak clearly.
NEUT21|But I do long term believe in it.
NEUT22|I am not ready.
NEUT23|I know that accounting regularis equals cell.
NEUT24|I'm still digging on this.
NEUT25|I want to know who blew the whistle was.
NEUT26|A new order wasn't someone at the company that does matter.
NEUT27|What was it related to?
NEUT28|It was related.
NEUT29|Yes, it had to do with highly complex involving significant judgments on how to apply gap given our leadership, new and rapidly developing industry actually quoting.
NEUT30|So I don't want to screw this up, sure, but what they're basically saying is that while there's no material issues, there are ways to be able to.
NEUT31|I think Alan had the best note, but there are ways to be able to to assess how much what they should be talking about.
BEAR32|How much they getting the last thing, but it has to do with their true fuel cells and I didn't want to see it obviously, and it's very, very negative.
NEUT33|When you see this, but it's also it's not.
NEUT34|No one lied to my expectation.
NEUT35|I don't think they did, but I it's going to take a little while.
BEAR36|True is downgraded on this even though guidance unchanged.
NEUT37|What I care about is the guidance unchanged.
NEUT38|Not doing, but it David did what it is.
NEUT39|Of course it's holy tide to topic 842 accounting treatment.
BEAR40|OK, well that doesn't help me like you will still take other people.
NEUT41|That is the problem.
NEUT42|I studied it and study and gave it to my friend's account and.
BEAR43|"And he said, look, it's not that bad, but at the same time it is very hard to understand and therefore may be the reason why people say I'll ask questions later."""
