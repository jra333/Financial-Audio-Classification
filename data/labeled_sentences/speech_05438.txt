NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the weekly charts of the crude oil market, and as you can see, the crude oil markets have."
NEUT1|Seeing quite a bit of choppiness during the week as we approach this gap, and you would expect that that's this is normally.
NEUT2|This is normally quite difficult to breakthrough, but to break to the top of does seem to be the norm.
NEUT3|That does tend to happen more often than not, so I think we're going to try to fill this gap.
NEUT4|But really, at this point it's likely that.
BEAR5|If we break down below 30, that could be negative.
BULL6|I think we're going to fill this gap $41.00 about as high as we go.
NEUT7|Brent.
NEUT8|Same scenario we going to get a 41st and then to 45 at that point.
BULL9|Difficult to think it's going to continue to go higher.
BEAR10|We break down below 30 here.
NEUT11|Then we should continue to go lower.
NEUT12|"Don't get me wrong, I'm not publish a crude oil, but I do recognize that the technical filling of the gap probably has to happen."""
