BULL0|"""Welcome back to Bloomberg West."
NEUT1|I'm Nicole lapin.
NEUT2|We have smartphones.
NEUT3|We have smart cars, but what about smart windows?
NEUT4|Yes, there could be a smart everything.
NEUT5|We take a look at a company that makes dynamic class which let's users change the tint of their windows.
NEUT6|Using Wi-Fi or mobile device.
NEUT7|Here with more on the next generation of window glass is Corey Johnson.
NEUT8|How does this work?
NEUT9|I seem like people have glasses eyeglasses that will turn darker as they hit the sun.
NEUT10|Is that how this works?
NEUT11|Yeah, so that view we manufacture dynamic loss.
NEUT12|Dynamic glasses and intelligent glass system.
NEUT13|What it is is it can take user preferences and then automatically adjust the condition of the window glass to the conditions that are changing outside women user preferences.
NEUT14|So you can say on a wintry sunny day I want my window to do this.
NEUT15|You can have a conference room versus your office versus your living room that maybe need to be set differently based on the function you're trying to do inside for the same outside conditions.
NEUT16|So many conference room dark your kitchen bright.
NEUT17|And the same weather condition as I don't have conference room in the kitchen in the same house.
NEUT18|But you know that aside, and certainly when the weather is changing, you want to make sure that that room is being appropriately adjusted to your preferences.
BULL19|Well, yeah, there.
NEUT20|Obviously two big concerns.
NEUT21|Or if there's light and there's energy.
NEUT22|Yeah, so absolutely.
NEUT23|It's it's not just light, it's views, it's light, it's comfort, it's energy efficiency, its ability to design buildings, the way they're meant to be because we put glass in the 1st place to have use.
NEUT24|Everybody wants to view.
NEUT25|Everybody wants that connection to the outside.
NEUT26|Designers want to build buildings with more and more glass.
NEUT27|However, you have heat and glare.
NEUT28|Now you got an example of it here and you control this with your iPhone.
NEUT29|Absolutely.
NEUT30|So I have here something that represents a window glass.
NEUT31|It's a double pane window glass system, just like represents this exact product that you sell are not exactly what we sell, but on a much larger scale.
NEUT32|We can make it 5 foot wide by 10 foot tall, so it's really ready for commercial scale.
NEUT33|I have in my hand my iPhone and I can simply wirelessly control what happens to this window glass based on simply changing my.
NEUT34|My iPhone look what happens.
NEUT35|It's magical and you can see my hand right now.
NEUT36|As you look through the glass and anyway you will see something appear as we start clearing other hand and now you can't see it.
NEUT37|OK, so look at it, there are no moving parts.
NEUT38|There's nothing that makes any noise like blinds or shades.
NEUT39|There's nothing to collect dust.
NEUT40|All you need to do is clean your glass and you're able to have that vivid view 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and magically you see here you start to appear.
NEUT41|This is really interesting to you.
NEUT42|How do you sell glass?
NEUT43|You know I bought Windows when I built my house and that was a whole process of sort of going through the different makers of the windows, but usually pick it based on the style and quality of the frame, not of the glass itself.
NEUT44|So how do you?
NEUT45|How do you sell this into the Windows market?
NEUT46|It's a great question, so today when you look at glass, you look right through it and you're supposed to look right through it.
NEUT47|You have a lot of choices for glass, single pane, double pane, triple pane, different types of codings known as low E coatings, but as an end user you can't really see it.
NEUT48|OK, and especially when you have glare and heat, you're used to closing blinds.
NEUT49|You're putting in massive air conditioning systems with this glass you have use all the time, and given that now you're actually able to interact with your window.
NEUT50|And really the most important part of the window is the glass, and so now you're going to shift your focus away from the frame, which you'll still have for aesthetic purposes and others, but really into what is the high performing part of the window, and that's the glass.
NEUT51|Interesting so far.
NEUT52|More interesting company, interesting product.
NEUT53|Will be interesting to watch how this is rolled out.
NEUT54|Across the world.
BULL55|Thanks a lot.
BULL56|"Thank you."""
