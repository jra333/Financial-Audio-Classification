NEUT0|"""Today we're going to look at a potential trade setup we had here in Disney."
NEUT1|This came after some earnings reports, so you can see here.
NEUT2|Basically it ran up early morning, started shopping around and creating a base, really started to form like a Pennant flag there.
NEUT3|And you can see once we got into this part and was holding above the 21 emhs here an above the 55 here.
BEAR4|So we were looking for a trendline break to the upwards direction holding the 21 as a stop loss.
BEAR5|So as soon as price violated that we would have exited the trade.
NEUT6|Either for loss or gain.
NEUT7|You can see once it broke out and really just bounce along this 21 ma.
NEUT8|Again, this is just a textbook trade.
NEUT9|Here we are holding above you all but all other support here and once it broke out it just didn't look back and the textbook exit for the trade would have been half position here and the other half position once it broke the 55.
NEUT10|So we just using the emmas is simple.
NEUT11|Price target range and you can see here once the RSI broke above the trendline, we have the trendline break on the price chart and the TTM squeeze was flowing in the upward direction here.
NEUT12|So when all these things lined, we would have been in the trade and just holding it as long as it held DMA support.
NEUT13|And that's the trade setup for Disney.
BULL14|"Thanks for watching."""
