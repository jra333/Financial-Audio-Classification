BULL0|"""Tesla is up 2% premarket as Elon Musk tweeted yesterday."
BEAR1|Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules.
NEUT2|I will be on the line with everyone else if anyone is arrested.
NEUT3|I ask that it only be me.
BEAR4|Plant was shut down for five weeks.
NEUT5|Jim and it sounds like you think he has, maybe not legal standing, but moral standing to do what he's doing here.
NEUT6|Look, I I think that he is a zealot.
NEUT7|I think he is correct in thinking that the whole thrust of this country is to put people to work.
NEUT8|Why do we presume that he can't do it in a fashion that safe?
NEUT9|I do not know.
NEUT10|I mean, I want this is not Tyson?
NEUT11|OK this is not Smithfield.
NEUT12|And why do we think this man necessarily is going to put people at risk?
NEUT13|When I look at my Twitter column, there are two kinds of people.
NEUT14|There are people who think that he's the greatest, and people think that he's willing to sacrifice people.
NEUT15|On the only order profit now he may not be as.
NEUT16|Say as concerned about Covid as every person in the world, but there's no indication that he's willing to sacrifice peoples lives.
NEUT17|Why can't they make a deal?
NEUT18|I don't understand this.
NEUT19|It's time to open up that factory, and I think he's dead, right?
NEUT20|I don't want to violate the law, but come on this is it.
NEUT21|Do not do.
NEUT22|Do we not want this factory?
NEUT23|Open Secretary Mnuchin wants it open.
NEUT24|I don't know.
NEUT25|Do we have to present about it with him, yeah.
NEUT26|We we covered this with the secretary yesterday.
NEUT27|In fact, here's what he told us.
BULL28|I agree with Elon Musk is one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California and California.
NEUT29|Should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely where they're going to find as he's threatened.
NEUT30|He's moving his production to a different state.
NEUT31|Jimmy does have the argument that they're essentially the only OEM.
NEUT32|Now that is not allowed to open on a week where a lot of the other other big Three are going to open.
BULL33|Well, it's great.
NEUT34|I mean, we can't wait to OSHA.
NEUT35|OSHA still exists.
BEAR36|I'm sorry they would be valuable here.
NEUT37|We don't have standards.
NEUT38|We go.
BEAR39|There's a County unelected official that shutting down maybe one of the most important factories in the country.
NEUT40|I don't know.
NEUT41|I mean, if the president were to get involved and say look, I think that this is something we can all work out.
NEUT42|That would be very valuable.
NEUT43|But instead we're focused.
NEUT44|Now, maybe there will be a tweet says that we ought to get along instead of just trashing Comcast.
NEUT45|Whatever is being cat trashed.
NEUT46|But this this to me is right on the firing line of what's wrong with America.
NEUT47|This incredible disparity?
NEUT48|Everybody has.
BEAR49|Even a County commissioner can shut down a great company.
NEUT50|How is this possible?
NEUT51|How is it possible that we have just unfettered?
NEUT52|Should be in the Confederacy of anything, and I used the word confederacy not disparaging terms of the things they did wrong, but the idea that everybody seems to be equal when it comes to being able to tell someone not to do something, and you were supposed to be trying to open up America not close.
NEUT53|"Ameryka I don't get it at all."""
