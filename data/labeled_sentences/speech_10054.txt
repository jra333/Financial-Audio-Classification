NEUT1|This is Raj in this video.
NEUT2|We're going to look at Berkshire Hathaway so we will be looking at the analysis, valuation and returns.
NEUT3|So do watch till the end.
NEUT4|Now let's take a look at the analysis of Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL5|So everybody knows you know Berkshire Hathaway is a very stable company and very profitable company.
NEUT6|So let's see you know what the analysis says about this company.
NEUT7|So Morningstar provides a Berkshire Hathaway with the widest able mode and the SNP provides it within.
NEUT8|It is stable credit rating, so this once again proves you know what kind of a balance sheet Berkshire Hathaway has.
NEUT9|And they have an earnings per share growth stability rating of three out of five stars and they don't have the return of capital using the Joel Greenblatt's Weatherby.
NEUT10|'cause Berkshire Hathaway is considered as an insurance company.
NEUT11|So for banks and insurance companies we cannot calculate the return on capital using Joel Greenblatt's method since the Berkshire Hathaway doesn't provide any dividends, you know, let's jump into the valuation.
NEUT12|So for the year 2021 they are expected to make about $10.84 and their three year growth estimate is close to 8.56 percentage.
NEUT13|For the past ten years that they were trading around and earnings multiple offer 19.48.
NEUT14|So since they are not a growth company, we can use Mr. Peter Linz 15 times earnings multiple.
NEUT15|So if we use a 15 times earnings multiple, then they're fair values close to $162.60.
NEUT16|But you know, Berkshire Hathaway is one of those companies which always trades around.
NEUT17|You know above this earnings line or 15, and they constantly create around their blended PE multiple.
NEUT18|So if we use their reblended P then their fair value is $211.00.
NEUT19|Now let's take a look at what kind of returns we can get by buying Berkshire Hathaway today at the current market price of $240.
NEUT20|So using their earnings per share consensus up until 2023, so let's calculate the returns.
NEUT21|So as we saw before, right the year 2021, they're earnings per share is about $10.84, and for the past ten years they were trading in this earnings multiple, basically between 19 to 25 as 25 being their bubble valuation.
NEUT22|So if we use the same kind of multiple for 2021, they showed the trade around between $205.00 to 200.
NEUT23|$71.00 and for the year 2022 are there earnings is going to be about $11.94, so if we apply the same earnings multiple, they should trade between $227.00 to $300.00 for the year 2023.
NEUT24|Their earnings is going to be about $12.78 and they should trade between $243.00 to $320.00 so if we if they trade around $143 essentially will be making.
NEUT25|Zero percentage returns based on the current market price and if they are traded at 25 times their earnings multiple, then it should be around $320.00.
NEUT26|So in that case will be making about a 10 percentage return per year for the next three years.
BULL27|Thanks for watching.
