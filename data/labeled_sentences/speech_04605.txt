BULL0|"""Alright, so 'cause actually had a really great move today as well."
NEUT1|You can see this one form of strength that it did have.
NEUT2|This is typically what you see with cost.
NEUT3|You're going to see it either move up right in the morning or somewhere through the day.
NEUT4|You're going to see that large jump, and instead of seeing it right here, we've seen it right here where it did jump up to basically $24.78.
NEUT5|I was up about 100 plus dollars, but I feel like that wasn't enough to get to that point, but you can see that it does always go up and then come back down to Earth so I can tell you that cost looks amazing, right?
NEUT6|At times, it really does look amazing, but then sometimes it looks really, really bad, but all I know is that.
BULL7|Looking at them as a buy opportunity and be able to get in and get out and basically a point to where I can make some easy profits knowing that they are going to increase at least one day in the week.
BULL8|As long as they don't decrease a crazy amount, it's definitely great.
BULL9|"At $24.78 I wanted to push the 27 to make my profit."""
