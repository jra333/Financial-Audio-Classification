NEUT0|"""We got Steve Bruce Alilo to explain the the aberration that is on the screens that Google and favorable is actually happening."
BEAR1|Apple shares are down in the stock is down about 3:00.
NEUT2|We're going to see this.
NEUT3|We're going to see the price in a moment.
BEAR4|Yeah, by about 3% down about 3% today and it's down about 9% since hitting its most recent all time high last week.
BEAR5|So the stock has come now below 600 and we're down.
NEUT6|You see the chart here around 587.
BEAR7|You know this is the first real pullback that we've seen in Apple shares in quite awhile.
NEUT8|Definitely in 2012 and a lot of people are, you know, kind of looking at this saying, wow, this is pretty quick, but this is something that people were expecting.
BEAR9|You know, you know, at some point Apple needed to come back, it couldn't go up forever and so this is finally that moment and we're down about 9% from the high.
NEUT10|The big question is, is this going to continue?
BEAR11|Is this going to go even even further?
NEUT12|And the people that I'm talking to are skeptical.
NEUT13|They don't think that that.
BEAR14|This downdraft is going to last much longer.
NEUT15|They think that you know this, that there could be a floor around here in the stock could then move off this level and move on, not not spend, so there's a comment in Steves.
NEUT16|Note here from an analyst from Stifel.
BEAR17|Nicholas says there's some chatter that Apple could roll out an iPad mini and about 200 bucks, which would cannibalize sales of their more expensive full size iPads.
NEUT18|What do you make of that?
NEUT19|Do you think that's enough for a move down like this?
NEUT20|I don't think so.
NEUT21|That's pure speculation.
NEUT22|There hasn't really been too many reports about that.
NEUT23|Mini iPad, so I wouldn't put too much stock into that.
BEAR24|The one negative report that is, I think may be impacting the stock is the Justice Department, ebook, investigation and Settlement, which challenge Apple and the way they alleged they controlled prices on iBooks.
BEAR25|So they're losing some of that control, but I don't think that's a huge hit for them.
NEUT26|They really make a lot of money on the books they make most of their money on the devices that people use to buy the book, so I don't think that explains.
BEAR27|All of this negative sentiment around Apple, though it's probably one of the factors exactly.
NEUT28|I think when you when you look at the fundamentals, the fundamental picture for Apple is still the same as it was a week ago.
NEUT29|I mean, I think that you know the issues that you guys discussed.
BEAR30|There are certainly denting sentiment but not to the point where we should have a 9% correction from here.
BEAR31|I think that more importantly, there may be some technical aspects that are contributing to this decline.
BEAR32|I think once you got below 600 that was sort of a worrisome sign.
NEUT33|And then you saw people sell even more because of that, but.
NEUT34|Again, those are just.
NEUT35|Personally, I think that those are short term movements and they don't necessarily tell a longer term story here, and it's still so that that longer term chart that is massively is unbelievable so.
NEUT36|So let's let's let's also mentioned that Apple is such a big part of the NASDAQ now, and the S&P that it's pulling those dates.
NEUT37|Also, we need to move on to Google.
BEAR38|OK yeah, so well if you look at all other tech stocks were also getting hit Googles down about 3% and off about 7% from when it reported earnings last Thursday.
BEAR39|So and then other big tech companies are also getting hit today.
BEAR40|Priceline is down, Amazon is down.
BEAR41|I would say there's more of a reason for Google to see weakness now than there is for Apple because Google did just come out with its most recent earnings report.
BEAR42|It wasn't a blowout quarter by any means they beat on the earnings number, but the revenue number was either in line or slightly below.
NEUT43|What animals were seeing, there's also more fundamental concerns about the monetization of the mobile advertising space, which is where most of the consumer behavior is going.
BEAR44|A lot of the advertising revenues, certain shift to mobile, and a lot of the analysts raised concerns about lower.
NEUT45|Ad rates on mobile, so I think there is more of a reason for Google Video.
BEAR46|There's more of a more of a fundamental right click, right coming down and I'm afraid we have to wrap it back.
BULL47|Great work.
NEUT48|"Steve Russell, it's."""
