NEUT0|"""I think the market knows now gone through, you know last election and certainly the one that I focused on and with many others and put huge bets on Brexit."
NEUT1|If you recall that the polls are predicted of nothing, and so if you asked institutional investors or even individual ones, would you make bets or change asset allocations based on polls?
NEUT2|They would say no because it it doesn't reflect what the outcome in any way.
NEUT3|And I'm not against pollsters or anything, but they've been wrong pretty well all the time.
NEUT4|And so if you were trying to hedge your bets on this election based on prediction of polls, it would be useless information.
NEUT5|And it is.
NEUT6|I understand it's useful for the circus of cable television and if you watch the you know the various channels at night around these polls, it's it's fun.
NEUT7|It's entertaining, but it's irrelevant to the investor.
NEUT8|But but let me ask you, though you look at the polls, maybe one thing people actually making bets predicted in the like.
NEUT9|Maybe another thing or no.
NEUT10|Well, I'm I think they'll probably there's a 50% chance you're going to be wrong.
NEUT11|But if you're an investor, let's say last night I was I was talking with the sovereign investor in the UAE about are you.
NEUT12|Are you going to change your waiting to the S&P in any way that those funds generally index based on?
NEUT13|You know what you think is going to happen the election?
NEUT14|And they said it's irrelevant.
NEUT15|Who cares what matters to the investor and who's policy.
NEUT16|And you know, there's a lot of rhetoric and there's going to be a lot more about you.
NEUT17|Know Biden versus Trump on policy.
NEUT18|So if Trump wins more of the same in the market, understands what you're going to get there, you may not like him and I get all that stuff.
BULL19|But the policy's been very accommodative for investors, not just domestically.
NEUT20|Globally there's so much capital coming in the United States because of a more you know, accommodative fed, obviously.
NEUT21|At a deregulated environment, around energy and everything else.
NEUT22|Now tomorrow morning.
NEUT23|Or, you know, if Biden wins in early November, he inherits unemployment somewhere between 9:00 and 11%.
NEUT24|His number one mandated is going to get those people back to work.
NEUT25|Is he likely to raise taxes significantly on corporations?
NEUT26|No.
NEUT27|Is he going to start regulating the economy immediately and just put millions of people out of work in the energy sector?
NEUT28|This one badly beaten up no is.
NEUT29|Is he really going to implement the Green Deal?
NEUT30|No.
NEUT31|These are, this is what the market's telling you.
NEUT32|They don't believe any of that stuff and they're probably right, not too.
NEUT33|It's just noise because his mandate is going to be to get America back to work just like Trump has two and the Fed is going to remain at.
NEUT34|Basically, you know, removing price discovery from bonds.
NEUT35|You just heard that and so everything points to just more focus put if every sovereign out there is going to continue to allocate to the SNP and Ann.
NEUT36|It won't really matter.
NEUT37|It doesn't matter who wins the elections, nothing is going to change for at least the short to mid term, and that's why the market just couldn't give a damn.
NEUT38|And why nobody even watch is it anymore.
NEUT39|"It's a great service, very entertaining, but irrelevant."""
