NEUT0|"""Formally announced today."
NEUT1|Will it actually happen though?
NEUT2|That's a good question.
NEUT3|Liam Denning heard on the streets very own is here.
NEUT4|I'll tell you, I think I want this deal to go through just be 'cause I saw the combined company referred to as Glen XI.
NEUT5|Thought that was actually pretty clever and Glenn Strahta.
NEUT6|Although there pumping for blank or extra so well, it's a formal name.
NEUT7|I know I'm going to get as a nickname.
NEUT8|Glen X is right.
BULL9|Pretty good.
NEUT10|You gotta have a $90 million deal.
NEUT11|You gotta come up with something better than blanket just in combination.
NEUT12|Other names.
NEUT13|But there's a lot of the name right?
NEUT14|Glencore is first yeah.
NEUT15|That I guess some people right?
NEUT16|Yeah yeah, let's get into that.
NEUT17|Yeah, I mean there's a slight air of unreality about this deal, which is, you know, it's being called a merger of equals, but it really isn't, I mean.
NEUT18|Yes, they're talking about the fact that extra Sis top executives will hold all the top positions.
NEUT19|But you know, in reality it's just like the deal a little bit for it.
NEUT20|'cause it looks cosmetic to me, because in the end Glencore shareholders will at this current exchange ratio will end up controlling the group and the vast majority of Glencore shareholders are actually employees Ivan Glasenberg, their CEO of Blank or who will become the deputy in the.
NEUT21|In the combined group, will actually be the largest shareholder with something like 9% of the shares.
NEUT22|So the idea that he's going to somehow play second fiddle with Glencore will regard this as as as an equal deal is is somewhat unreal to me.
NEUT23|You know there are also other disparities, just in terms of you know extras, extras, relative cash flow, the size of its resource base, you know essentially what this looks like to me is a couple of things you know.
NEUT24|Glencore is a trading company and it's so much better to trade when you have physical assets.
NEUT25|Backing that trading because the way you make money is you exploit arbitrages and shortages, so if you're the guy who has the last ton of coal that everyone needs, you can charge an enormous amount of money for it.
NEUT26|That's how traders make their money and extras.
NEUT27|Assets will bring a lot to the table, but let's talk for about the extra shareholders because if this isn't really a merger of equals.
NEUT28|If this is a takeover, you would expect there to be some kind of premium given to the shareholders of extra right, that's right.
NEUT29|Or we necessarily seeing that though in the deal and in the market and the price of the stock.
BULL30|Pretty small, I'm kind of amazed that extractor is agreed to these terms.
NEUT31|The premium on offer and this is an all stock deals.
NEUT32|Then remember they're not really getting any cash for this, right?
NEUT33|Premium on offer is only about 8%, which is tiny for for a change of control and when you consider that control will pass to.
NEUT34|Not a diverse set of shareholders, but essentially a big block of Glencore employees.
BEAR35|You know that doesn't look good and we've already seen a couple of extra to shareholders.
BEAR36|Standard Life and Schroders come out and say we don't like these terms.
NEUT37|I mean, you always get a bit of that around emergent, but you know they need.
BEAR38|If 16% of Xstrata shareholders decide that they don't want to do is get all the deal then it would scuttle the deal.
NEUT39|Now.
NEUT40|However, there is one sticking point which is if the deal doesn't go through extra shareholders need to ask themselves.
NEUT41|OK, where does that leave us?
NEUT42|It will leave them holding a company which is still.
NEUT43|More than 1/3 owned by Glencore, which will be a spurned suitor, which obviously has a different agenda that is not a future that many extra shareholders are going to look forward to.
NEUT44|"So my guess is that the deal does actually happen, but I would expect them to hold out for a bit more, yeah?"""
