BEAR0|"""If you only looked at the closing prices like appreciate day, Dow finishing down 45 points as the advancing .18%, that's that gaining .50%."
BEAR1|But the truth is, things look awful bad around 2:00 o'clock.
NEUT2|If you like, we could have a huge role over Wall Street.
BEAR3|Was laser focused on the negatives were heading to the toughest part of the pandemic is going to be much worse than feared.
BEAR4|Retail sales were very weak.
BEAR5|the Fed admitted they can't do much to help.
BULL6|Then we heard some very positive chatter from Washington about the stimulus bill and from Fed Chief Powell.
BULL7|Sure enough, stocks turn around.
NEUT8|Crisis averted, as I see it, the Bears, once again the Bears.
BEAR9|Wrong, sure, this is an ugly moment, but we're about to cross the Jordan River after spending ages loss in the wilderness.
NEUT10|And there's a land of milk and honey on the other side.
NEUT11|That said, you know what?
BULL12|I'm actually thrilled by all the negativity because it means stocks can still go higher as long as we have doubters, we can route.
NEUT13|The market goes up when bears turned into bulls.
NEUT14|So think of the negativity that we saw all morning as the fuel.
NEUT15|When everyones positive.
NEUT16|Well, that's when you have to worry right now though, there's plenty of pessimism about the rally.
BEAR17|The conventional wisdom says this rally has to be bogus because the economy is in dire straits with dramatically weaker retail sales and spiking unemployment as states are forced to lock down.
BEAR18|Worse, the extra unemployment benefits and the eviction freeze both end in a couple of weeks.
BEAR19|Now I know most people have lossed faith in Washington.
NEUT20|Congress has spent months doing nothing, although that may be about to change.
NEUT21|Even without a stimulus package would suddenly seems a lot more likely.
BEAR22|I think this is the best of times worst of times situation.
BEAR23|I know you're sick of it.
NEUT24|I keep referring to ****.
NEUT25|It's probably really upset you, but this is a Dickensian moment.
NEUT26|Alright, it's not the Christmas cowboy, it's the Canyon.
NEUT27|It's the best of times for the wealthy.
NEUT28|Whether we're talking companies or individuals.
BEAR29|And it's the worst of time for small business and people living paycheck to paycheck work with no paychecks at all.
