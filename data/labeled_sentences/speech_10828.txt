BEAR0|"""You heard Michael talk about how there's no visibility right now in business for the next 6 to 12 months or the fear is that there isn't visibility."
BEAR1|This can't be good for companies that are trying to put the finishing touches on some big M and a deal.
NEUT2|No, it's not.
BEAR3|It's definitely with increased volatility in the markets, potentially a repricing as we price off the public markets.
NEUT4|This will.
NEUT5|This will probably do well to a significant, you know, perhaps hopefully just a breather, but certainly stop stopping some of the transactions that may very well be in place at this point.
NEUT6|And once they do, Mark for those deals are already out there.
BEAR7|Announced in the public, we're seeing the spreads on some of them go out.
BEAR8|A lot of them stayed fairly stable, but do you think buyers are going to renegotiate or even potentially walk away from deals because of the new employees?
NEUT9|As you know?
NEUT10|I mean the the ability to get out of a public, public public transaction is pretty de minimis.
NEUT11|The material adverse change clauses are very tightly written.
NEUT12|Market moves don't.
BEAR13|Really impacted, so I see very little ability to renegotiate those transactions and like you've been in this seat before, ahead of me.
NEUT14|Obviously Lehman Brothers.
NEUT15|When we went into that meltdown sort of handicap where we are now just in terms of the volatility and in terms of sort of the some of the bigger trends that are driving this this backdrop of uncertain.
NEUT16|So look, I mean, it's still early, right?
NEUT17|We've known for a while that the China trade issues are out there.
BULL18|There was some hope as you pointed out in the spring that we get a deal.
NEUT19|We were thought we were looking at a Brexit.
NEUT20|That would be, you know, sort of negotiated Brexit.
NEUT21|Now we're looking at hard Brexit.
NEUT22|You got an inverted yield curve and so that none of this is necessarily constructive.
NEUT23|For robust dominate market, which.
NEUT24|As you and I have talked about it, or its thin anyway, it's thin in terms of three out of nine industries that we cover are up this year.
NEUT25|It's all driven by North America, so you know, you gotta.
NEUT26|You gotta market.
BEAR27|That maybe is not quite as robust as one would like heading into somewhat look like pretty significant macroeconomic issues.
NEUT28|So Mark, you've been doing this for awhile, so this isn't the first sort of, I guess thin sort of market that you've gone through.
NEUT29|And I just wonder like what sort of the playbook that you use to sort of navigate your way through this.
NEUT30|You basically you gotta be.
NEUT31|Totally transparent with clients.
NEUT32|You've got to look at the environment and you know you gotta look.
NEUT33|I think transactions I've told that they have an analyst for a long time.
NEUT34|I've said this a lot in the past.
NEUT35|They become actionable that really, are you know important could can still likely get done here.
NEUT36|A lot of the nice to have stuff is going to be harder to get done in an environment like this, and we could see a breather lot of questions about whether at the end of the Ma cycle it's been a pretty healthy one as we know I'm not willing to go as far as to say that I believe we're there yet, but this is.
BULL37|"Going to be very interesting fourth quarter."""
