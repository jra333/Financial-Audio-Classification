BULL0|"""It's great to have you."
NEUT1|I really wanted to talk about this call.
NEUT2|Why do you think the Treasury Secretary is going to matter that much?
BEAR3|Well, actually I'm not convinced that Janet Yellen is going to be good or bad for gold on herself.
NEUT4|I think that what we're talking about here is the alliance that Treasury is going to have.
NEUT5|What the Fed.
NEUT6|And so I think that when I brought up note to buy gold is 'cause I was going back to the last time we had a Treasury Secretary that also served previously as the head of the Fed.
NEUT7|And it was William Miller back in the in the late 1970s when we had the massive reflation.
NEUT8|An gold acted as a great.
NEUT9|Hedge against that, so it's really less about Janet Yellen.
NEUT10|It's might might even be more, frankly, Kelly about Jay Powell and the Fed.
NEUT11|And at some point, you know I've been in the deflation camp.
NEUT12|I've been in the big secular Bond Bull Camp, but you know, at some point we're going to reflate so much that we're going to get the inflation.
NEUT13|And that's really why you want to have gold in their portfolio.
NEUT14|Indeed, that's why I wanted to talk to you, in particular about this, because it is kind of a break from what we've heard from you in the past.
NEUT15|So, and this is really important and your daddy was on the halftime report a couple of weeks ago talking about the same phenomenon called AT fed.
NEUT16|But this combination of Treasury and the Fed and let's put aside all the independence questions and kind of focus on the real politik of it.
NEUT17|That combination you think I mean, are they going to overdo it?
NEUT18|Are they?
BEAR19|Are they going to overstimulate?
NEUT20|Well, I think that there's a risk that they already have, and I'm not even talking about the Treasury.
NEUT21|I'm talking about the Fed.
BULL22|I mean we have M1 growth Kelly of 56% year over year.
BULL23|M2 is running at 25% year over year and I think that we're now getting such dramatic rampant monetary creation that is going to overtake the contraction and money velocity.
NEUT24|I'm starting to for the first time in decades starting to second.
NEUT25|Guess my longstanding disinflation deflation view.
NEUT26|And I'm starting to think more about the future that we are going to overstimulate and we're going to get more information then it's broken for it's actually tell you the truth.
NEUT27|Look, it's more about the Fed and it was when Jay Powell said that we are going to leave rates at zero.
NEUT28|Forget about all the balance sheet expansion we rate to 0 even after inflation gets above our magical target.
BULL29|Elusive target of 2% long after we get to full employment or beyond, we're keeping rates to 0.
NEUT30|So the feds, they're telling you on their own and we're going to be keeping real rates negative.
NEUT31|For Lisa next, three or four minutes, ask you, Dave, 'cause I I just want to sneak this in before we have to go.
NEUT32|Why hasn't the bond market reacted yet?
NEUT33|Is it never going to react?
NEUT34|Is it just going to wait until it sees the actual inflation?
NEUT35|So you're talking about why hasn't the tenure broken above 1%?
NEUT36|Finally, that's what you're asking me.
BULL37|Well, look, we've already seen in the market's inflation expectations pick up from their lows, real rates or less negative than they were before.
NEUT38|But you see, it's gonna be very difficult Kelly to get a real bear market in bonds when the cost of carry is going to be close to zero.
NEUT39|It's like everything else in the markets.
NEUT40|There was no fed risk and there's no fed risk in the long end of the curve.
NEUT41|So that's why, like how steep is it really going to go so you don't get bear markets and bonds unless the Fed is raising the cost to carry and tightening policy so?
BEAR42|At worst, it's going to stay in a range for the foreseeable future.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
