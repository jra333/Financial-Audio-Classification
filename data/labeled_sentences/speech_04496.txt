BULL0|"""Welcome back to Bizarro."
NEUT1|Wall Street were bad news is good news, at least when it comes to economy.
BEAR2|This morning's jobless claims number came in disappointingly high.
BEAR3|That is terrible if you're looking for work, but it's fabulous for Wall Street because it means the Federal Reserve won't feel compelled to raise interest rates anytime soon.
NEUT4|She fed Chief Jay Pal wants to keep fighting unemployment rather than inflation, and this thought, so hard data makes it easier for him to stick to his guns and for growth stock buyers to come out the woodwork and by their face again.
NEUT5|And that's how the market could rally.
NEUT6|With the SP jumping 1.18% new all time, high gallivanting 172 points, and the NASDAQ were all those ones.
NEUT7|For alone, super growth stocks live.
BEAR8|Charge 1.76% now I know it sounds counterintuitive.
NEUT9|If you want higher stock prices, you need two things, though you need better than expected earnings.
BEAR10|And bad non inflationary news about the economy.
NEUT11|But I buy so that the Fed doesn't see the need to tighten.
BULL12|Today Jay Pal got a terrific excuse to keep easy money flowing.
NEUT13|And you know what?
BULL14|That's exactly what's needed after President Biden rolled out a massive $2.25 trillion jobs program yesterday, which brings us to our game plan.
NEUT15|Now tomorrow we get the Labor Department's monthly nonfarm payroll reporting.
NEUT16|Yeah, that they offer haven't slept with still do it now.
BEAR17|It might be softer than expected given today's sub optimal jobless claims.
NEUT18|Remember that's what kind of got people going the markets closed for Good Friday, but when we come in on Monday, we're going to be reacting.
NEUT19|Alright, we're going to be reacting to the number that comes out tomorrow 8:30 and once again, bad news is good news.
BEAR20|Wouldn't shock me if it's weaker than expected.
