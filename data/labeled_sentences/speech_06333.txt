NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal number.
BULL9|Same would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above 3140.
NEUT10|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3140.
BULL11|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step well, that area that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control of it.
NEUT17|Visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT18|Yeah, stand about 3140 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line.
NEUT19|The Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|Pretty straightforward in the near term.
NEUT21|It's all about this level.
NEUT22|Right up there at 3190 you can see that the price got rejected from that area several times, so I'm not saying that level camper broken.
NEUT23|Just saying that it's very clear that that's going to be an area that the price is going to bring it to a game if it's going to be able to push up through.
BULL24|And then if the price can push up through that level.
NEUT25|Next key area of resistance after that would then be up there right around the 3225 mark.
BULL26|But on all any angle you look at it, very impressive volume today.
BULL27|Very nice price movement.
NEUT28|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
