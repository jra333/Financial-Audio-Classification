NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from the."
BEAR1|Price it dropped a lot last night during your stream time it's dropped 3.17.
NEUT2|Very large job.
NEUT3|If we check the daily chart we can see.
NEUT4|The right cannot hear is already break and you look.
BEAR5|It's a lower low so it's still in the downtrend.
BEAR6|And if we checked the volume here we can see the volume is very huge compared to the other two days before.
BEAR7|So in my opinion is not a good sign for Apple.
BEAR8|It means somebody still selling the selling pressure is still high so it's not a bottom sign for this high volume.
NEUT9|So.
BEAR10|In my opinion it will fall further.
NEUT11|Where's the stop sign?
NEUT12|I think it's already touched the beginning of.
BEAR13|Of the uptrend from the early March, so it's very likely.
NEUT14|Apple will touch this level is the.
NEUT15|It's a 98, around 98.
NEUT16|Maybe find some support but now.
NEUT17|As these are large, a huge volume, so it's very unlikely it can stop here.
BULL18|"Thank you."""
