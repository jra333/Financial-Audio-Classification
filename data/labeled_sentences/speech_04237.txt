NEUT0|"""It's clear in this via video chart on ticker symbol IQ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will a pretty eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Although when the dust is settled I would consider it a victory of a day because it went sideways.
BEAR6|Now I realized that probably sounds pretty bad and it is.
BEAR7|I guess it is pretty bad if you're going to call a victory when the price just simply go sideways, but you have to.
NEUT8|You have to factor in the context here in the context here is that on Friday it was crazy.
BEAR9|There was just a whole lot of downward pressure going into.
NEUT10|The day, so to just have the price at least go sideways, is a step in the right direction.
NEUT11|Now does that mean this is for sure the bottom?
NEUT12|Does this mean that it's you know the prices for sure not going down any further.
NEUT13|No such thing as a for sure.
NEUT14|My point errors.
NEUT15|It's at least a valid.
NEUT16|It's at least a rational thought to have that you know what?
NEUT17|Maybe just maybe this is some sort of bottom that's forming, but again, not a guaranteed bottom, but at least makes sense now to start to question on whether or not this is some sort of bottom which brings about and makes that $16.00 mark.
NEUT18|Still very very important.
NEUT19|In fact, that is right where the price bounced off of it.
BULL20|From that last 30 minutes here, so good to see that $16.00 is holding strong, because then there's nothing fancy here.
NEUT21|If the price drops below 16 all of a sudden you have the price she having gone right back to where it was.
NEUT22|An price movements that go back to where they work, specially when you know where it was, was at Lowe's, not a sign of true power.
BEAR23|Not a sign of being any sort of bottom when all of a sudden the prices.
NEUT24|Like I said right back to where it was, but that didn't happen today that like I said, the price in fact bounced beautifully right off that $16.00 mark.
NEUT25|If there is going to be any sort of bigger recovery though, it's still all about these areas of resistance.
NEUT26|That first key area of resistance right here.
NEUT27|At the $18.15 ish mark, which is represented by that red line and the next level up there right around 1965, so continue to watch those areas of resistance.
NEUT28|But like I said, the best part about today, you know from the bullish side of things is the price just simply went sideways, which is suggesting that you know maybe the selling pressure is finally subsided enough for this that get some sort of bounce.
NEUT29|So let's see the next several days.
NEUT30|Play out First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
