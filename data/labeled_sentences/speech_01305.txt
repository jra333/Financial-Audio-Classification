NEUT0|"""Before I let you run, I have a question for you."
NEUT1|It's on Coca Cola.
BULL2|Yeah, big news today.
NEUT3|Ann Kelly in North Carolina wants to know if it's a buy.
NEUT4|What do you think?
BEAR5|It's down more than 7% and Pete, that's the worst day in in a decade after those earnings.
NEUT6|And I'm not very happy about it because I'm an older.
NEUT7|I've owned this stock for a little over a year, year and a half.
NEUT8|Something like that.
NEUT9|But you know, I've been able to sell calls against this position for a while.
NEUT10|I'm going to be buying back calls today.
BEAR11|I'm not happy about what they said though.
NEUT12|Scott, and the concern I have is when you start blaming it on things and you're not hearing the rest of the earnings calls.
BEAR13|Really blaming it on certain conditions in other places, that seems like an excuse so that does bother me.
NEUT14|But I like the stock.
NEUT15|I still think they have the organic growth that can maybe pull them out and there's the focuses of this new CEO has been.
NEUT16|Acquisition and moving away from the soda drinks.
NEUT17|It's not an easy thing to do, but it's something that Coke I think and execute well on, so I'm going to continue to hold the stock.
NEUT18|He will see it back here next week.
NEUT19|Alright, alright, have a great hearing from Minneapolis forced to answer some more questions now Jim, I got one for you Vince Boca Raton FL.
NEUT20|Thank you for the question Qualcomm.
NEUT21|You still own it.
NEUT22|Yep, and what do you think is a good entry point Vince?
NEUT23|This is a risky stock.
NEUT24|I like it right here.
NEUT25|I would add to it but you have to have an opinion on this FTC trial which is now in the judges hands awaiting a decision we don't know when.
BEAR26|If it is ruled against them against Qualcomm stock will go down to 40.
BULL27|If it comes in their favor, this sets up the table for a nice settlement with Apple.
NEUT28|It goes to 70 history, 20 years of history says that they will win, but it's not a guarantee.
NEUT29|All right.
NEUT30|Good stuff.
NEUT31|Thanks for the question again, Joe in New York is a question for Josh Broadcom Joe, what do you do with Broadcom right here?
BULL32|So, so yeah, I mean, this is one of the strongest stocks in the sector and in the overall market making new highs.
NEUT33|I really like the technical setup and it's cheap.
NEUT34|It's a forward PE of 12 in a sector that averages 15 so.
BEAR35|You've got 15% earnings growth here, according to the consensus as far as the eye can see, it's a mispriced.
NEUT36|Securities should be higher.
NEUT37|Alright?
NEUT38|Joey got one for you.
NEUT39|It's from Glen in Middlebrook, Virginia regions financial.
NEUT40|My 17 year old son, he says, has been researching regional banks interested in regions bank and Key Corp. Those two stocks made their high in March of 2018.
NEUT41|They have not been able to exceed it.
NEUT42|I got out of regions financial.
NEUT43|Two better banks I like independent and also TC by exposure to the Permian.
NEUT44|In Texas, all right, Jenny.
NEUT45|Lastly for you, Alan in Denver, Alan, thanks for the question Caterpillar.
NEUT46|What you think at so?
NEUT47|We own cat.
NEUT48|We love cat.
BULL49|We think that mining CapEx will be off of its lows.
BULL50|We think that the US construction remains stable.
BULL51|We think the interest rates continues to support demand and if we're right about China stimulus showing up later, that could be a little cherry on top.
BULL52|"Meanwhile, it's cheap at 11 times earnings."""
