NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see from this daily chart.
BULL2|Actually, Apple has successfully break out from the EMS and with a gap.
NEUT3|That means there's a price difference between the closing price of today and yesterday.
NEUT4|And here's another gap is 1 gap to gap.
BULL5|So actually after the three days jump Apple has successfully.
NEUT6|Break out from the double ship bottom.
NEUT7|That means this is a big W ship is 1 bottom to bottom and now for for Apple.
BULL8|Even though the volume is low, but it has breakout definitely.
NEUT9|So as long as Apple can keep above.
NEUT10|The EMS.
NEUT11|The MA line.
NEUT12|Then there will be possibility for.
BULL13|I put to go much higher from here and I think.
BULL14|The former top is not a problem because the double ship base is a very strong base for the supporting.
NEUT15|If they change the chart into weekly chart.
NEUT16|Then we can see it clearly.
NEUT17|Actually, here after the consolidation, because it the first time it touched here, the second time you touched here and waste.
NEUT18|Punks we can see.
NEUT19|The breakout is obviously.
NEUT20|The only concern is that the on the weekly chart the volume is not so strong, but sometimes when the volume is is low it means there are no much standing pressure, so it's still a valid breakout.
NEUT21|So in my opinion, after these two laws.
NEUT22|The Apple stock has found the low emitter, so it's very likely for Apple stock too.
NEUT23|Going higher from here and maybe much higher is very likely.
BULL24|"Thank you."""
