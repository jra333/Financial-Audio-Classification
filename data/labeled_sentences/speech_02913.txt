NEUT0|"""Hey guys, let's take a look at Facebook for August 13th."
NEUT1|It's already a little past the open but we can get a good indication of what the price action is and where the things headed.
NEUT2|Let's dive in.
BEAR3|Taking a look at the stocks this morning, most of the stocks are up pretty big because of the jobless claims.
BULL4|They were much lower than expected and then the whole market is pretty much benefiting from that.
NEUT5|So Facebook.
NEUT6|Just the same there.
NEUT7|There they have a big green candle here for the day starting off the day.
NEUT8|Pretty green.
NEUT9|Let's let's start with their resistance that they might have to breakthrough.
NEUT10|So one key one would be right here.
BEAR11|It kind of got rejected off it.
NEUT12|If you see it on the top of this candle, it got hit that resistance and bounce back a little bit.
NEUT13|Another one going forward.
NEUT14|Is Debbie here the 268 mark?
BULL15|See some support.
NEUT16|To support.
NEUT17|We can see.
NEUT18|Here.
NEUT19|At the top of this mark we about that.
NEUT20|Right there if you.
NEUT21|If you look here.
NEUT22|Mark is green.
NEUT23|It looks like it's going to trade in this kind of channel here for awhile.
BULL24|Maybe there might be another support here.
NEUT25|See like at the top of these candles and then come back here.
BULL26|There might be another support here, Facebook.
NEUT27|So those are pretty close together.
NEUT28|They might act about the same number, so we can expect to have it trained this channel.
BEAR29|Most of the other tech stocks have kind of broken out of these of their current trajectory, so we could potentially see the same thing here.
BEAR30|It's been kind of like on a downtrend the last couple of days.
NEUT31|This is mostly due to.
BULL32|Sector rotation earlier in the week yesterday there was some good movement upwards.
BEAR33|As you can see was the gap up.
NEUT34|And then here it kind of the same thing.
NEUT35|So it kind of trailed off today, so maybe we'll see the same thing, potentially with heading into Friday.
NEUT36|Another another big green candle to start the day.
NEUT37|So good luck and remember to like and subscribe for any more technical stock analysis.
NEUT38|"Also drop a comment for any specific stocks you want me to take a look at."""
