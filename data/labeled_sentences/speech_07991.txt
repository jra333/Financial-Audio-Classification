NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Katrina and I'm a social media manager here at The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|We're here to answer your investing questions and I've got a batch in from Facebook and Twitter.
NEUT2|I'm going to send them down to our analysts who answer them with their foolish opinions.
NEUT3|Moosighi from Twitter asks what are some stocks that have a long history of paying dividends?
NEUT4|Companies with a long history of paying dividends to shareholders are in pretty rare company.
NEUT5|I'll give you 3 examples of some longstanding dividend payers.
BEAR6|Abbott Labs has been paying a dividend.
BULL7|Every year since 1924, it's increased its dividend every year for the last 40 years and right now it yields about 3.4% as of last check, 3M has been paying a dividend every year since 1916, and it's increased that dividend for 54 straight years.
NEUT8|It's yielding about 2.8% right now, and finally, Procter and Gamble has been paying a dividend every year for 122 straight years.
BULL9|It's increase that dividend for 56 straight years.
NEUT10|And it yields right now, about 3.6%.
BULL11|So it's a great picture of consistency and willingness to give cash back to shareholders and reward shareholders along the way.
NEUT12|Remember, dividends used to be the primary point of investing in the stock market up until about middle of the 20th century, and we've really gotten away from that.
BULL13|It's nice to see companies are sticking to those routes now.
NEUT14|Those companies aren't the highest yielders on the market.
NEUT15|They don't yield more than 4% in all three examples.
BULL16|They do yield more than the 10 year Treasury, which is a good sign.
NEUT17|But several companies that you probably have heard of pay more to shareholders every year.
NEUT18|Altria is a good one.
NEUT19|AT&T, Verizon.
NEUT20|They all pay pretty nice yields to their shareholders, and the thing that you want to pay attention to in any dividend stock.
NEUT21|A high yield stock or a very consistently rewarding stock is the payout ratio.
NEUT22|That ratio is simply dividends per share divided by earnings per share, and it's a measure of.
NEUT23|The sustainability of the dividend you want to make sure that the company is earning enough in profits to cover the payout of the dividend.
NEUT24|You could take that one notch further and go to the free cash flow payout ratio, which I actually prefer.
NEUT25|It simply dividends per share divided by free cash flow per share, and again, it's making sure that the company has enough cash to pay out that dividend because what you want to learn about a dividend stock is not just the yield, it's how sustainable the yield is, so you can earn it and reinvest it and take the cash if you need to over the long term.
BULL26|For a free cash flow payout ratio, you want to look for something maybe 80% or less is a good is a good benchmark, but it's a good place to be in dividend stocks are gaining in popularity now that it's hard to find yield in other parts of the market.
