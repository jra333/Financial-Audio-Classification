NEUT0|"""Investors are looking forward to this triple Witching Day tomorrow and Thursday, including the comedy testimony."
NEUT1|Do you do nothing?
NEUT2|Do you try to anticipate it?
NEUT3|Do you try to hedge?
NEUT4|What do you do?
NEUT5|Yeah, I wouldn't try to anticipate it.
NEUT6|We don't know there's a lot of goings on in Washington and a lot of ups and downs, but I think looking through that looking to the, you know, the fundamentals.
BEAR7|I think coming out of the election, people got too carried away about what we might get that grandioso reforms and all that people have scaled that back dramatically.
NEUT8|I think appropriately so, but I think there's a danger that.
BEAR9|People may get the pendulum swung too far and people may be discounting any possibility of reform.
NEUT10|I agree there is still a better than even chance that we get something before the end of the year, much scaled down from the, you know, the big hopes and plans, but something and I think the reason is, Republicans will in Congress will say if we don't do anything, we're in a lot of trouble in the midterm elections.
NEUT11|Well, that's what Tom Barrack said.
NEUT12|They agree with the hunger's.
NEUT13|Gotta do something but will you be watching tomorrow?
NEUT14|The comedy testimony?
NEUT15|If so, will it be just for the prurient interest in it?
NEUT16|Or actually 'cause you think it might affect somebody's?
NEUT17|Value it would affect somebody's value of some of the testimony comes out and what it means is that it would put the Trump administration and the bad picture.
BEAR18|But you get these feelings of derailment of the Trump agenda.
NEUT19|That's where the tail risk is for the markets.
NEUT20|So if you look at this Trump trade as we call it, and you just take the SNP, the 10 year and the dollar is now older Virgin as well, going to different direction.
NEUT21|So echo Josh comments like there's some hope still in the market in the stock market.
BEAR22|But bonds and the dollar have the opposite, their pessimistic.
NEUT23|So this testimony tomorrow's.
NEUT24|Importance where's the biggest Miss price Josh?
NEUT25|What do you think?
BEAR26|I think you know, maybe bond yields have gotten a little too pessimistic about things you know.
BULL27|So I think we could see some some backup and yields gradual and modest.
NEUT28|I don't think we're going back.
NEUT29|"You know all the way maybe to where we were post post election, but I think a little bit because that."""
