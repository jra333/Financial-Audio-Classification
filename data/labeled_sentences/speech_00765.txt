NEUT0|"""Jim, your tweet off with Elon Musk continues."
NEUT1|It started last week when you compared him to PT Barnum, saying he should be called PT Musk for creating an exciting but three ring circus that cotton Musk attention, leading him to tweet.
NEUT2|Kramer is a simulation he's not real.
NEUT3|On Friday, David attempted to show that you are in fact a real something.
NEUT4|You continue during your live show with the street, right?
NEUT5|But must continues this morning tweeting.
NEUT6|Where's the proof, right?
NEUT7|So I've just said that the proof is elusive.
NEUT8|I like this is the new post Friday Musk where he's not allowed to talk about 500,000 cars being sold.
NEUT9|So why not have circus?
NEUT10|Must chemists be a little bit more congenial, less combat if and if I am the source of them, could log in.
NEUT11|Do I love the guy?
NEUT12|How can you not?
NEUT13|But he's created.
NEUT14|I just wanted him to stop hyping.
NEUT15|So if I'm the free Fire Zone, so be it.
NEUT16|Fire away Mr Musk.
NEUT17|He does tweet this morning a picture of starships on Mars by rendering of rockets that people are taking back and forth.
NEUT18|Maybe that's where his attention turns.
NEUT19|I think he's a big thinker there.
NEUT20|For everybody else, I believe is regarded as a small thing.
NEUT21|My initial dispute with him had to do with the idea that there would be a solar field in Northwest Colorado that would create all the energy in the in the country, and I question that, and that's really where I became a simulation.
NEUT22|I was, I said, listen bookmark electric power Dominion.
NEUT23|I have all these different power companies.
NEUT24|And that's when he said, you know, there's a 50% chance your simulation.
NEUT25|So now it's up to me to prove that it's really no.
NEUT26|It's 100 and some human, but it's loose, and it sounds like I waited.
NEUT27|Get a person to person interview, right?
NEUT28|"So he couldn't look I. I think the world over."""
