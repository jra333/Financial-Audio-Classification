NEUT0|"""Hi and welcome to this blooper Markets video update with me."
NEUT1|John Kibler, head currency analyst.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to look at Dollar CAD as prices broken.
BEAR3|31.3 now this is a key level that we spoke about in the Forex market outlook as well as a 4X video last week and we spoke about the fact that Dollar Cat are 1.3 could continue to bright lower.
NEUT4|If the US oil market.
BULL5|Continues to climb so we can see here that WTI is broken above those $44 highs and continued to break to the upside.
NEUT6|If we just look at this sort of four hour time frame on oil at the moment.
BULL7|We've got the market forming a bit of a consolidation pattern after I rally up, so if we look left we can see the market rallied up from these sort of $38.00 level rallied up into the $46.
BULL8|And now we're starting to get a bit of consolidation, so that's showing us that.
BEAR9|The market may still be preparing for another move to the upside here may even come back down and retest that $44 before seen another rally up.
BULL10|And if that's the case, then I expect dollar CAD to continue to push to the downside now is looking at the monthly timeframe and we can see that around about 128 is a decent level on Dollar CAD.
BEAR11|There's another noise low formed in 2018 and a high back in 2014, which the market has reacted from this level quite nicely from and looking at the monthly.
NEUT12|You know we're at the end of the month.
BULL13|Now we can see how bearish this candle stick is, which suggests to me that we could see some further downside as well so.
BULL14|Going into the daily time frame with that trend is looking pretty decent.
BEAR15|We've got this market making lower lows and lower highs currently.
NEUT16|So what I'd like to see is a bit of a pullback, and if we get a pullback, maybe into that 1.3 level we could look for further shorting opportunities and one time frame I'm really going to keep an eye on.
BULL17|Is this four hour, 4 hour continues to make lower highs and lower lows, and it's going to be good for further shorten opportunities.
BULL18|And we have some slight resistance up around about one 2980, so if we were to get the market pulling back.
NEUT19|Into this level and we were to see some bearish price action.
NEUT20|We could assume that the market.
BULL21|He's finding resistance here and that we could expect the overall trend to continue my share rally up into 1.3.
BEAR22|I'm expecting rejection of that for a continuation to the downside, so dollar CAD looking really, really good for further shorten opportunities.
NEUT23|"Looking to see if we can get this into 1.28 as targets that's watching this video today and I'll speak to you soon."""
