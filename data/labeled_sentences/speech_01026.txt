NEUT0|"""Let's talk about Berkshire Hathaway's bet on gold."
NEUT1|In a move antithetical to Warren Buffett's criticism of the magical metal, Berkshire acquired nearly 21 million shares of Barrick Gold Guys.
NEUT2|Now this is only $600 million.
NEUT3|This is like a quarter percent of the portfolio.
BULL4|Barrick Gold, though.
NEUT5|I mean, the investors there don't care.
NEUT6|The shares are up over 11% today, but down, let's talk about what's really going on.
NEUT7|There's no way this was.
NEUT8|Warren Buffett himself buying right.
NEUT9|There's no way the conventional wisdom and folks I talked to that are more familiar with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway than I am.
NEUT10|All say that this is not likely something that Buffett put into play himself.
NEUT11|This might very well be tall.
NEUT12|Combs or Ted Weschler.
NEUT13|The two guys that he is put in charge of the overall Berkshire portfolio.
NEUT14|We know that Warren Buffett in the past has taken the more active role in Mega Mega Huge deals, multi multi billion dollar transactions, large stakes in mega cap companies, Barrick Gold.
BULL15|This is an interesting move here only because we've seen the fruits of their labor.
BEAR16|I mean these gold mining stocks have surged in this time, being because the covid pandemic and fears about inflation that put a real tailwind to that.
NEUT17|It's just very interesting that this Barrick Gold trade is now taken.
NEUT18|Every other gold miner up along with it anything would add to that Robert.
NEUT19|Yeah, I would just say let's not confuse the company with the commodity.
NEUT20|It's everyone saying what suddenly Buffett loves gold.
NEUT21|He hates gold.
NEUT22|Well he's buying the company and let's remember it fits a lot of his criteria.
NEUT23|It generates a huge amount of income.
NEUT24|$4 billion last year.
NEUT25|This year over $700 million.
BULL26|It's 11 times earnings, so it's fairly cheap and it pays a good dividend.
NEUT27|So as a company it fits the buffet standards.
NEUT28|And let's not confuse it with actual physical gold, which he is rightly said.
NEUT29|It doesn't make sense for Berkshire.
NEUT30|So that's fair.
NEUT31|It's just that these companies have been around forever.
NEUT32|Does he think now is the value 8 whatever?
NEUT33|That's a very, very good point.
NEUT34|I will reserve a great.
NEUT35|I'll take it with a grain of salt.
BEAR36|"It just is a very head scratching move today."""
