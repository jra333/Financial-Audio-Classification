NEUT12|Alright, Next up we have a S&P global SPG stock symbol, most recent upgrade.
NEUT13|This is video #8 of 19 of the upgraded stack series to watch from the beginning click on the link in the description below.
NEUT14|Now SPG, I let's take a look.
NEUT15|First and foremost.
NEUT16|The price target on this is 402.
NEUT17|I can get a price target marker in their 402.
NEUT18|Yahoo Price target on this is 401, so about the same about the same by target on this is 320 to 340 and we're going to get into that in just a moment.
NEUT19|We've got bullish signals all over the place on this SP Global, together with its subsidiaries, they provide ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodities markets worldwide.
NEUT20|They opposite operate through four segments.
NEUT21|S&P Global ratings, SMP Global Market Intelligence as simply global Platts, S&P Dow Jones indices.
NEUT22|Now they are making money earning 9.6, six, $9.60.
NEUT23|$0.66 per share.
NEUT24|PE ratio.
BULL25|37 very strong.
NEUT26|Taking a look at the fundamentals on a long term scale.
BULL27|This is a beautiful upward trend.
NEUT28|This is covid right here.
BULL29|Look at the little bit of a short term they've been doing well.
BULL30|They've been doing well, very pattern trading stock.
NEUT31|You can see it's kind of at the high end of its pattern.
BEAR32|I'd be looking for a pullback here for a buy target 3:20 to 3:40.
BULL33|We've got a very strong support here at 3:20.
BULL34|Now that's asking for quite a hell of a pullback, so I think.
NEUT35|To be generous, you want to start buying a right about 344, but but look for a decent pullback to get in.
NEUT36|We do see the stack does make some pretty generous pullbacks, and again it is at the top end of that spectrum, so one to watch for a pullback and get in.
BULL37|I like it though I think a nice strong target of 402 forty points gained from here is approximately 10%.
NEUT38|So we like that.
NEUT39|"We'll see on the next one."""
