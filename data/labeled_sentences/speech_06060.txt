NEUT0|"""Well, the rocket ship is emblematic at least of the SpaceX launch the other day."
NEUT1|Is it going to tell us about the economy?
NEUT2|Look, I think we need to think about where we are in the cycle.
NEUT3|When we analyze the economic data.
BEAR4|So yes, right now we are bouncing off the bottom and today's jobs report was a blowout.
BEAR5|It was much longer than anticipated.
BEAR6|You know, the consensus was looking for a decline and we clearly thought increase here, but I think in general what the data is showing us right now is that there's a balance.
BULL7|And in the early stage of the recovery, it's going to look quite V shaped because we're going from an economy that was closed to lock down to hibernating to one that is back.
NEUT8|Open, but the bigger question is then I think we're there.
NEUT9|Still not necessarily an answer is what happens after you exhaust that big initial balance?
NEUT10|What happens after you have that easy growth?
NEUT11|Then you have to think about the longer recovery, and that's where you have to consider the scars that are left on the economy as a result of this unprecedented shock.
NEUT12|Yeah, Lindsay.
NEUT13|What is your estimate now for GDP in the second quarter and in the back half of the year?
NEUT14|Well, I don't think this change is actually much the longer term thesis for the economy.
BULL15|We knew that some jobs were going to come back.
BEAR16|The bigger question is how many jobs are going to remain lossed?
BEAR17|We know that there's been a tremendous amount of businesses that have closed permanently, and even those that are now being able to bridge the gap of the last three months there anxious to reopen face a new environment of different rules and restrictions.
BEAR18|That's going to greatly limit their activity, and by extension, the need for additional rehire.
NEUT19|So this is simply the first wave and really reflects.
NEUT20|Primarily the baseline bare minimum.
NEUT21|If you will need it in terms of reopening the economy at this reduced capacity, but it remains to be seen about whether or not this is in fact an on going positive theme.
BEAR22|So we're still waiting for the brunt of the weakness to be felt in the second quarter, with GDP likely down 30%, maybe more.
BULL23|Now we could continue to see somewhat of a mild rebound in the third quarter in a positive realm of eight to 10% by the end of the year.
NEUT24|It's likely we fall back into.
BEAR25|"Negative territory amid still restrained business activity, as well as the consumer, which is likely to remain hesitant to go back into the marketplace in any capacity relative to what we saw prior to the pandemic because of both lingering health and financial concerns."""
