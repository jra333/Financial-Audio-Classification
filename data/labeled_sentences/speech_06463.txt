NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for August 1st, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm Celina necklace technical analyst that exam.com and today will look at the dollar yen on the daily chart so USD JPY is shifted its outlook from your neutral bias to more bearish one after Friday's big tumble back below.
NEUT2|The key 105 level.
BEAR3|Or you saw prices fall through key levels of 104103.
BEAR4|An even below 102.
BEAR5|The market appears to have stabilized just above the 102 yen level today on Monday, with Arsi falling below 50 still remaining in bearish territory.
BEAR6|There is scope for further downside, though.
NEUT7|The next target would come in other fibbonaci level, the 78.6 retracement of the up leg from 99.98 to 107.48.
NEUT8|So this level comes in at.
BEAR9|101.57 and then a deeper decline would see a retest of the July 8 low at 99.98 so only a move back above the 104 yen level would weaken the bearish few and bring the market back to neutral.
NEUT10|But for now it appears the top is in place at 107.48.
NEUT11|After the corrective upside move an if we if we look at the bigger picture, we can see that.
BEAR12|The Dolly and pear is in a downtrend within a falling channel, so the outlook still remains quite bearish.
BULL13|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
