NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take like the Apple stock we can see here on the daily chart."
BEAR1|Apple has made a red candle and, uh, this one has a 2.73 drop.
NEUT2|It's a huge job, but if we check the chart clearly and carefully, we can see here.
NEUT3|Actually, the red candle is still in the inside of the.
BULL4|Green candle and also we can see it has made a new high.
NEUT5|Actually we can see here the right cannot has a new high is higher than the green candle, but the law is higher than the law of the green candle.
NEUT6|So it means it's a higher high and higher low.
BULL7|So it's still a positive sign for Apple.
NEUT8|And also we can see here.
NEUT9|Here's a tail under this candle, so it means there's support for the stock.
NEUT10|So if we check, the volume is also very noticeable that the volume is huge and volume is nearly equal to the volume before.
NEUT11|So as we can see here.
BULL12|There's somebody selling but as well, there's somebody buying, so it means, in my opinion, the stock will still go higher from here because we can see is that the momentum is strong, the volume is high and the higher low and higher high with the support underneath.
BULL13|So in my opinion, Apple stock will go higher from here.
BULL14|"Thank you."""
