NEUT0|"""Why would anyone want to buy an asset that they knew would lose money?"
NEUT1|Like any fixed interest rate asset, when you buy a bond, if you pay a higher price for it, you get less back in terms of yield.
NEUT2|Now you'll just refers to the interest rate that a lender gets in return for lending money.
NEUT3|So just remember, the higher the price, the lower the yield.
NEUT4|The two have an inverse relationship.
NEUT5|Now this chart is looking at the yield on the German 10 year government bond, which they call the Boondh.
BEAR6|Now, as you can see, the yield on the boondh has been declining and declining so much lately that it's actually gone into negative territory.
BEAR7|Anne, it's trading right now between negative 0.2 and negative zero point 3%.
BEAR8|This happened for the first time back in 2016, but we're actually at a lower rate now than we were back then.
NEUT9|What this means essentially is that people are paying such a high price for these German boons that they know that they're paying for more than they're going to get back.
NEUT10|Why would anyone do this?
NEUT11|They're paying for the privilege of losing money.
NEUT12|Why wouldn't you just hold on to it?
NEUT13|Well, let's start by talking about European banks.
NEUT14|The ECB charges European banks 0.4% to hold their money in deposits.
BEAR15|Negative 0.4% is actually much worse than negative 0.2 or negative zero point.
NEUT16|3%.
NEUT17|From the bank's perspective, so they'd much rather put it in these boons then with the ECB.
NEUT18|And this is actually by design.
NEUT19|The ECB wants banks to invest their capital out into the economy rather than just sitting on the cash.
NEUT20|Now here's a second reason that some investors might want to buy these bones.
NEUT21|It's because they're safe and their liquid.
BULL22|So the German government is considered a reliable borrower, making their bonds safe.
BEAR23|They also can be traded on the secondary market relatively quickly, which makes them liquid if the Arizona economy goes down, then assets like equity or corporate debt, they're going to perform much worse than these German boons will.
NEUT24|So even though there's negative yield, it's a price investors are willing to pay for that safety and liquidity.
NEUT25|Now, here's a third reason why someone might want to buy.
BEAR26|These negative yielding boons.
BULL27|The ECB has recently signaled that it may want to buy more sovereign debt that would push up the price of these German boons.
NEUT28|So if you're an investor and you think the price of something is going to go up in the future, you may buy it now so that you can sell it later, making yourself a little profit.
NEUT29|So these are just some of the reasons why people may want to buy German boons, even though they have a negative yield, but it's not all of the reasons in general.
NEUT30|It's important to know that even though it's on its surface, it may seem silly to buy negative yielding asset.
NEUT31|"There are some reasons why it actually makes sense, even though right now it essentially looks like a guaranteed loss."""
