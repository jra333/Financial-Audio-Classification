NEUT0|"""Carlyle Group trying to take their company public priced to sell Dennis Berman."
NEUT1|The uptalk what do you mean, the uptight?
NEUT2|This is well, I think that's, you know, I gotta make this exciting for people.
BULL3|OK, good.
NEUT4|I don't know how many people out there excited that David Rubenstein's trying to get even richer by selling his shares in the Carla Group.
NEUT5|Well, that's not so if you think about Fahrenheit 911, the Michael Moore movie, Carlisle, is this really sort of?
NEUT6|Dark, shadowy character.
NEUT7|In that movie you know they've employed all these former presidents they've captured by Bernardo Frank Carlucci.
NEUT8|Their bond.
NEUT9|All these defense businesses, but slowly, somehow, they've been able to change how they do business and changing their perceived.
NEUT10|And they're going public.
NEUT11|I think.
NEUT12|Probably today if they actually get it.
NEUT13|People buy shares in these kinds of private equity companies.
BEAR14|The Blackstone IPO did not do well.
NEUT15|The KKR important that we have a graph.
NEUT16|Yeah, they were.
BEAR17|They all die so did not do well.
NEUT18|They all.
BEAR19|They all did terribly well.
NEUT20|You would think perhaps, you know, at the bottom I didn't realize that.
NEUT21|Actress, I mean these things, it's you know it's the old.
NEUT22|If these guys are the smartest guys on Wall Street and they're selling, why in the world do you buying?
NEUT23|Well maybe you want to buy it when it hits?
NEUT24|You know somewhere but you know somewhere 5040% below you, but you can't.
NEUT25|You know, it's impossible to figure out which was very difficult.
NEUT26|Of course, is that these businesses, they they kind of a lot of their buyout money comes in chunks, right?
NEUT27|It's not such a predictable revenue business, and that just puts them at a discount.
NEUT28|You know, when there's an illiquidity, another?
NEUT29|Is there a private equity business left?
NEUT30|Dennis Berman, Europe of you know, you know you were reporting on private equity guys back in 0405 or six when there was like a huge business.
BEAR31|Yep, is gone, isn't it?
NEUT32|It's not totally gone, but it's not.
NEUT33|It's not there at scale.
BULL34|You know, KKR was able to move five six $7 billion of equity in given DL, say TXU.
NEUT35|The biggest deal in history, which is probably going to be the biggest flameout in history.
NEUT36|But when it comes to Carlisle, you sort of like what why, why 'cause you David Rubenstein want some money.
NEUT37|Pocket, that's why isn't that?
NEUT38|Why now exactly so caveat emptor right now.
NEUT39|So this is not about giving investors a good opportunity.
NEUT40|This is about people needing an opportunity to liquefy their very illiquid steaks and you are, as an individual stockholder, you are an answer to David Rubenstein's personal wealth problem, not a capital need for the business.
NEUT41|Will it get done tonight?
NEUT42|It's because it's it's only value is that there is a public float, and so if I'm a buyer, I'm I'm telling the dealer, yeah, I'll pay, but I'll pay right, much lower.
NEUT43|"Dennis Berman."""
