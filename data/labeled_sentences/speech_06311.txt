NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL2|Wala very eventful day on this one.
NEUT3|I mean price truly all over the place started all the way down there went all the way up there.
BULL4|Very impressive bounce then a rollback over here.
NEUT5|But upon rolling back over has now made a couple of levels here that a lot of people are going to be watching so I don't want any of this to come across like I'm trying to make it seem like I have some sort of special abilities or special talents.
NEUT6|Nothing like that.
NEUT7|I assure you that people that use charts and understand charts are going to be watching these levels and I bring all that up because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT8|Call a cell phone prophecy caught whatever you want.
NEUT9|It can definitely produce some very dynamic price movements, and that's what we have here in regards to this area of support.
NEUT10|At let's see what is that 3095 thirty 95 being one of those levels that you're going to have all sorts of shorts watching that level, and rightfully so.
NEUT11|While nothing is guaranteed.
NEUT12|My core point here is that if the price were to come down here, behave in that manner.
BEAR13|An break to the downside that break in and of itself could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT14|Not guaranteed to happen, but certainly not some sort of random thought.
NEUT15|I mean, there's definitely a lot of people are going to be watching that, and you know, maybe people just sell for the sake of selling, because again, called a cellphone prophecy.
NEUT16|Whatever you want to call it.
NEUT17|That is definitely going to be a very very watched level, and if that level of 3095 is broken.
BEAR18|Then I don't think I would be shocked to see the price potentially drift down there and test 3075 if not even lower than that.
NEUT19|So 3095 thirty 75 going to be those two near term of support.
NEUT20|But to be fair, maybe the price doesn't break up with you know below those levels.
NEUT21|Maybe the price starts to turn itself around and if that were to occur then the main level of resistance to watch moving forward is all about that purple line up there.
NEUT22|The 50.
NEUT23|Moving average currently valid, it will just call it 3135 so will keep a close eye on that.
NEUT24|If there is any sort of attempted balances.
NEUT25|But at least in my opinion the main dynamic and the very.
NEUT26|Possible dynamic to watch moving forward is is that 39 or 3095 mark eventually going to fail?
NEUT27|Let's see what happens with it on Friday 1st off.
BULL28|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT30|But it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you.
NEUT39|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live.
