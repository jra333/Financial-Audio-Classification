BEAR0|"""Yes, I am seeing sore squeezes all over the place."
NEUT1|In many cases, they're actually being orchestrated by motivated young stock buyers who are explicitly trying to crush the shorts using websites that frankly are a lot of fun, but I think are encouraging people to do something that I hope they continue to make money, one they may not.
NEUT2|Then that brings me to GameStop the troubled video game retailer.
NEUT3|For years, this stock has been absolutely hated because the whole industry is moving online, so shorting game stock had been like shooting fish in a barrel.
NEUT4|But then two things happened.
NEUT5|First, a highly acclaimed activist investor, Ryan Cohen, joined the board of directors that could track record he's the guy who founded Chewy, the phenomenally successful online pet food retailers.
NEUT6|2nd and more important, the new PlayStation and Xbox launched, and you can't find them anywhere.
NEUT7|There's so much demand.
BEAR8|Suddenly the short sellers who made so much money in this stock we're on the run.
NEUT9|Remember what I said?
NEUT10|There were too many people in shorter other banks, so I ended up.
NEUT11|Then I ended up getting bored in right now.
BEAR12|An astounding 144% of GameStop shares have been sold short.
NEUT13|That's far more than there is.
NEUT14|That's not right.
NEUT15|It's shares can't be bored when you can't find shares to borrow.
BULL16|Your broker will closeout your short position, which is how something like GameStop could tack 127% today.
NEUT17|The thing is, this is not a regular short squeeze.
BULL18|We have a ton of enthusiastic young buyers in this market.
NEUT19|They love to get behind stocks and put all the social media sites with recommendations.
NEUT20|Think Wall Street bets on Reddit, the popular online information site right now.
NEUT21|If you go to those sites, and I encourage you to take a look at this, they're populated mostly by younger readers and participants.
NEUT22|Who had plainly openly plotting to blow up the shorts, in this case by buying game stock at any price and bidding the stock up up and up to crush the short so they have to cover.
NEUT23|Get it taken up.
NEUT24|It's incredible to watch.
BULL25|I think they're succeeding beyond their wildest dreams back in order.
NEUT26|GameStop.
NEUT27|Trade it for then it went to 15 when the new consoles launched and we realized video games have a great holiday season.
NEUT28|Then it jumped to $20 when the active is joining the board with and then Simpson the buyers have hit the stock message boards.
BEAR29|An urge to gang tackle of the shorts.
BULL30|GameStop has now doubled in two days now with the stock just under $40.
NEUT31|Management should issue shares to pay down debt, change their fortunes.
NEUT32|This is the perfect time to fundraise.
NEUT33|I called him to ask him why they aren't doing it.
NEUT34|Got no response.
NEUT35|The short squeeze would make it so easy.
NEUT36|Although you could argue maybe it's not ethical, it would make it easy.
NEUT37|Oh, it's not just GameStop, there's a whole new world of stock shortage after the jump, parent of Taco Bell, KFC Pizza Hut they announced they're partnering with the heavily shorted beyond me.
NEUT38|So the stock jumps 13% just like that.
NEUT39|Or how about beyond bed Bath and beyond BBBY that's the stock you know I like I like it very much after doing nothing for ages.
NEUT40|This talk is caught.
BULL41|Fire jumping almost 90% two day.
NEUT42|Why?
NEUT43|Well a poster on Reddit.
NEUT44|Wallstreetbets wrote a piece titled The BBBY Short Squeeze starts Now then you gave you some rocket ship emojis of course.
BEAR45|Then quote earnings were not a disaster and BBBY is about to burn all caps.
NEUT46|The Shorters went buybacks.
NEUT47|Others quickly join him, of course, but best in buying stocks for ages, I mean, this is just another short social media orchestrated short squeeze, just like I saw in GameStop, because 67% of bed Bass shares have been sold short.
NEUT48|Oh boy, that makes them short sellers, easy pickings.
