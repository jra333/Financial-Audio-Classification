NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video Chardan ticker symbol UMC."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action POV, but you look down here at the volume.
NEUT5|An very nice way to start off the new week.
NEUT6|So a lot of eyeballs going to be watching this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first area of support is what I would call the ideal number cycling.
NEUT9|What makes this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT10|Could say up there above $3.70 now.
NEUT11|Don't get me wrong.
BEAR12|If the price falls below that level, it does not mean the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but if the price could manage the above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT17|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT18|So very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT19|That right there is hard to find in quote unquote.
NEUT20|The move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT22|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT23|As line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls run full control.
NEUT24|You must visualize that.
NEUT25|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT26|Yeah, stand above that level would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the sharp as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Main Level Watch nothing fancy or complicated here, just simply worded the party finally stopped today and that was right up there at $4.10, so 410 will be Public Enemy number one, but really, resistance levels don't matter.
NEUT28|What do I mean by that?
NEUT29|What matters the most is what the price already been doing and that's this right here.
NEUT30|As long as the price keeps on chipping away in building these higher bases, or if you want envision these stair steps.
NEUT31|So as long as it stares up, continuing the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will.
NEUT32|Once you take care of itself, including breaking areas of resistance.
NEUT33|So focus on how the consolidation.
NEUT34|Focus on just chipping away and building those higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT35|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT36|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL39|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up.
