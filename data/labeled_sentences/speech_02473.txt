BULL0|"""Alright, Disney is at $178.69 with a market cap of 323.52 billion and we're staying steady at this new level."
NEUT1|I think.
NEUT2|I think the days of one 30s and one 40s are dead unless something seriously happens with the pandemic.
NEUT3|But right now Disney is just I don't know.
NEUT4|I'm not gonna tear.
NEUT5|They're not slowing down.
BULL6|Things are just looking better and better.
NEUT7|And in today's news.
BULL8|Disney stock gets an upgrade as former Bear says his call was dead wrong.
NEUT9|So.
BULL10|Light shed partners analyst Richard Green upgraded Disney stock to neutral from sell on Friday, writing that the company is making strong strides in streaming that position.
NEUT11|The company.
BEAR12|As the only media company that is capable of competing with Netflix and the tech Giants, so he downgraded his or downgraded his view on Disney due to the pandemic and he gave it a sell.
NEUT13|'cause obviously it was focused hurting due to the parks and now he's changing it from neutral.
NEUT14|Frankly I think this is kind of a BS article, I mean.
NEUT15|How are you going to?
NEUT16|How are you going to say Disney is at a neutral by right now when they have read that they've shifted their gears to focus on their streaming platform, 'cause they know the parks are?
BEAR17|Affected due to this whole pandemic like nobody ever thought this would happen.
BEAR18|It's happen they realized they're going to lose billions and billions of dollars and it's not a good sign, so they kind of need to diversify and they have and they are just killing it too.
NEUT19|If you watch my videos before.
NEUT20|You'll see that I've always talked about them in the 100 to $130 range, and I've always had faith in Disney, I think.
BULL21|I think it is definitely a buy in my opinion.
NEUT22|Obviously I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT23|But just look at the facts.
NEUT24|Look at look at the data.
BEAR25|Look at how much it's gone up.
NEUT26|Look at how much they're investing in Disney.
NEUT27|Plus look at how much they earn investing in Hotstar an getting their streaming to potentially have what I think they the last time I saw this, they were going to hit like 250,000,000 or 350,000,000.
NEUT28|That's insane numbers, so please stay on top of this kind of stuff.
BULL29|It's great that we got upgraded.
NEUT30|I think he's kind of being a little.
NEUT31|Too reserved on his opinion, but you know that's his opinion.
NEUT32|I just want you to be aware that upgrades are happening.
NEUT33|Even just to upgrade from a sell to a neutral is big in the finance world when analysts are doing that, that's that's a good sign.
NEUT34|That means that Disney is doing something right there, making money, and you know what.
NEUT35|Stay on top of it.
NEUT36|Do your own research.
NEUT37|Have some fun, make some money.
