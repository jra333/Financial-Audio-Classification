BEAR0|"""The estimates are that about half the 2.7 to $3 trillion, or accumulated profits."
NEUT1|That's past profits that come that have been stockpiling.
NEUT2|About half of that was reinvested into property, factories, equipment, vehicles, stuff that isn't really going to come back to the US anytime soon, not in any kind of meaningful liquid securities that are easy to are there long term illiquid securities as well, or not really.
NEUT3|It's not so much long term illiquid security the rest of it is mostly either Cash Cash equivalents or marketable securities, so stuff that companies could sell an you know if they wanted to.
NEUT4|Could sell and turn into cash or reinvest.
NEUT5|Also is I mean it?
NEUT6|Like I said, it is still somewhat early.
NEUT7|Is there uncertainty in CEOs minds about about either how to do it or whether it's going to be?
NEUT8|It's not going to be grandfathered or what's in there thinking that's causing them to hesitate to bring it back.
NEUT9|Well, so one of the things is that the regulations aren't done yet, and so companies know what they're going to have to pay on this one time transition tax.
NEUT10|That's a tax on all their profits, whether or not their repatriated, all those accumulated profits.
NEUT11|But they don't know exactly what the ends and outs of those rules are going to be, so depending what those rules are, they may want to, you know, not move money out of 1 country or another, and they may want to wait to reallocate it.
NEUT12|So I did hear a little bit issue if there, if they haven't even written the rules on it yet, but there are some rules they're getting some guidance there, but the gist of it is that for the most part, companies aren't going to move money until they need it, so you have a company like United Technologies there pursuing an acquisition.
NEUT13|Guess what they are in fact moving.
BULL14|Some they have moved some billions of dollars back because it's cheaper than borrowing even at today's low rates.
NEUT15|Well, it's hard to.
NEUT16|Even if it's a dollar, it's hard to look at it and say we wish you know.
BULL17|I mean, obviously we want it to be more, but anything is better than the previous where we were and certainly repatriations are up.
NEUT18|There's no question about that, and it was at a record.
NEUT19|Or was it just above 2017?
NEUT20|It's certainly the amount that was repatriated in the first quarter, according to Commerce.
NEUT21|How much above the first quarter it was, it was more than the first quarter was more than what you saw in 2016 and 2017, How much more to combine?
BULL22|Combine, combine, so there's definitely a lot of money coming back.
NEUT23|It's about.
NEUT24|300 billion by Commerce Department estimates.
NEUT25|Now some of that every quarter, about 35 billion came back even before the tax law change, and then some of that is new profits, right?
NEUT26|New profits are not being taxed by the US, and so those can be repatriated freely.
NEUT27|So what we were looking at is what happened to the old profits, the stockpiled profits.
NEUT28|At 2.73 trillion alright?
NEUT29|Well, who knows?
NEUT30|We'll see what happens with the house and who knows whether this outlasts.
NEUT31|Four years or what I mean, yeah Democrats, they want to you got any comments?
NEUT32|So how much do you think?
BEAR33|CEOs are holding back because of trade uncertainty, either in the EU or China.
NEUT34|That's a good question.
NEUT35|Again, the real issue here that companies move money when they need it.
NEUT36|So if they don't need the money right now there or they needed overseas because of course they are going to need some money and they do need some money to reinvest in their operations.
BULL37|In fast growing markets.
NEUT38|"So so big that the real fundamental issue here is business, not taxes."""
