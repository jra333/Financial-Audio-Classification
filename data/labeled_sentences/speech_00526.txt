NEUT0|"""Who were looking at Citigroup?"
NEUT1|What we did see this start to break to the really to the sideways action.
NEUT2|Not really making much movement.
BULL3|Overall, breaking Tord this midpoint of the range, and around that 51 eighth level.
NEUT4|This is going to be some.
BULL5|You know, some good resistance there.
NEUT6|We want to see it really hold that range, and I think is really kind of just resting at this prior low range.
NEUT7|And I think if we see any break.
NEUT8|There I think we see this continue.
BEAR9|You know, we've been seeing it as I said, having a tough time really getting over this 21 day moving average.
BEAR10|I think the markets have been struggling back and I think this if we start to see and take another move lower.
NEUT11|I think a lot of these will go with it, so I think it makes sense anyway.
NEUT12|"We are in on a short on Citigroup."""
