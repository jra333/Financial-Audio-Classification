NEUT0|"""My morning must read is from Barry Ritholtz, who's writing in Bloomberg view, taking a look at what we all missed with Apple and then what we all missed again today with Deutsche Bank he writes."
NEUT1|How is it even remotely possible that Wall Street analysts have no idea what the biggest company in the world is doing?
NEUT2|Neil dutta.
NEUT3|I know that you're not a stock picker, you're a macro guy, but you know, Barry results writes about, you know the biases that there's a bullish bias bias until too late.
NEUT4|And then there's a bearish bias until too late.
NEUT5|And do you feel?
NEUT6|Do you feel like you have these as well?
NEUT7|You get attached to a certain narrative about the economy and then you gotta stick with it.
NEUT8|I think for forecasting it's important for people to focus on the batting average, so to speak, right?
NEUT9|I mean, typically, I mean, there's actually academic research that shows you know forecasters.
NEUT10|They get one big call, right?
NEUT11|And to be wrong about everything else?
NEUT12|I just think that's I mean, think about it that way.
NEUT13|It's you know, your trick is never get anything, right?
NEUT14|Well, I mean, I think it's important for castings about weighing a range of probable outcomes and then picking your battles with the consensus wisely.

NEUT21|I was pretty cautious on the USA couple years ago, but you know you have to switch as the data changes.
NEUT22|You know, I think there's always going to be critics and we also have a we have a narrative.
NEUT23|Baetis Jamie Metzl, you get attached to certain you know writers also get attached to certain narratives as well.
NEUT24|Right yeah well.
NEUT25|You do, but then part of being dubious.
NEUT26|Thoughtful person in any field.
NEUT27|You need to have your own views and your own hypotheses and then constantly bringing in data and making your best assessments and I hope that all of us can have more than one thing right over the course of our lifetimes, but that's where that's what we're doing here.
NEUT28|That's why people are watching.
NEUT29|Bloomberg is that we're challenging our narratives everyday and that's that.
NEUT30|A thoughtful, we had Mark Farber on earlier this week.
NEUT31|We said economist since 2001 have been right 12.7% of the time.
