NEUT0|"""Right now the only thing that I would first like with that scenario, the question is, are we anticipating that scenario?"
BULL1|It is so much of that in the market and I would say when you see stocks go down that reported great numbers like Walmart and Home Depot, you're already getting a chance to be able to buy them again.
NEUT2|Why?
NEUT3|Because those are.
BEAR4|Those declines are presuming that comparisons next year are going to be too hard and I don't think so.
BULL5|I think a lot of these companies, just like Brian Cornell, said today they have picked up.
NEUT6|Just a giant amount of allegiance.
BEAR7|I do think that these companies have wiped out a lot of smaller companies because there's no stimulus.
NEUT8|I really hate to say this, but I think the Congress has.
BEAR9|Dude so many companies, the President has doomed so many companies.
NEUT10|So when you're going to get one, Walmart, its Amazon its target.
NEUT11|It's Costco, it's Home Depot.
NEUT12|I still think close.
NEUT13|I don't think closes a sale here, but that's who want that.
NEUT14|That's who won an whether we think that's fair or not, that's who won when the when Congress.
BEAR15|And the president doomed all of the small and medium sized businesses that cannot don't have credit lines and keep up there.
BEAR16|"The empty storefronts of the country, and I think that that is just a terrible thing, but there's nothing to do with the stock market."""
