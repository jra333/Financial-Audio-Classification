BULL0|"""A legal victory for Amazon."
BEAR1|A federal judge ruling that she will not order the AWS unit to reinstate parlor.
BEAR2|She writes quote that event was a tragic reminder that inflammatory rhetoric can more swiftly and easy easily than many of us would have hoped.
NEUT3|Turn a lawful protest into a violent insurrection.
NEUT4|The court rejects any suggestion that the public interest favors requiring a WS to host the incendiary speech that the record shows some of parlors users have engaged in gym.
BEAR5|Amazon's argument was that this was not necessarily a new thing, it was the result of a series of warnings, an apparent inability or unwillingness to rain in that content.
NEUT6|Yeah, I don't really get why there isn't more of an uproar against the people who are doing the insurrection, push kind of cheerleading, or suggesting how to do it.
NEUT7|I mean, that's not.
NEUT8|It's not the fault of the carrier forever say while playing the carrier.
NEUT9|I mean, if you're doing something that I regard as being genocidal or racist or taking over a country or attempting to defeat the Constitution.

NEUT11|I'm not David.
NEUT12|I don't want free speech for racism free speech for insurrection.
NEUT13|That's not what the country is built on now, and the Amazon decision was an interesting one, as of course, was Twitter's decision to not just suspend former President Trump, but to ban him.
NEUT14|Right platform interesting to note, Carl.
BEAR15|I'm sure as you saw, the Ayatollah has now been suspended.
NEUT16|Did wonder well how you could suspend and or ban the press.
NEUT17|Former president and not the Ayatollah.
NEUT18|Yeah, a lot of critics argue guys that Twitter's suspension policy is is a work in progress.
NEUT19|Yeah, few moments ago.
