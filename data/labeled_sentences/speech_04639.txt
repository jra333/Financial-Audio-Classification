NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Looking at the video and today I'll be 23 things that you need to know before investing into lemonade.
NEUT2|Let's get started.
NEUT3|First off, what is lemonade insurance?
NEUT4|Lemonade insurance is renters insurance, homeowners insurance, term life insurance and pet insurance.
NEUT5|They've also announced a new product that they have not released yet, but there are a lot of people speculating that it will be auto insurance, which will be huge for this company.
NEUT6|Before I dive into the three things that I think every investor should know about lemonade.
NEUT7|All I ask is that you hit the like button.
NEUT8|Go ahead and hit subscribe.
NEUT9|If you get any value from this video.
NEUT10|Let's get started.
BULL11|This last year, Lemonade had a 56% increase in gross profit.
BULL12|This came from doubling its gross premium, which in turn caused this $2.7 million in gross profit increase.
BULL13|The second thing that I think everybody, investors should know before in getting into this company is that they have actually increased their customer base by 64% from 2019.
NEUT14|They had 6640 three 1118 customers in this year in Q4 of 2020.
BULL15|They actually broke one million 802 customers, which is a huge increase that is 64% growth in a span of 12 months, which is really good for this company that is so young.
NEUT16|When I was doing my research on this company, I was getting pretty excited after I started seeing all the growth.
NEUT17|However, I knew that there was something else hidden, so I went ahead and kept taking a deeper look and this is what I found.
BULL18|As you can see here over the last quarter they have grown an average of 99,000 customers a year.
NEUT19|But let's take a look at what happened this quarter.
BULL20|Yes, they grew.
NEUT21|But why was this last quarter so much less significant in growth compared to the previous quarters?
NEUT22|That was my question.
NEUT23|As you can see, their advertising structure didn't change at all.
NEUT24|If anything, this way you can see the almost identical line in expenditures for advertising.
BEAR25|Now this is only thing that concerns me is they have been growing so much.
NEUT26|But why did they slow down this year?
NEUT27|This is just a big red flag.
NEUT28|If our an investor, this is definitely I would want to take your deeper look at and understand why.
NEUT29|Do they not grow as much this quarter as they should have as they had in the previous four quarters?
NEUT30|And I mean, the difference of an average of 99,000 down to 59,000 of customer growth per quarter.
NEUT31|That's a big difference, so this is definitely a company that you're going to have to do your research in before investing.
NEUT32|Going into the future and conclusion.
NEUT33|I would not say that this is a sole reason.
NEUT34|I would not invest into this company.
NEUT35|You just need to understand the logistics and the reasoning behind what happened.
NEUT36|Overall, I really like the path of this company is going.
NEUT37|I believe that they're more like the.
NEUT38|Robin Hood of insurance.
NEUT39|They're they're targeting the 21st century audience making insurance easy, so that's what I really like is.
NEUT40|They're going there innovating with the times, just like how Robin Hood did with stock exchanging.
BULL41|I think they're doing this with insurance, so overall I'm very happy with the company lemonade, and especially with the growth that they've had over the past year.
NEUT42|This is a company come Q2 that I will definitely be looking at their earnings, just like I did now to see what kind of growth or not growth did we have in Q2?
NEUT43|So if you are invested into this company, go ahead and leave a comment and give me your thoughts why you're invested into this company.
