NEUT1|We're trading underway in London.
BULL2|The washout from central bank meetings, dominates activity equity, and bond prices are both firmer thanks to the US Federal Reserve bearing once more on the side of caution that is seen via a weaker dollar as a euro.
BULL3|The pound, and notably a slew of emerging market currencies, are rallying copper and oil prices are also firmer.
BEAR4|We're also seeing a slightly weak again after appreciated in the wake of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Wednesday.
NEUT5|Sentiment, however, is being dictated by the Fed.
BEAR6|And no matter some dissenting policy, officials markets seemingly like the idea of a December tightening supporting risk assets as the further reduction in rate expectations for 2017 and beyond by Fed officials lower for longer has been the US interest rate mantra for some time.
NEUT7|And there's no sign that's going to change for quite awhile.
NEUT8|Against that backdrop, we do have the start of the presidential debates next week and the prospect of another Dow earnings season in October, so investors still have plenty to fret about before December.
NEUT9|"And whether we actually do see a rate hike this year?"""
