NEUT0|"""Still trying to look at orange juice."
NEUT1|An simply orange and Minute Maid or both Coca Cola.
NEUT2|So this is Coca Cola.
NEUT3|It had a really high dead cat.
NEUT4|I had a pretty normal crash and.
BEAR5|It's lower than.
BEAR6|That's lower than the SNP bounce, so.
NEUT7|Coca Cola is a dividend stock.
NEUT8|Not not just an orange juice stock and.
NEUT9|I know everyone thinks dividend stocks are safe and this is Brian Lewis of MMT investing and things just changed and this is not investment advice.
BEAR10|But here's how dividend stocks go wrong in a crash, so we have a three month credit contraction cycle here.
NEUT11|That's going to be sort of like this, potentially bounce bounce.
BULL12|And then we can get some positive reversal conditions.
NEUT13|Into a credit expansion.
NEUT14|And.
NEUT15|What happens if you get a dividend stock during a crash?
BEAR16|The dividends decrease the value of the stock decreases and then if you get out.
BEAR17|Which is highly likely into a longer term bear market.
BEAR18|The dividends of the stock and the price of the stock keep going down the whole time and at the end instead of being able to have like 10 of these stocks, you have one of them and the dividends are really low at the bottom and you lose most of your money and then you could start getting some dividends, but they're not worth much.
NEUT19|And so that is how dividend investing goes wrong.
NEUT20|The point of dividend investing is you want to buy at a mean reverted inflation adjusted bottom, and then it doesn't matter if the stock goes up, it's OK if it goes sideways and up is OK.
BEAR21|But down down, down down is not good for a dividend stock either.
BEAR22|That doesn't help you.
BEAR23|And this is just a look at Coca Cola which is not performing that well, surprisingly, and.
NEUT24|And dividend stocks in general.
NEUT25|I was just trying to look at.
NEUT26|At orange juice here.
BEAR27|I can't find anything.
NEUT28|I'm looking at orange juice futures and Coke and Pepsi and stuff.
NEUT29|I'll try to find an orange juice brand that's actually orange juice and see how that's doing in the crash, but this is how dividends and Coca Cola are looking so.
