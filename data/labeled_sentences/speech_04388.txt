NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Dennis and today we're going to talk about a ytu Biosciences with sticker eyt you."
NEUT1|But first of all I would like you to push subscribe button becauses if you wouldn't done it already, you can miss some really nice opportunities.
NEUT2|And here we can see MSND command where I suggest him Excel access and actually he made his research.
NEUT3|And he makes some profit from it.
NEUT4|Congratulations, synonym.
NEUT5|And we're back to a white you it is a market cap of $122 million income minus 24 sales, 8.7 million.
NEUT6|And this chart I really strange.
NEUT7|First of all, I think it is a some sort of global situation, as come a white.
NEUT8|You will exclusively distribute biologics tests.
NEUT9|And the minimum purse amount is 1,000,000.
NEUT10|2500 thousand tests.
NEUT11|On the first year it looks amazing in a normal condition that this cost around $0.50 or something like this.
NEUT12|But now in the United States they have a huge problem with tests and I think as a maximum price that they can sell.
NEUT13|It will be like $5 and if we will add $5 million to this sales it will nothing change.
NEUT14|In this situation here, how's the test looks like and actually you just need a little piece of blood or serum or plasma and the test is actually quite good.
NEUT15|There's no false positive negative results, and he's accurate for a 90% and place the test cassette on a clean and level surface.
NEUT16|Wipe and disinfect the patients finger tip with an alcohol swab here before taking the whole.
NEUT17|Blood samples were gently pinched.
NEUT18|The fingertip then use The Lancet and squeeze out the blood.
NEUT19|Use the dropper to draw the right amount of blood sample and add one drop to the specimen well marked S on the test cassette.
NEUT20|Then immediately add two drops of buffer to the buffer.
NEUT21|Well marked be located at the bottom of the cassette.
NEUT22|The result should be interpreted within three and hear how it's looks on gurufocus and maybe they have some potential, but.
BEAR23|I really don't think so because they have a really big amount of accumulated deficit.
NEUT24|As a Muslim are $100 million.
NEUT25|And actually this situation with test I think.
NEUT26|Wouldn't.
BULL27|Help them, I hope this video was helpful.
NEUT28|Please do not invest in something strange, but if you know something about a white you Biosciences please leave a comment below.
NEUT29|Maybe I'm wrong here.
NEUT30|See you later.
NEUT31|"Bye bye."""
