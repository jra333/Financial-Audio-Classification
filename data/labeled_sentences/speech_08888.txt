BULL0|"""Hey, it's Glenn."
NEUT1|This video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Very nice movement on this one.
NEUT6|Talked about how you know on Monday the price had already started to bounce an then got some more.
NEUT7|Follow through here.
NEUT8|So certainly some adjustments need to be made and the first adjustment is just in regards to the level of support and the question becomes OK. Well what direction is this adjustment needing to be made an after today's price movement?
NEUT9|The newest level of support and what I would call the ideal levels right up here at 1:15.
NEUT10|Now not to insult your intelligence, but you saw the direction I need to adjust that green line.
NEUT11|I need to move that green line up, hire an assuming you're bullish.
NEUT12|Assuming you're along, those are the types of adjustments you want to see whenever levels of support need to be adjusted higher.
NEUT13|While it's certainly not a guarantee of anything, it does represent the fact that hey, yeah, you know the Bulls are making progress and that's what you want to see.
NEUT14|You want to see.
NEUT15|Price movements continued to progress forward, and that is what you know was represented after today's price.
BULL16|We went with now having the newest level of support up there at 1:15.
BEAR17|Now if the price goes down to 115 drops below it, does that mean that the entire chart is epically destroyed?
NEUT18|I'm not saying that all I'm saying is that perfectly speaking Valve just make the chart look in, you know very impressive, because if the price were to come down here.
NEUT19|Bounce around and then work its way back upwards.
NEUT20|Know even at that point you'd still have a set of those here next to Lowe's would be down there in a few division those as stair steps you know this would be a couple of good solid upwards trending stair steps and once again assuming you're along, that's what you want to see.
BULL21|You want to see good solid uptrending stair steps.
NEUT22|And that's what would be represented there by the 115 mark.
NEUT23|Now if this trend continues on up and if it's going to continue to progress forward, the Big battle ground to watch now moving forward from the resistance side of things is that pink line right there which on my chart denotes.
NEUT24|The very well known, the very famous 200.
NEUT25|Moving average and the value of that as well just got right now one 1775.
NEUT26|So keep a very close eye on that.
BULL27|But overall the upward movement continues.
BULL28|The trend continues.
NEUT29|So let's see if the price can build upon this momentum.
NEUT30|Moving forward.
NEUT31|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL34|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
