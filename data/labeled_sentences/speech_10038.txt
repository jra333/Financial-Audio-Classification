NEUT0|"""What's up YouTube down with the Dawn Brancheau an for today's option video we're going to talk about Theta, right?"
NEUT1|It's really not much to explain, right?
NEUT2|This is your time decay.
NEUT3|You paid for the premium you paid for the, you know the real value.
NEUT4|And then there's the time value.
NEUT5|The time value is what's racing to zero and even just very quick.
NEUT6|This was short and sweet.
NEUT7|You guys can see here's your Theta we're working with this column right here.
NEUT8|You can see the closer we get, the higher Theta is the further we back off.
NEUT9|There's a lot of times there's a lot of time for it to go.
NEUT10|About time for to go down.
NEUT11|Busy, you know, right?
BEAR12|Right here we're losing $0.19 a day, so next date $0.19 right off the top.
NEUT13|That contract needs to.
NEUT14|You don't need to at least cover that for to even break even right now as we start to get closer, we start to eat time right off.
NEUT15|Where's our intrinsic?
NEUT16|As intrinsic value 0, that's that's your real value, extrinsic.
NEUT17|This is your time value.
NEUT18|How much time you have left.
NEUT19|Theta is just eating that section right at the top every day, so some of you guys wonder.
NEUT20|Hey I bought this contract.
BEAR21|The price went up but my contract went down.
NEUT22|You probably got something out of the money.
NEUT23|And it didn't cover that.
NEUT24|This is $1.78.
NEUT25|That ticker needs to move $1.78 that day just for it to break even, right?
BEAR26|So some you guys are so far out of the money that you're not even close on that it's just eating that.
BULL27|I'm up $0.77 like this.
NEUT28|Contract is not going anywhere that took off almost.
NEUT29|That was out of a 30 year contract just gone.
NEUT30|You know?
NEUT31|You needed to cover that just to break even.
NEUT32|That's why we talk about contracts that are way out of the money.
BEAR33|Sometimes they call those just the crap contracts 'cause it's an uphill battle.
NEUT34|Regardless, this is what makes options so appealing to sell, right?
NEUT35|Because right here we are negative Theta.
NEUT36|Now if you sell that call, you will be positive Theta, which means every day you just collect that money, right?
NEUT37|You collected that money when you sold it upfront.
NEUT38|But every day just locks it in a little bit further, burning up the Clock a little bit further burned off the Clock and burned into your account.
NEUT39|Just think whatever they had melting.
NEUT40|Melted right into your hands.
NEUT41|So again, Theta, if you buy the call, you are negative Theta.
NEUT42|If you buy the put, you are negative Theta.
NEUT43|But if you sell those you are positive Theta that isn't money going into your account.
NEUT44|The closer you get to expiration, the higher it is an it is running to 0 so that is your quick options Greek.
NEUT45|Remember guys I do have a course.
NEUT46|I explained all of this.
NEUT47|"All the links are in the description and I will see you Sunday for the live stream."""
