NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris."
NEUT1|Take a look at the crude oil markets and Friday hands being more of the same.
BEAR2|You can see crude oil has struggled a bit to reach down towards the $42.50 level.
BEAR3|I think at this point it makes quite a bit of sense that we could get a short term bounce, but with Russia not willing to cut production, Opec's done.
NEUT4|There's not a lot they can do, so I do believe that any rally will be sold in two.
BEAR5|We're probably looking at a move down to 40.
BEAR6|A break of 40 is really going to open up the floodgates.
NEUT7|Same thing here in Brent.
NEUT8|I think I bounced a 50 would make some sense early in the week and then a breakdown below 45 down to the $40 level.
NEUT9|No interest whatsoever in buying crude oil until economic conditions around the world change.
BEAR10|"There's just way too much oil and not enough demand."""
