NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, I just wanted to make this quick video about Facebook and about the plunge that it took just now or actually took it at 5:00 o'clock and I completely missed it 'cause I was stupid but do not be alarmed."
NEUT1|It's nothing to be scared about.
BEAR2|I put some notes all right here where Facebook fell from 200.
BEAR3|Eighteen 273 fell $45.00 and then I wrote that Google, Amazon, Intel didn't really fall like everybody is saying they fell but they are still at record highs.
NEUT4|Google Amazon.
NEUT5|An Apple, especially all those three, do not buy them.
NEUT6|It's on a buying opportunity.
NEUT7|Facebook is close to a buying opportunity and literally this is just a stock market doing what is doing best.
NEUT8|And that's always like whenever there's an earnings report and the earnings report doesn't go well like they say, oh, we lost money all of a sudden, everybody just sells it off and then they buy it later.
NEUT9|You know, while people are selling it off, the shorters are coming and selling mass amounts and then buying it up later, so.
NEUT10|It was around 217.5 and then drops all the way down to 173.5 and you guys can go look down here and these are the numbers.
NEUT11|And what I want to show you guys why I didn't freak out is because I was kind of memorize numbers and try to remember what are the good prices to buy it.
NEUT12|And I didn't even expect to do this at 12.
NEUT13|48 or 12 forty 1243 I think I don't know.
NEUT14|I can't see it at 12:45 on July 26, 2018.
NEUT15|I did not expect that, but I can show you guys right here.
NEUT16|I sold it at 172.
NEUT17|What is that right now 173 and where do I buy that?
NEUT18|Before then I bought at 1:59.
BEAR19|And yeah I did bind so and I I got money and I lost money a couple of times.
NEUT20|It just all depends and one of the price is one of the numbers I was looking at was 170 something.
BEAR21|But I do believe that it might go lower than that, so the buying opportunity might be closer to 150.
NEUT22|We're not sure, because we don't know if it's going to bounce back up again tomorrow, but just be careful out there and make sure that you guys have stop losses on.
NEUT23|But I do want to show you guys right here.
NEUT24|This is April or this is March 28th and it was at 153 and again in April it dropped again and it was at 1:59 and then you can see the other numbers associated.
NEUT25|I sold it around here.
NEUT26|Went all the way up and I was like upset that I missed out but now I know that Shorters will always create miracles for everybody.
BEAR27|12 million people sold by the way, that's a lot of people who don't really know what's going on.
NEUT28|We don't.
NEUT29|I don't think this is like a stock market crash or anything like that.
BEAR30|I know a lot of people are probably freaking out, but it should be OK and I like, I like, lost my voice or something.
NEUT31|I don't know what's going on, but I just want to make this video to show you guys that we're nearing a buying opportunity and this isn't some kind of crash, some kind of crazy thing.
NEUT32|This is overblown?
NEUT33|And yeah, don't buy any of these at all.
NEUT34|Don't even look at them because there are all near record highs.
BEAR35|They just dropped a little bit from the record highs, but they all are higher than they've ever been.
NEUT36|And even after their little crashes, so forget about Google, Amazon and Apple and just focus on Facebook.
NEUT37|And yeah, and another number is like LC RX is good to buy around 150 as well and it's still at 170.
BEAR38|So it's going down because of Facebook as well.
BEAR39|'cause a lot of tech stocks are going down so make sure you don't buy any text box until you reach the floor.
NEUT40|Then you buy him up again and if that floor is tomorrow then you have to be on guard as well.
BULL41|But thank you guys for watching that.
BULL42|I hope you guys learn from this.
NEUT43|"And that's pretty much it by."""
