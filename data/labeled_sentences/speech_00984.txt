BULL0|"""Alright, thank you Sir."
NEUT1|I know your company is oncology coming up pretty much from day one.
NEUT2|So when I understood that you had something that's a COVID-19 treatment I was thinking, is this some sort of wonder drug you have because right now the treatment for you should tell US acute respiratory distress syndrome is like nothing.
NEUT3|Yeah, so you have to understand that would happen to is we were, you know, at the time when Kovid was hitting eight eight months ago it became clear to us that we knew from the very beginning that one of our cancer drugs via 111 had the ability to be.
NEUT4|As you mentioned, an anti inflammatory, an antiviral and the reason it does that.
NEUT5|It does the same thing in cancer is that it breaks down the transportation system within the cell.
NEUT6|As you know, viruses hijack cells to make more viruses and it does that by.
NEUT7|Going down that highway system like a car and goes in and comes back out and puts out a bunch of virus.
NEUT8|But guess what information does the same thing but it does?
NEUT9|Is nose normal cells as inflammation cells.
NEUT10|They take bags of cytokines that stuff that causes that distress, syndrome, respiratory distress, exam dumps it out.
NEUT11|How does it do that?
NEUT12|Go through that same highway system to get on the outside and sell and dump it out so when it dumps so when you take it right back here 111 that disrupts highway system, breaks it up, then virus can't get in and.
NEUT13|And I'm toy stuff can get out, and so we thought maybe that would make sense for us to go after COVID-19 and we kept it low key because even though the preclinical work, the animal that they work in, you know looking at anti virus that made sense, and looking at the inflammatory response, we actually looked preclinically to see if we had an effect on that.
NEUT14|We did.
NEUT15|But you know, at the end of the day it's what happens in humans and we went right into the Lions den.
NEUT16|We said the way the show this is to take patients that are ill with severe COVID-19 patients who have been dying basically right.
NEUT17|I mean this is the edge line later.
NEUT18|Absolutely fundamental.
BULL19|Later there on oxygen called WHO 5 severity which is which is very very high and there on oxygen in the hospital and and we were able to, you know, show some really hard endpoints.
BULL20|So for example, a hard endpoint is death and so we showed a reduction of death of.
BEAR21|30% in Sumi reduction the deaths from 30% in the placebo arm to five point 3% in the treatment arm.
