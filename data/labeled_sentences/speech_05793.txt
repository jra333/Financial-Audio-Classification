BULL0|"""Even while a crisis in the Ukraine pushes stock prices lower, a few barons pics are moving higher."
NEUT1|I'm Jack Carter, editor of Barons, with Jack how who writes for the magazine.
NEUT2|Anne writes some great stock picks, but today for the first time in weeks we're not going to talk about your stories.
NEUT3|I did absolutely nothing last week.
NEUT4|OK, staycation sat around and take notes off my To Do List.
NEUT5|No golf.
NEUT6|OK, little nippy here in New York.
NEUT7|Well with the drums of war beating, let's start with Flowers.
BULL8|FTD florists is moving higher today, newly hired nicely, and I learned something I learned a lot in that article.
NEUT9|But among other things, I never knew it.
NEUT10|FTD stood for florists, Telegraph delivery.
NEUT11|You no longer need to Telegraph to order, right?
NEUT12|But it shows you as an old company.
NEUT13|It's a recent spinoff.
NEUT14|The stock has little to no coverage yet on Wall Street and it's it's a pretty cheap business.
NEUT15|This is a company where that I think the stocks in the low $30 range, 32 ish thereabouts and it's earning just over $2.00 a share now.
NEUT16|Could be $3 a share in a couple of years time.
BEAR17|There's some charges on the books and amortization charges that are sort of masking the earnings power of the company.
NEUT18|So so our writer argues that the stock is cheaper than it ought to be ran.
BULL19|It's up about 2 1/2% on that move.
NEUT20|Also spin off.
NEUT21|So I was kind of like spin off.
NEUT22|You know they take a discrete company that its benefits might be hidden within a larger conglomerate.
BULL23|Put it out there and the managers are obviously highly motivated to make it work.
BULL24|Certainly the healthiest part of the business got a lot of cash flow going forward, so there's a lot to like.
NEUT25|Let's move on to undersea drilling.
NEUT26|This is a category that hasn't been doing very well, but obvious.
NEUT27|Holtzman says there's a company that is worth investing in Atwood Oceanics.
NEUT28|He argues that the factors that have been impacting these companies don't apply as much to this company.
NEUT29|It has some newer rigs that charge higher rates.
BEAR30|The issue that's out there is that investors were the day rates for some of these rigs are moving lower, but the transition and some other companies have been hammered have an ugly 2014.
BEAR31|Yeah, outward is down.
BULL32|Considerably, but it has some contracts locked in for the next couple of years.
BULL33|It has newer rigs, so the earnings power simply looks stronger.
BEAR34|Looks like a number that sold off with a struggling group right now.
BULL35|That's maybe stronger than investors are giving it credit for that stuck to is up about 2 1/2 percent.
NEUT36|When I checked an finally will talk about Barnes, an Noble Andrew Berry has been a fan of this company even though most Noble.
NEUT37|Yeah, most people think you know they get up for dead Barnes Noble.
NEUT38|He's like to since 14.
NEUT39|I think it's around $20 now and he says hey you know look at the valuation.
NEUT40|It's a it's a company that's three times ebata an mostly other retail chains are over 7 times ever, so it's cheap.
NEUT41|It has a lot of cash and there's still a lot of good things you can do with this business, and it could be, you know, potential takeover candidate down the road.
NEUT42|People still buy books, not everyone buys them online.
NEUT43|I do buy them.
NEUT44|I don't read as many as I buy, but I do.
BULL45|Bottom Thanks very much.
BULL46|"Yeah, thanks Jack."""
