BULL0|"""90 minutes into the trading session and Apple has become the first company in U.S. history to hit $2 trillion, a $2 trillion market cap."
NEUT1|Four 6777 was the magic number.
BULL2|It's now trading at roughly four 6827 cents, so Apple, a $2 trillion company, look $2 trillion is the first time a U.S. company is hit this mark.
BULL3|Basically this is kind of a redemption for Apple to a degree.
NEUT4|So many people were counting it out as this growth in the smartphone market started to really slow down, we saw that globally with the likes of Samsung and Apple obviously, but apples seemed to pivot at a certain point, basically putting a lot of its eggs into services as well as wearables.
NEUT5|Kind of spreading out its business rather than sitting just on the iPhone.
BULL6|And that's clearly paid off.
NEUT7|They do, of course have that billion plus user base.
NEUT8|That is a huge part of its growth story because as it began to pivot two services.
NEUT9|And wearables it was able to dive into those users and kind of get them to sign up for different things such as Apple Music using the App Store, Apple Care things like that under services.
NEUT10|And then of course the air pods which are now essentially iconic.
BEAR11|At this point they really blew up apples.
BULL12|Now the largest wearables maker in the world thanks to those and the Apple Watch.
BULL13|So clearly the company managed to grow with the iPhone and they will still get more iPhone customers out there.
NEUT14|But it really is about spreading out and kind of a more holistic approach is focusing on the iPhone itself, and that's what's helped drive it to $2 trillion.
NEUT15|Hey Dan, its Julia.
NEUT16|I remember being on set it was like fall of 2018 when it was kind of countdown to the $1 trillion market cap.
NEUT17|Now we're at 2 trillion whatever remarkable timeframe to hit such a milestone.
NEUT18|You just referenced a number of the the areas where you're seeing growth.
BULL19|How remarkable was it though that we were able to see that kind of growth given a pandemic and ensuing recession.
NEUT20|How do you kind of think about that in just the resiliency of Apple going forward?
NEUT21|Yeah, I mean look this came less than two years after they hit one trillion less than a year after they hit 1.5 trillion, which they did as you alluded to, in the midst of a pandemic.
NEUT22|I think really, what is helped?
BULL23|Apple here is the knowledge that after the pandemic is over, whenever that happens here in the US, they'll still have customers who want to, you know, purchase new phones, and in the meantime they're able to lean into those services, despite the fact that they may not be able to go to stores look.
NEUT24|I can jump online right now and get a pair of air pods sent to me in no time.
NEUT25|Ditto the Apple Watch and don't forget they were sold out for quite sometime.
NEUT26|I think really the the continuing growth story will be based on what Apple is able to do with newer technologies like 5G.
BEAR27|We're expecting that iPhone 12 to be delayed and again this comes the $2 trillion mark comes, despite the fact that Apple is said that the iPhone will be delayed for a few weeks past its normal launch date.
NEUT28|So I think this is really.
NEUT29|Just indicative of the kind of.
NEUT30|The trusted a lot of investors having the company going forward.
