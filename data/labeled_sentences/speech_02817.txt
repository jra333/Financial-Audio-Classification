BULL1|Athyrium is in a strong uptrend.
BULL2|The bullish momentum is similar or even stronger than Bitcoin's recent surge.
NEUT3|Above $50,000.
BULL4|The Ethereum recent surge up has been strong, price moved from Dollar 400 dollar 500 to the $2000 resistance level in just three months.

NEUT8|Let's review the key wave and chart patterns.
BULL9|The Ethereum recent surge up has been strong, price moved from Dollar 400 dollar 500 to the $2000 resistance level in just three months.
BEAR10|Now bearish pressure seems to be actively pushing price action lower again.
NEUT11|Is this a reversal or just a retracement?
BULL12|In our view the probability of a retracement is much higher than a reversal.
NEUT13|Why?
NEUT14|Because the recent push up is a typical pink wave 3.
BEAR15|This means that the current pullback is probably a pink wave for waves.
BEAR16|For usually chop a corrective and shallow retracements, the 23.6% fit in Auchi level already acted as support, but price action broke below it.
NEUT17|The next support zone is the 38.2% FIB or 50% fibo Nachi levels.
BULL18|These fibs are expected to act as support and should create some bounce to the upside.
NEUT19|The key pattern to look for as an AB triangle pattern.
NEUT20|If this chart pattern emerges, then it indicates the end of the retracement.
BULL21|That should give a green light to the up trend to continue for a new higher high.
NEUT22|After the price action completes, 5 grey waves in pink Wave 4 the uptrend should break the pattern and move N blue arrow only a very deep correction puts the uptrend and out orange and red circles.
BEAR23|On the four hour chart, we can see that the Ethereum bullish momentum is temporarily over.
BEAR24|Price has broken below the support dot green trendline in the 21 amazong.
BULL25|Price action should be able to reach the 38.2% FTA Nachi level where support support is expected.
NEUT26|If a triangle pattern does emerge, then there should be multiple ABC patterns visible in each leg.
