NEUT0|"""Alright, let's answer your questions now."
NEUT1|First up serrata come to you from Jason in Toronto.
NEUT2|What are you thoughts on Visa?
NEUT3|I like visa here.
NEUT4|I like all the payments, a Visa, MasterCard, PayPal.
NEUT5|These are secular growth companies that are going to grow for the next few years, not just quarter, so I would hold it and buy it on dips.
NEUT6|OK, Josh Brown next to you is a question from Twitter from GMO.
NEUT7|Let's keep talking about inflation, running hot.
NEUT8|Forgive me looking over my computer screen, but I'm reading it off of this.
NEUT9|Let's talk about Barrick Gold.
NEUT10|I'm long and strong.
BULL11|It has a clean balance sheet with a possible special dividend.
NEUT12|18 month price target of 35 to 40.
NEUT13|What do you say?
NEUT14|Sounds like?
NEUT15|He already has a pretty good idea.
BULL16|Pretty good idea, Josh.
NEUT17|I mean if if gold miners didn't work in the last year, I don't understand in what environment they would ever work.
BEAR18|You literally just had the biggest growth in the money supply in the history of the Galaxy and these stocks sucked.
BEAR19|They always **** the GDX gold miner ETF has sucked since inception from 06 through today.
BEAR20|It's almost 15 full years, it's down 7%, the S&P 500 and the time is tripled.
NEUT21|You really could have made money.
NEUT22|More money in a savings account, so I'm not a fan.
NEUT23|Anytime I buy a gold miner it's always an accident.
NEUT24|I always regret it sometime afterward and May God have mercy on your soul.
BULL25|Alright John Jerry's fine, I'm sure it's fine.
NEUT26|Yeah sure.
BULL27|Thanks for the recommendation.
NEUT28|Sounds like you're all behind it.
NEUT29|Doc video question for you.
NEUT30|Let's let's see.
NEUT31|Hi, this is Steve Wegman from San Diego.
NEUT32|I'd like to know what's up with Rocket Mortgage.
BULL33|It's an industry leader and appears to be undervalued.
NEUT34|Thank you.
NEUT35|Well, thank you for the question.
BULL36|Appreciate it struck.
BEAR37|Well, I think it is undervalued Scott.
BULL38|And obviously it had a tremendous short interest that helped carry it over $40 a share at the beginning of March.
NEUT39|Now a month later, it's back down here at 22.
NEUT40|They just pushed a block of 20 million shares out last week at about 25, so now would be a great time, I think to accumulate this one down here at 22 to $23.00 a share.
NEUT41|OK, nice little move for that one as well.
BULL42|"RKT up two and 2/3 percent."""
