NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Everyone, my name is Jose and today we're going to be talking about what Neil has in store for us on Neo Day, which is January 9th this upcoming Saturday.
NEUT2|Before we begin, make sure you hit that subscribe button.
NEUT3|YouTube told me that 95% of you guys watching are not subscribed, so make sure you hit that subscribe button for me.
NEUT4|Thanks before we begin this.
NEUT5|Let's just at Meijer this beautiful EP.
NEUT6|9 That's right here.
NEUT7|Yes, that is an eel vehicle that you're seeing right then and there, and it's all electric.
NEUT8|And it's just so beautiful to look at jumping into Neo Day and what to expect.
NEUT9|Is we already know that Neo is confirming 2 new sedans that are coming out?
NEUT10|Neo is very known for their SUV's, and they currently have no sedans, so this is huge for them because it's going to make them go into another sector of the EV market.
NEUT11|They are also coming out with another SUV and one thing that you want to keep in mind is that it is actually confirmed that a lot of people are requesting this vehicle in the demand is so high, then Neil actually needs to get another factory.
BULL12|This is huge news because if they get another factory, that means production goes up, that means revenue goes up.
NEUT13|Another thing to keep in mind is that Neil is planning on going into the European.
NEUT14|By Q2 of this year, that's June 2021, and that's amazing news.
BULL15|That means more production and more revenue, which means higher stock prices.
NEUT16|Not all the time, but for the most part.
BULL17|Yeah, in my unprofessional opinion, I definitely think that Neil Stock will rise above $70.00 by the end of this year.
BULL18|They are doing so much in there competing directly with Tesla.
NEUT19|Yes, Elon Musk.
NEUT20|They're competing right neck and neck with them.
NEUT21|Keep in mind that don't be surprised if you see any type of dips or anything like that in their stock prices just because.
NEUT22|They're implementing a new revenue structure.
NEUT23|What I mean by that is there, including a battery as a Service plan for customers that actually don't want to buy the vehicle with an actual battery.
NEUT24|So what this means is they can buy the vehicle and then the battery can be separate and they can literally go into one of these battery powered stations and they can swap out the battery just easy.
NEUT25|As that, aside from the battery stations that they have, they actually also have a van that literally goes around.
NEUT26|That's 24 hours and seven days a week for customers.
NEUT27|When your battery dies.
NEUT28|So the band will just come up to you and they will recharge your battery enough for you to get it back to another charging station or another battery swap.
NEUT29|Please keep in mind with this battery swap you can actually only get it six times a month, which I think is far more than enough.
NEUT30|I think you get like around 268 miles per battery, so if you need more than that, that's probably because you're traveling, but you can always use the battery stations as well.
NEUT31|Tesla actually tried to do this battery swap thing back in the day and they actually only had it in California.
NEUT32|They only built one facility.
BULL33|For it, and apparently Ilama said that it just wasn't helpful for customers, so he didn't even develop it soneos taken advantage of all of the things that they can do in China because they're also backed by the Chinese government, so they're adding all of these battery stations and it's working out really well.
NEUT34|So that's it for today guys.
NEUT35|I can't wait to tune in on Saturday to see exactly what's going to happen with Neo and what they're going to come out and what new technology that's going to change the stock for the better.
BULL36|Thank you guys for tuning in.
NEUT37|And like I always say we're here breaking the cycle, making sure that our future generations are wealthy and healthy.
NEUT38|"I'll catch you guys in the next one piece."""
