NEUT0|"""Another thing that will be launching this quarter, which is really interesting, is a global fund which looks at 40 different countries across the world."
NEUT1|We created our own database.
NEUT2|Analyzer of your.
NEUT3|Going back in time found that this works as well with foreign companies as a U.S. companies.
NEUT4|Can you trust those numbers?
NEUT5|Well, that's a great question.
NEUT6|We haven't even.
NEUT7|We've looked at the databases internationally and decided that we have to create our own.
NEUT8|So going back and look there, have people have done studies.
NEUT9|After I wrote the book, there are a number of Wall Street firms that did studies that showed it worked in every country.
NEUT10|You know, they tested about 12 different countries and these principles value investing.
NEUT11|For instance, buying cheap, buying good works and all these countries according to their.
NEUT12|Research we haven't bothered to do that because a we have no doubt that these principles work, but be the data is not or not very good.
BULL13|In outside of the US, the US is pretty good.
NEUT14|Compustat for instance has a great product and a number of others outside the US.
NEUT15|The data is not so good so that if you use bad data, garbage in, garbage out, you'll have some of the outliers coming to the top.
NEUT16|We decided two years ago that we had to create our own database for the global and we did.
NEUT17|We also have our own database for the domestic and we're going to launch something for formula investing and make it accessible to people to invest in 40 different countries.
NEUT18|In a group project in a group with about 45 companies in that portfolio and so that will be a unique fun product that we're launching this quarter, you're going to have a formula that can work for financials and utilities.
NEUT19|If I get time, I really started this project about seven or eight years ago with one person.
NEUT20|We now have just in research.
NEUT21|We have 17 people working on this now, and so it's on our list.
NEUT22|I would say but.
NEUT23|This thing kind of snowballed much larger than I ever imagined when we started with one person and it was sort of just a proof of concept.
NEUT24|You know of the things I've been teaching and using over the years and so it's kind of snowballed into a big deal.
NEUT25|And that's certainly one of the things that we want to develop, but we haven't.
NEUT26|We haven't even attempted it yet.
BULL27|"We have so much on our plate."""
