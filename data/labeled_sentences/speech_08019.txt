NEUT12|While I enjoy Bomoseen is at customer obsession.
NEUT13|My decisions have a real and direct impact on our customers might create the shift band based on customer demand.
BULL14|And actually get to see the customer orders fulfilled.
NEUT15|What's important, Amazon is being able to put yourself in the place of the customer, so whenever we have a decision to make here, all you have to do is ask yourself.
NEUT16|Is this something I would want to receive if I were a customer?
NEUT17|I've been working in Amazon now for just under a year and the best thing for me is the people.
NEUT18|What I really like about my team is that it's an international team.
BULL19|It's a really hands on team and it's just a pleasure for me as an area manager to work together with those people.
NEUT20|Everybody brings something different to the table.
NEUT21|I don't have one favorite thing like the people and the challenge we're always looking for better, more productive ways to work.
BULL22|One of the success stories that I have about customer obsession is when we received an unexpected spike in orders.
NEUT23|I made the decision to order extra vehicles to ensure that all our parcels got to our customers on time.
NEUT24|No problem.
NEUT25|Come back to me then.
BULL26|I'm sure we can accommodate.
BULL27|That's a great feeling and a great experience to enjoy.
NEUT28|I've never been bored at Amazon.

NEUT30|No two days are the same.
BULL31|And every day feels like it's day one in the two years I've been at Amazon, growth is strong.
NEUT32|Three sites have opened in the UK, and I myself started in a new site here in Doncaster.
NEUT33|We've gone from being a sortable site, which is DVD's and books to a non sortable site which is TV's and microwaves and you will have to work hard, but you will have even more fun.
NEUT34|And when I started working here we actually started theme days where you dress up according to a certain scene.
NEUT35|You start seeing some pretty crazy people who like to take it to the limit.
NEUT36|Amazon's motto is.
NEUT37|Work hard, have fun, make history if you like working with great people and you love a challenge, what are you waiting for?
NEUT38|Why don't you come and experience your own?
