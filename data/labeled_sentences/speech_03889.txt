NEUT0|"""By the way, thanks for joining and watching this quick video on Air France, KLM, so this is a stalker and main stock price."
NEUT1|One hour candle stick and in front of us.
NEUT2|It is the merger trained with Blue Line of the price showing the prices movement.
BEAR3|So as we can see and it's easy to understand that the prices have been moving in a bearish condition since the virus came in.
NEUT4|The majority of the stocks just in the middle of March, April they started going sideways while.
BEAR5|These stocks like our France and others, you know they went down sides so this is not really good signal.
BEAR6|Mean because keep going down sides in bearish bearish trend.
NEUT7|It seems the older exam of those companies that they had the same price believe they went or they filed for bankruptcy.
NEUT8|This is not the case for sure.
BULL9|I hope no because anyway these companies caught a couple of weeks ago with a 7.7 billion billion bailout from EU government from France.
BULL10|And think Dutch government so so it's so should be should be OK. Should be fine.
NEUT11|So if you would like to invest in this company.
NEUT12|Generally, all deadlines businesses it is still on all the.
NEUT13|So you might be still to stand aside, not invest into it.
NEUT14|Especially now if you want to go long.
NEUT15|It's not a time to go along but just wait.
BULL16|Today, the price will bounce up again.
BEAR17|So this Amber line I can work as first races support or the price might keep going down up to this level through most of 3.5 euros and then you should see my jump up again.
NEUT18|So just let's wait that one of those two.
NEUT19|Supports will be tested before going long in this talk.
NEUT20|So again, in conclusion, because he's a bearish trend, actually there is no any reversal signal.
NEUT21|It's not still right time to buy and to get into these markets or just cold before going along, even if they've got some money from Europe.
NEUT22|But please just hold and whether I signal to go longer than that as it is now, there is no any right signal to go along in this stock.
NEUT23|Actually, as the main major trend is bearish and is moving inside the channel, it's really not.
NEUT24|Good time to invest and to go along in this talk, at least not for now for perhaps next week.
NEUT25|Just let's wait.
NEUT26|What's gonna happen in the next weeks?
NEUT27|But please?
NEUT28|In conclusion, old and just wait, I signal before buying the address.
NEUT29|You can be that this dotted line will be tested as resistance or December land will be tested as resistance and always compare these headlines with other airlines businesses.
NEUT30|"Thanks bye."""
