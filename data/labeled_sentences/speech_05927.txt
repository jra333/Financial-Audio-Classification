BEAR0|"""You take some chips off the table well, what's happening on the medical front is bad."
NEUT1|It's unfortunate it's not scary, but you need to be careful and vigilant first.
NEUT2|Rates will just start picking and I want to look at the bank Nifty.
BULL3|More than the nifty because for me that really holds the key, because that would tell you that which raise the risk in the market seems to be moving the advance decline ratio is much better than what we looked at in a long, long time.
BULL4|It's definitely better than what we've seen last week, and it's definitely better than what we saw yesterday, so he has the best the bank makes with the bank.
NEUT5|Nifty is about 300 points.
NEUT6|The HDFC Bank is not rising higher State Bank of India is not shipping in so the bank Nifty which innocence got plastered yesterday is not showing any signs of excitement or any signs of you know action.
NEUT7|Now let's look at some of the high beta names.
BEAR8|Ann Metals last night again I won't do the work there.
BULL9|But yeah, metal stocks did manage to outperform and metal prices were also strong.
NEUT10|So where are all the steel stocks?
NEUT11|Because that's right now the gueto space statisti late 73 just means such a blog here for Tata Steel GSPL.
NEUT12|Followed by JSW Steel.
NEUT13|All of them are rising, and they're rising quite the smartly, another one which we rarely mentioned is the GSW Jindal.
NEUT14|His are in general stainless same group on the gentle group.
BULL15|The brothers are separate businesses but large part of the market share always puts goes towards JSW Steel and Jindal Steel and Power, but Jindal Stainless is off to a good start.
NEUT16|Gentle Hisar is also off to good start so the breath is OK. Bajaj Auto Bajaj here Finance let's not lose sight of that.
BEAR17|Because what they reported for the 12:45 by the book definitely seems to be slowing down.
BEAR18|So the growth is now contracting.
NEUT19|It's not reached back to the main level like a lot of other businesses reach back to their pre covid levels.
BEAR20|Some pockets of Bajaj Finance on an aggregate basis are still struggling, but the markets are telling you let's not read too much into what you heard yesterday in terms of a forward looking indication.
NEUT21|So absolutely flat as we speak right now.
NEUT22|Let's see where we head from here.
BEAR23|Having said that, yesterday's fall has been installed, but again, early days you don't know what direction the markets could take from here onwards, don't quite think my screen is refreshing, But yeah, I can see PVR wengi, CIBC visa stocks which is still lower in trade right now.
NEUT24|Metals continues to be that the one definitive trend which is still.
NEUT25|Holding up and they also aside of Bajaj Finance.
NEUT26|Want to check in on what a D mark is up to watch over developers is doing because remember they also came out with their Q4 updates so those talks will just come up here in your screens.
BULL27|Having said that, George Finance already took a hit of 6% yesterday today.
BULL28|It's rebounding by about 1 1/2% from the nifty.
BULL29|There's nothing to report, but like Ninjas well was highlighting the breadth is positive in that release.
NEUT30|The key takeaway?
NEUT31|Let's have D Mart as well as super developers on your screen show Bob Costas had a record.
NEUT32|What up?
BULL33|And very strong commentary as well.
NEUT34|Coming in, we all know the kind of revival that you've seen in Realty, say sales more so the affordable ones Apollo hospitals RBL Bank Jindal Steel sale.
NEUT35|These are high Flyers this morning.
BEAR36|On the flipside, Kotak Bank withdraw gas B&B ONGCAU bank.
BEAR37|"They continue to face pressure."""
