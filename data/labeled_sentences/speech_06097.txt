BEAR0|"""I'm Mark wreath here with the incredibly handsome Michael Finelli and our stock of the day is dumb."
NEUT1|Starbucks.
NEUT2|Wait a minute dumb Starbucks like what is dumb Starbucks?
NEUT3|So apparently there's this comedian, Nathan Fielder, who's pretty good comedian I guess.
NEUT4|Actually yes, set up dumb Starbucks.
NEUT5|This is part of a parity, a stunt for his show on Comedy Central Out in Los Angeles, and I guess from my understand lines were out the door.
NEUT6|People waiting to get their free cups of coffee there.
NEUT7|Dumb cups have come there.
NEUT8|Dumb cups of coffee, but with almost anything in life.
NEUT9|Mark, you get what you pay for.
NEUT10|'cause from what?
NEUT11|I understand that.
BEAR12|Coffee tasted terrible and bitter.
NEUT13|Dumb parity coffee again today.
NEUT14|OK, so regular Starbucks.
NEUT15|The one we can actually invest in.
NEUT16|Yes.
NEUT17|How do they do this last quarter holiday season?
BEAR18|How are things they did fantastic actually, you know, and especially in a time where most retailers were actually complaining about, you know massive declines in foot traffic.
NEUT19|That wasn't the case here.
BULL20|With Starbucks, they saw strength across the board in all of their stores, not just here in the United States, which of course, is the largest part of their business.
NEUT21|And most important to their bottom line.
NEUT22|But they also saw in the Asia Pacific region and also even in Europe.
NEUT23|You know when people are crying recession over there as well.
BULL24|They saw strength, so the company is doing extremely well and were a lot of other retailers.
BEAR25|Like I said, we're complaining about, you know this this paradigm shift, or seemingly about this paradigm shift from brick and mortar retail to e-commerce.
NEUT26|That doesn't really seem to be affecting Starbucks as much.
NEUT27|OK, so is all that going to carry through into the future?
NEUT28|Should I be buying Starbucks now?
NEUT29|I think you should.
NEUT30|I mean valuation.
NEUT31|It might seem a little bit pricey.
NEUT32|Of course you've gotta normalize its current PE ratio because of.
NEUT33|The legal settlement with craft, but even when you look at it from like a price to free cash flow basis, I think the company looks from historical basis.
NEUT34|It looks kind of attractive to me to be honest with you.
BULL35|I think it's a tremendous brand.
BULL36|It's got huge potential for growth.
NEUT37|Not just here in the United States but also overseas as well.
NEUT38|You figure they have 4000 little over 4000 stores over in the Asia Pacific region.
NEUT39|I think a little over 1000 and CEO Howard Schultz said himself that he believes China is going to be the second largest market behind the United States.
NEUT40|So I think there's a huge path for growth there an you even look at the opportunities that they have to leverage their existing sorbas right now to sell additional to generate additional revenues for various dayparts different parts of the day.
NEUT41|You look at Leblond hurray, for instance, if I could even pronounce that, but you look at they have all these other opportunities.
NEUT42|Is the bottom line.
BULL43|So I see a lot of growth going forward.
NEUT44|"Alright, definitely something much more from my screen really marker if that's our stock of the day, will see you tomorrow."""
