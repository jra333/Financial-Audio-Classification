BEAR0|"""Hey guys, GameStop misses its estimates how rarely traders will take benefit from this."
NEUT1|And I have also got this little technical chart ready for you.
NEUT2|We will do a little technical analyzers so let's get into it.
BEAR3|GameStop missed Q4 estimates, but reported a strong comp sales in early Q1 cutted depths an named OCO GME stock turned lower ad management abruptly ended up postponing conference call.
BEAR4|I believe that it was a good quarter for GameStop cause overall debt was reduced by 57 million and the company had 635 million in cash up from 513.5 million a year ago.
BULL5|CEO George Sherman said that we are off to a strong start in 2021.
BEAR6|As February compatible, store sales increased 23% led by continued strength in global hardware sales, share gave up late gains to fall 10% after closing down 6.55%.
BULL7|At 181.75 on the stock market today, GameStop stock soared as high as 483 in late January, but tumbled in February before rebounding, slightly an falling again this month.
BULL8|GameStop remain above its 50 day and 200 day line as well year ago levels.
BEAR9|According to Marketsmith chart analyst GameStop found itself in the middle of short squeeze mania, bought on by Reddit groups.
BEAR10|Wall Street bets which looked to take on the hedge funds, who bet that GameStop would fall.
BEAR11|Financial Service Committee grilled officials in February about relationship between Robin Hood trading app and the Wall Street after the app placed restrictions on the GME stock.
BEAR12|An other Reddit short squeezes stock so we all know about that.
BEAR13|The sort squeeze could be running out of juice.
NEUT14|S&P Global Market Intelligence shows that sort squeeze.
BEAR15|Selling overall fell in late February with short selling in GameStop.
BEAR16|Stock tumbled more than 80%.
NEUT17|The investing strategy by Wall Street needs a heavily shorted stock for the quick gain.
BULL18|If the stock is heavily shorted and if Wall Street bets would take that stock a little up then then all those short sellers will buy this stock so heavily shorted stock would make quick gains for ready traders.
NEUT19|Now let's talk about this chart a little bit.
BEAR20|So previously on 22nd of February I have told you that this is forming a doozy candle.
BULL21|It's a reversal trend signal.
NEUT22|Earlier, the signal was cell an.
BULL23|From here it reversed an from 43.
BULL24|It popped up to 346.
NEUT25|Now again, we're seeing a long tail candle and.
BULL26|We can expect that from here trend will change a little bit and also it is squeezing in this pattern.
NEUT27|So it is also forming a flag.
NEUT28|So signal is for long but in the end we can't deny the fact that it's a risky stock.
BEAR29|I may lose my money.
NEUT30|"All I would say that please do your own due diligence before investing."""
