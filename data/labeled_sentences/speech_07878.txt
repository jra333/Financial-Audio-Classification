NEUT0|"""Alright, everyone here we are with ticker symbol AAPL, Apple Inc. And before jumping to share I want to say welcome to all my first time users and investors."
NEUT1|Welcome to my channel and welcome back to all my subscribers.
NEUT2|Let's see what this chart has to offer so it broke through resistance and definitely do not use it as support because yeah it did at the beginning and it ran a broke through the resistance baloy hitting like one 1562 quick recovery and then dipped and to the point that.
BULL3|The Bears broke through resistance and the 50 day moving average.
NEUT4|Hitting loads of even.
NEUT5|One 1360, so we're going to see the new points of reference here for this chart so that we can pay close attention to what is important for tomorrow.
NEUT6|This is a very close stretch here for the Bulls and the Bears having this tug of war to see who gains possession and the volatility.
NEUT7|Was there rose all the way up, hung out above it, and tore right back down through it.
NEUT8|So let's go ahead and put this to our new points of reference.
NEUT9|I'm going to narrow this down very close here.
NEUT10|'cause that's the last highest point in the day an I'm gonna zoom in.
NEUT11|But apart from these numbers, I want you guys to know other numbers according to which direction the stock.
NEUT12|Decides to head.
NEUT13|So.
NEUT14|The first resistance level here, which is the lowest point.
NEUT15|Of the bearish run here and then the dip.
NEUT16|It is.
NEUT17|One 1757 that resistance level I would write it down if it breaks through this first one that I have more zoomed in.
NEUT18|This is the next point you want to pay very close attention to and if it breaks through that this could be on its way to newer highs and breaking through resistance levels and moving further away from the 50 day moving average.
NEUT19|The 50 day moving average is one 1521 want to see if I can land on it?
NEUT20|It's jumping between 22 and 20, but one 1521 is the 50 day moving average.
NEUT21|And this close not at one 1522.
NEUT22|This is a very important tug of war for tomorrow to see.
NEUT23|Are the Bulls gonna recover or are the Bears going to quickly tear this one down so?
NEUT24|The support level the first one.
NEUT25|If this was the breakthrough, the 50 moving average is 114 twelve.
NEUT26|If this gets broken through, I pay very close attention to what's going on with the stock and will it reach nor Lowe's the next support level.
BEAR27|After that is one 1363 and that is the lowest point that it reached in today.
BEAR28|And if that gets broken through, this is much deeper into bearish territory, and the Bears are going to do everything it takes to tear through newer Lowe's and new support levels and move further away from one 1521.
NEUT29|Which is the 50 day moving average in a downward direction on the other spectrum?
NEUT30|What the Bulls want to do for them to start?
NEUT31|Even breaking through resistance levels, turning them into support?
NEUT32|Staying above the 50 day moving average in a upward direction?
NEUT33|They're going to want to breakthrough one 1557.
BULL34|Turn that into support and start to work their way up to newer highs.
