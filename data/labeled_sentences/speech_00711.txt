BULL0|"""Shares in Tesla up 3% today."
NEUT1|That means the market cap of the company $556 billion as it prepares to enter the S&P 500 on December 21st.
NEUT2|Goldman Sachs is raising its rating on the company that happened after the close yesterday.
NEUT3|Mark Delaney is the analyst.
BULL4|Terry raised his rating to buy from neutral.
NEUT5|The price target is 780, which is the highest on Wall Street right now and he basically said the shift toward battery electric vehicle adoption is accelerating will occur.
NEUT6|Faster than our prior view, what's also interesting is that he talked about not just the cars for Tesla, but the other stuff that Tesla does.
NEUT7|I mean, we never talked about Solar City anymore, but it got wrapped back into Tesla, so it's interesting that he highlights that as a potential growth opportunity as well.
BEAR8|Miles, you know, I, I don't know what Tesla could do wrong at this point that would dissuade people.
NEUT9|Yeah, you know it's funny.
NEUT10|You mentioned the note having comments on on the other stuff that Tesla does.
NEUT11|We're all old enough here to remember when the other stuff was the main thing to be excited about, and that wasn't as exciting as story.
NEUT12|Now we're going back to they sell a lot of cars.
NEUT13|I think it's interesting to see a projection out to 2040 from Goldman 15 million cars a year by 2040.
NEUT14|Sure, I mean, you know why not?
NEUT15|At this point, I think it's such an interesting.
NEUT16|Story on a number of levels and the level we're looking at Tesla on today is how do analysts make sense of a stock.
NEUT17|They get a lot of questions on a stock.
NEUT18|The street you know.
BEAR19|Some analysts have not been very right on the stock.
BULL20|Other analysts have been very right and are even more bold up the higher the stock goes, but it's an emotional name.
NEUT21|Brian sozzi.
NEUT22|Everyone has an opinion.
NEUT23|Everyone has to have an opinion.
NEUT24|It seems on Tesla and so I think to see a shop like Goldman come out and basically throw up the white flag.
NEUT25|On this thing at this point in time, right?
NEUT26|As it's about to be included in the S&P and as Julie said, I mean consensus is what could go wrong sauze, but that always kind of puts up your Spidey sense, right?
NEUT27|Maybe maybe something will.
NEUT28|Bob Miles, I know all the Tesla Bulls out there on Twitter that love to tweet negative things.
NEUT29|To me.
NEUT30|They're cheerleading this.
NEUT31|They love this call.
NEUT32|They see Tesla selling 2030 forty million cars by 2050.
NEUT33|That's all fine and good.
NEUT34|Goldman Sachs are going to hear this, but we just focus on the rating here.
NEUT35|Neutral rating.
BULL36|Tesla's been over 600% this year in miles.
NEUT37|We've had these discussions in the past as a stock analyst.
NEUT38|You're paid big money, especially if you work in Goldman Sachs to make big calls or just get it right in some form.
NEUT39|This analyst has clearly been out to lunch, which ultimately begs the question, can you put a little a lot of stock in what he's calling now?
NEUT40|Calling out now with regards to ending 20 million potential vehicle sales for Tesla, I think this note happens to disregard some of the competition this company is going to see over the next 5-10, fifteen, 20 years from very more established automakers.
NEUT41|For General Motors, you name it.
NEUT42|I mean at the same time when a companies action price action can at times be so divorced from fundamentals and is really more of a sentiment stock.
NEUT43|To be fair, it's hard to predict how something like that is going to do.
NEUT44|"I mean, it's really that X Factor that is difficult to analyze kind of to Miles's point about trying to get your hands around us talk like this."""
