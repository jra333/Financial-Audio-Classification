BULL0|"""Hey, welcome to a new video."
NEUT1|We will take a look at ticker Bingo and see what's happened and where it might be headed next.
NEUT2|My prediction was accurate.
NEUT3|Bingo is in a consolidation mode for the time being until today's earnings report.
BULL4|If Bingo announces an upbeat earnings report, it may finally break this strong resistance level at Dollar 9.70 to reach the next level of resistance at Dollar 11.10.
BULL5|I think that's the highest being go can go with a good earnings report.
BULL6|Being go is a long term investment and it will need more good news to break all resistance that is preventing it from going to dollar sixteen where many analysts predicted is going to tomorrow will be a crucial day because it may either go down or up if it goes down, it will probably reach and support level around dollar rate where it may remain for a short period of time.
BULL7|I'm bullish on being go.
NEUT8|I'm 100% sure that in the long run the stock will be around dollar Twenty.
NEUT9|That's my prediction for being the long term, but this is not a financial advice.
NEUT10|On March 24, being go will have a live webinar.
NEUT11|Where Doctor Francis High will explore how she used Bionano saphyr system for optical genome mapping to analyze structural variations in a large cohort of patients with CDH in their parents and how it has led to the identification of critical genes and pathways creating improved understanding of the disorder.
NEUT12|"Like I said in my last videos, being go is doing a lot of events to show the power of their number hash one."""
