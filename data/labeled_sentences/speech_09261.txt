BULL0|"""Chinese Evie maker Neo is upping the ante with tests on the mainland."
NEUT1|The company has launched a mass.
NEUT2|But what could be the world's longest driving range?
NEUT3|CEO William Li told Bloomberg exclusively while he says the 87 will not be in competition with the Model 3 for market share.
NEUT4|I feel like I saw 87 CT, Seven is Neil's first self-driving car.
BULL5|It sufficiently shows Neos capability, an autonomous driving, and it's also our first sedan in mass production.
NEUT6|The pricing of the sedan.
BULL7|It's close to about 70,000 U.S. dollars before subsidies, so almost twice the price of a Tesla Model 3.
NEUT8|Are you concerned at all about the pricing?
NEUT9|Are you comfortable with the pricing at this level?
NEUT10|Taller Joel means the 5th and changeful.
NEUT11|What we're always very clear about our target user groups.
NEUT12|For example the price of RET seven is similar to the ones that the best selling midsize or full size sedans in China like BMWs five class.
NEUT13|Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E Class.
NEUT14|Their sales numbers are at around 10,000 cars per month.
BULL15|Our strategy for the Chinese market is to provide better products and service at a similar price of gasoline cars.
NEUT16|Top Toyota junk.
NEUT17|We, of course, believe as an autonomous car.
BULL18|It's worth the price as the best vehicle in the premium market in any aspect, from every detail of its design, internal space to service go Family Dollar Premium, just coming in.
BEAR19|In fact, after the launch, many from our user, community and media think the pricing is probably a little low.
NEUT20|That's an immediate finding controlling the gentleman at the Lydia.
NEUT21|The competition, obviously, which says that continues to heat up.
NEUT22|Do you see the ET7's putting you and Neo in a different class?
NEUT23|She's at home more than salty clients had a size, ET7 is not a card.
BULL24|Competing with Tesla's Model 3.
NEUT25|If comparisons are to be made, it is more of a rival to the Model S. 87 is very competitive based on this market position.
BULL26|In terms of deliveries that we see more broadly for Neo, yeah, December, the numbers were very good.
BULL27|Again, more than 100% increase year on year in terms of deliveries.
BULL28|Yeah, so you see that pace of sales, that pace of growth continuing this year.
NEUT29|Dow was Henderson Tim jenda.
BULL30|I of course believe China's EV market will keep growing this year.
BULL31|Neo is prepared for such growth.
NEUT32|Chinese EV market had a big change last year.
BULL33|The percentage of personal purchase has been increasing.
NEUT34|Which means EV has become a rational choice for many Chinese consumers eat in some way.
NEUT35|You gotta face honey.
BULL36|It's in English and so now we think it's very positive.
BULL37|We are very confident that Neo has room for growth in terms of our market segment.
NEUT38|Well my life is not that it's not included on the sizing.
NEUT39|William, can you update us on your international expansion plans or your priority markets?
NEUT40|And what is the time frame that we're looking at?
NEUT41|We need your mentality about adding.
BULL42|We have clear plans to enter the European market this year.
NEUT43|We will gain experience from a specific country and region to understand how to meet the needs of local users, how to introduce Neos community culture to different countries.
NEUT44|Communities under one far from this perspective, we still have work to do.
NEUT45|Tattoos symbols on the young who?
