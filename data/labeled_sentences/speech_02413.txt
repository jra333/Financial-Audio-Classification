NEUT0|"""Plus joining us now to break down the numbers."
NEUT1|Bernie Mcternan from Rosenblatt Securities and Jim Stewart from the New York Times.
BULL2|Very good afternoon to you both.
BULL3|Thanks for joining us Sir Bernie.
NEUT4|I'll come to you on the call numbers first.
BEAR5|Initially shares moved down then up.
NEUT6|What's your key takeaway?
BULL7|Yeah, so was it beat on the quarter and as you guys mentioned, margins were higher expression on cable net.
NEUT8|So that's one thing that we're looking for is if it was mainly driven by sports rights and that so then the September quarter then pick back up.
NEUT9|We're also looking for commentary on the call on Disney Plus subscribers, so we have the 100,000,000 aggregate subscribers.
NEUT10|But really how they paste after the quarters?
NEUT11|And notably because Hamilton came out in the beginning of July.
NEUT12|July 3rd, yeah Jim Jim Stewart.
NEUT13|What's your take on Disney?
NEUT14|Plus how it's doing from its launch an where it sits against its competitors?
NEUT15|Well, it's obviously a key element to the Disney future because a lot of the things about these earnings are, you know, specific to the pandemic and they are going to go away.
NEUT16|But Disney Plus is their decades long investment in the future of the company.
BULL17|I think these numbers are pretty good, but I agree I hearing anecdotally that there has been a lot of subscriber growth in July.
NEUT18|You know they again they had Hamilton.
NEUT19|They had to Beyonc√© concert video, a lot of adults are.
NEUT20|Moving towards it.
NEUT21|I mean, I think they've got all the families with kids, but if they lost part of Disney can really come in and they start drawing in a nontraditional Disney customer.
BULL22|I think that will be very, very positive.
NEUT23|So I would love to hear them address that issue.
BULL24|In addition to the sheer numbers, because adult growth is ultimately ultimately going to vastly expand their addressable market.
NEUT25|But he told us about that cable number because it sort of sums up their headline number for the for the entire business, which was that.
NEUT26|A bit on the bottom line, but a miss on the top line.
NEUT27|And what does that imply for the rest of this year?
NEUT28|Yeah, certainly, and so cord cutting and and and media networks subscribers so something that we are laser focused on.
NEUT29|We think cord cutting is going to be accelerating during the pandemic, so that's why you know the top line expectations are what matters and that's where it's going to hit.
NEUT30|And so when I was mentioning before about Sports Network costs, well obviously the NBA in the MLB weren't happening in the June quarter, but they are happening September quarter, so that's why when Christine gives her puts and takes about what's happening next quarter really interested to see if there's a greater just.
NEUT31|The amortization of sports right costs get moved from the June quarter into the September quarter.
NEUT32|Jim, what would you want to hear from Mr. J. Peck on the call?
NEUT33|But I definitely want to hear more about the ESPN situation again look, let's face it.
NEUT34|Parks are terrible, but they're going to come back big Studio Entertainment.
NEUT35|That's going to come back when there's a vaccine.
NEUT36|ESPN is that ever going to come back?
BULL37|That I mean, honestly, that it did a little better than I expected.
BEAR38|I thought there would be more cord cutting this quarter an even lower revenue than there is in the danger is that some of those people may never come back once they're out of the habit of watching on cable.
NEUT39|And there's, you know, the big question for Disney is.
NEUT40|Ultimately, do they have to move ESPN to direct to consumer?
NEUT41|I think most people think long term they're going to have to find a way of making that tradition.
NEUT42|Meanwhile, they're trying to mill the old cable model.
NEUT43|The question is, how long can that go on?
NEUT44|So I would like to hear him address the dynamics of that cable strategy and the subscriber status and adds Tab 3 SPN.
NEUT45|I just want to hear how many how many people are going to Disney World and what that experience is like a burning mcternan.
NEUT46|Thank you.
NEUT47|Jim Stewart.
BULL48|"Always good to talk to you."""
