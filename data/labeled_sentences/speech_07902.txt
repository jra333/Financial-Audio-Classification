NEUT0|"""The car T hype train has officially left the station here in 2018."
NEUT1|2017 was really all about car T stocks and the reason why there was so much hype was because it was this new innovative approach to really supercharge the body's own immune system to fight and target cancer well, as we have seen with many biopharma stocks along the way, just getting to approval is really the first hurdle of many Carty stocks is no different.
NEUT2|Todd Carty is just not yet that billion dollar blockbuster that we were hoping to say.
NEUT3|It's a great reminder, Shannon, of how often times the pre launch expectations are just too optimistic.
NEUT4|I mean, everybody thought that these these therapies, which are incredibly complex and they're incredibly expensive, I think, was like a half $1,000,000 all in plus to have these gene therapies given to patients.
NEUT5|And I think that.
NEUT6|You know, yeah, it takes a long time some to get these things launch kind of build up momentum for him and maybe that's what we saw here in 2018.
NEUT7|Is that you have these Great Expectations coming into the year you had Gilead Sciences?
NEUT8|Go out and buy kite pharma.
NEUT9|Spending nearly $12 billion to get its hand on that car T its sales this year, year to date are only 183 million and then you got Novartis is kymriah?
NEUT10|They develop that one in house and launched that one as well last year.
NEUT11|If sales this year only about 48 million, so you've got.
NEUT12|Less than 250 million in sales through the third quarter, four CAR T drugs that are on the market and that is, like you said, very shy of kind of the blockbuster hype that was associated with these drugs.
NEUT13|Yeah, and I think some of the challenges with Carty, they certainly haven't been exclusive to Carty.
NEUT14|But when you consider that you're taking a patients T cells, taking them out of the body, then you're actually genetically modifying them in a lab and then putting them back into a patient.
NEUT15|You can imagine the logistical steps that are required and also to just the manufacturing variability from patient to patient.
NEUT16|And of course that also depends on the patient's health that can change too.
NEUT17|So I think the challenge of just logistics.
NEUT18|Oftentimes these patients also are in an inpatient setting, so their hospitalised while they are receiving this car T treatment.
NEUT19|And so then the cost you mentioned, you know half $1,000,000.
NEUT20|Now that goes up exponentially when you start talking about all the other.
NEUT21|Acute care costs that are associated with that too.
BEAR22|Yeah, and I think that for investors listing and say OK, yeah, these parties haven't lived up to expectations this year.
NEUT23|What what could happen next year in 2019?
NEUT24|I think.
BULL25|I mean obviously now we're getting more data in that shows that these therapies are still durable.
NEUT26|I think Ash earlier this month.
BULL27|Yes, Carter showed had data that showed that 39% of patients still were in response after two years.
BULL28|That's good.
NEUT29|You see durability like that.
NEUT30|That helps to increase confidence when doctors and using it and payers and using it.
NEUT31|So maybe you get a nice little.
BULL32|Slower than hoped, but build in sales in 2019 that you want to keep an eye on absolutely and certainly keep an eye on the reimbursement end of things.
BEAR33|These drugs have had challenges just getting reimbursed by public and private payers, so that'll be another issue.
BULL34|"But yes, I do think things will slowly turn around for Carty stocks."""
