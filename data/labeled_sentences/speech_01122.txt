NEUT0|"""Who's coin the cryptocurrency that started off as a joke is no longer a laughing matter."
BULL1|For some people, the dog themed crypto is up 1000% year today thanks to support from Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, No Kidding, and other celebrities, Coindesk says.
NEUT2|Dogecoins rise reflects the power of collective belief and a longing for a more ideal form of crypto, and it is time to take it seriously.
NEUT3|Joining me now is Emily Parker, the writer of that Coin Desk op Ed.
NEUT4|Co, host of first mover on Coindesk TV Emily.
NEUT5|I'm not convinced.
NEUT6|I mean, I really do think that Doge coin is like Digital Chuckie cheese tokens.
NEUT7|I mean, they're really valuable to a toddler at Chuck E cheese, but once you leave my goodness, I mean in three years, is this really going to have value?
NEUT8|I mean, I get what you're saying and those court is in fact ridiculous.
NEUT9|However, are Chuckie cheese tokens?
NEUT10|Do they have a market cap of $7 billion?
NEUT11|Do they have 1000% return year to date?
NEUT12|So there is.
NEUT13|There is some difference, right?
NEUT14|And the point that I'm making is not that Doge coin is like a serious investment.
NEUT15|It's just that if this is real money, and I think it really reflects the moment that we're in now, where basically collective beliefs and collective action on social media can create a kid can really raise the price of an asset.
NEUT16|And that's what we've seen with.
NEUT17|Doge coin, and that's what we've seen with GameStop.
NEUT18|Yeah, I hear you.
NEUT19|But I, you know, on your point about the market cap.
NEUT20|I think if we gave 4 year olds the power to make serious financial decisions, would you like this car or would you like this bag of Chuck E cheese tokens?
NEUT21|They would pick the bag and you know.
NEUT22|So in a way, I think it is analogous.
NEUT23|So is this more time to take it seriously?
NEUT24|Those coin itself or time to take seriously the fact that people are so swept up in this meme, like moments?
NEUT25|They've taken on a financial significance that can have real world implications.
NEUT26|Yes, I think the way you phrased it is actually more accurate.
NEUT27|So just to be clear about encouraging people to buy dose cocaine, I'm just saying that.
NEUT28|Just saying that this is it, does it?
NEUT29|That's exactly right.
NEUT30|We're just in a really interesting moment where assets are kind of being valued by the the masses by the mob, by social media, and I think those coin is just a perfect representation of that.
NEUT31|Of course there are people who truly believe in Doge coin, but I don't think that all the investors in those coins are investing based on fundamentals or invested their investing based on kind of like a a crowd sentiment and the fact that you know it's it's.
NEUT32|It's just part of a zeitgeisty as we're learning.
NEUT33|More than ever in 2020 and 2021, there are people who truly believe in all kinds of things that may or may not have a fundamental basis, and so be careful out there investor.
NEUT34|Whether it's GameStop, AMC Doge, coin, what have you, Emily Parker of Coindesk?
