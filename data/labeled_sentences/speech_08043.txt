BEAR0|"""Is the stock market about to crash?"
NEUT1|Will there be a crash in June 2020?
BEAR2|Are we entering a global depression?
NEUT3|Why is Warren Buffett piling up billions of dollars in cash but not investing?
NEUT4|Are we going to see a V shaped recovery or a U shaped one or will it be L shaped recovery or the new W shaped recovery?
NEUT5|I'm hearing all sorts of negative and positive reviews about the market, but when will the next market crash happen?
NEUT6|Or will there be another stock market crash like we had during March 2020?
NEUT7|The answer to this question is simple, nobody knows the exact answer.
NEUT8|Let me tell you something which no one has ever told.
NEUT9|Whenever people predict that the market is going to crash, for example, June 4th, it's never going to happen.
NEUT10|It's just not possible to time the bottom of the market.
NEUT11|People never knew about the 87 crash orthe.com bubble or even global financial crisis.
BEAR12|I've been hearing about the market crash and about the recession from early 2017.
NEUT13|And the crash happened in 2020, specifically, during the month of March, and that too, no one had ever thought of it.
NEUT14|The crash was solely due to pandemic and not based on people's predictions.
NEUT15|We know that market goes based on people's emotions, but now things have changed.
NEUT16|the Fed is trying to save the Wall Street by its printing machine and the day fed stops printing.
NEUT17|Oh boy, we will have a roller coaster in the market also.
NEUT18|Never forget the power of the Federal Reserve Bank, also known as the Fed.
NEUT19|They have also told that they are going to do.
NEUT20|Everything to their full potential.
NEUT21|To save the economy and stock market they are pumping trillions and trillions of dollars into the economy and into the Wall Street and bailing out large billion dollar companies.
NEUT22|Even the crash during the month of March was an accident.
BEAR23|People became too emotional about the pandemic and started off panic selling just after the crash.
BULL24|Jerome Powell announced that they are going to do everything to save the economy.
NEUT25|An Wall Street by printing an infinite amount of money.
NEUT26|And guess what?
BULL27|We have the Dow Jones rallied around 7000 points so far.
NEUT28|The power of the Fed.
BEAR29|Most of the you tubers and media publications are just exaggerating the market by creating a false opinion on the market.
NEUT30|You tubers are just talking negatively about the market because it's more interesting.
NEUT31|Rather than hearing something positive for the last three years, people have been saying about the crash, which never occurred until recently.
NEUT32|Thank you.
