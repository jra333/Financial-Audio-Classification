NEUT0|"""Welcome back is the 15th of October 2020, Thursday, the 4th day of the week we are at #9 Cardono with the ticker ADA."
NEUT1|So where we foreigner against BTC?
BEAR2|We're expecting Carreno to form a squeeze over here.
BEAR3|Yes, Sir, I'm expecting a squeeze.
BEAR4|We're also expecting Karen to drop lower.
NEUT5|How much lower?
BEAR6|Yes, this is a noisy area which we are expecting Cardano to drop down to.
NEUT7|Yes, I still think that more likely than not we should be dropping here first before we make any moves towards the upside.
BEAR8|Which means that we're anticipating a potential 36% drop for corono.
NEUT9|So there you go.
BEAR10|Now things are just not looking good for Cardano yet.
NEUT11|Not yet.
NEUT12|I think eventually real, but not yet right, and so you're doing now is the time to be going long for car.
NEUT13|No more likely than not.
NEUT14|There should be more downside for corono against BTC, so be very careful about going to a trip to soon as we want to add against USD T. But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know which team, what color know in the comments below.
NEUT15|Look for Cardano against USD T. You're anticipating a mountain range of sorts, right?
BULL16|And once this mountain range completes, I think we're going to be going under the skinny pink line, but there's also potential that things could turn bullish.
NEUT17|So at this time, we're still we're still unclear what the color wheels are trying to do.
BEAR18|I just feel that more likely than not, the direction is down.
NEUT19|We still have more downside to go for Cardano before we go any higher anyway, this doesn't really look like a.
BULL20|Bullish continuation chart.
BULL21|And yet we need to form a bullish continuation chapter.
BULL22|We need to see Big Green volume coming in to push kernels price higher.
NEUT23|I just don't see it moving any higher yet, so.
NEUT24|Yeah, things aren't really exactly that clear yet.
NEUT25|I think this could be a tree with move.
NEUT26|Could even turn into a five wave move towards the upside, yeah.
NEUT27|And so we could move up first before we move any lower.
BULL28|So yeah, again like I think you're very careful about going to trade for Karen because we are anticipating more downside against BTC.
NEUT29|So if he drops against BC.
BEAR30|More likely than not we should also be dropping against USD.
NEUT31|So be very careful about going to a trip through soon.
NEUT32|Alright, I guess I see from my current technical analysis.
BULL33|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL34|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT35|I shall see you in the.
NEUT36|"Next video."""
