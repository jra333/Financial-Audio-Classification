NEUT0|"""Say you bought a house that costs $200,000."
NEUT1|If you closed in May with a 30 year fixed rate mortgage when interest rates hit a rock bottom 3.35%, putting 20% down your monthly payment is $705.00.
NEUT2|But if you waited until mid June when interest rates jump to 3.98%, the monthly payments for that same mortgage would be $762.00.
NEUT3|An additional $57 per month.
NEUT4|Why are mortgage interest rates?
BULL5|Rising interest rates are closely tide to the yield on 10 year Treasury notes.
BEAR6|Treasurys have been hovering the past few years at historic lows in 2012, it was 1.5% by mid June it picked up to a still very low 2.25% yr Treasuries.
BULL7|Rising.
NEUT8|First, let's explore why Treasury yields and thus mortgage rates, have been so low.
NEUT9|You have to look no further than the Federal Reserve.
NEUT10|It's been on a more than three years spending spree, buying Treasuries and mortgage backed securities.
NEUT11|This is how fast the feds.
BEAR12|Assets have become coming to $3.4 trillion when the Fed buys Treasurys its demand for them keeps the prices higher and therefore the yields lower interest rates come down as banks have more money to lend and mortgage lenders are able to offer super cheap home loans because they can bundle them together.
NEUT13|Resell them as bonds to the Fed and turn a quick profit.
NEUT14|This WSJ's David Wessel puts it like a junkie hooked on heroin.
NEUT15|The market has become addicted to the federal reserves $85 billion month bond buying.
BULL16|Program but with signs of improvement in the economy.
BEAR17|Investors are betting Uncle Sam spending spree may soon come to an end.
NEUT18|When will the Fed start weaning the economy off stimulus?
BULL19|the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the Central banks program, called QE three, will continue until there's substantial improvement in the job market.
BULL20|He also said recently they will likely start to trim their bond purchases within the next few meetings.
NEUT21|So should you rush out to buy a house now, not necessarily, mortgage rates are still super cheap.
NEUT22|Historically, 30 year loans are usually 5.5%.
BEAR23|Or higher than most economists expect rates to stay well below that level for a long time to come.
NEUT24|"That's the short answer."""
