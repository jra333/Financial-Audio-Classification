BULL0|"""We could talk a little bit about specs 'cause I see you're active once again on this."
NEUT1|I don't want this pack attack, but on Twitter, but we do have.

NEUT4|I find it to be exciting.
NEUT5|It's almost prurient, right.
NEUT6|Can we really think that it's right up there with trying to figure out what's going to happen today with Disney?

NEUT8|And you guys are doing it.
BULL9|Unbelievably well.
NEUT10|So the question.
NEUT11|I think there's two questions.
NEUT12|Do you think that investors should be investing at this pack level?
NEUT13|Meaning right now, so we're looking.
NEUT14|We were just looking at Churchill for a second.
NEUT15|Or do you think that the better investment is to wait and see what they buy and then by on the other side of the D SPAC?
NEUT16|It seems to me I will tell you that buying on this pack is not a terrible idea and most of those folks have actually made a decent amount of money, not like the sponsors.
NEUT17|Of course on the D's backside on a relative basis too.
NEUT18|And I the two to an IPO index.
BEAR19|They've actually underperformed.
NEUT20|Well.
BULL21|I enjoy your deal of book piece was the best on it.

NEUT23|That's exactly what I think and that was a primer for everybody.
BULL24|It's also exciting piece that you did.
NEUT25|So yes, there's no doubt about it.
BULL26|If the earlier the better and the as it goes on, it just becomes another investment actually has underperformed other investments.

NEUT29|People should read your piece you want to own Disney today still absolutely swim because position in my child's biggest Christine McCarthy.
NEUT30|This is CFO there, she's extraordinary and she's extraordinary.

NEUT32|I understand that Tom Rogers may say Netflix.
NEUT33|I think the disease may be one of the greatest bands ever.
