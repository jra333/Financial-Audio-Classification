NEUT0|"""Why should the stock market crash?"
NEUT1|Or will the market crash?
NEUT2|There are a few important reasons why the market should crash.
NEUT3|Firstly, we can see that all investors and billionaires are hoarding billions of dollars in cash.
NEUT4|Warren Buffett recently sold all his stake in the airlines.
BULL5|An is building up his cash pile.
NEUT6|He is currently sitting on $137 billion in cash.
BEAR7|Also, Carl Icahn is predicting a housing market crash similar to or worse than the global financial crisis of 2008.
BEAR8|While George Soros is also pessimistic about the market, Ray Dalio is predicting a depression kind of a crash Buffett indicator, which is widely used by investors, shows that the market is significantly overvalued.
BEAR9|Many billionaires are shorting their position seeking a market crash.
NEUT10|Looking at all this, it makes us think that the market will surely crash, but we need to remember the Federal Reserve Bank or the Fed, also known as the Savior of Wall Street.
NEUT11|They are printing an infinite amount of money and recently pumped in $2 trillion into the market through their CARES Act.
BEAR12|They bailed out airlines, which recently are catching up all their losses.
BULL13|American Airlines surged 41% points in a day.
BEAR14|We can see that the economy and the market are going in opposite directions when there is an unemployment report announced.
BEAR15|We see the market rally, recent unemployment data results made the Dow Jones market surge by 829 points and people are still thinking about the market crash.
NEUT16|Look at this tweet by Trump.
NEUT17|He is stating that the rich guys are negative about the market.
BULL18|He has clearly made it sure that the stock market will be up at least until the presidential elections.
NEUT19|One should know the Federal Reserve Bank chairman is independent, but he is elected from the president.
BULL20|This makes it clear that no matter what happens to the economy or Main Street, that market or Wall Street will keep going up, and the New York Fed says the US is not anywhere near its limits to run up debt.
BULL21|They are planning to inject another $3 trillion stimulus.
NEUT22|The market will keep going up and less.
BEAR23|We hear negative news about the virus and pandemic.
NEUT24|We know that the main reason for the crash of 2020 is the virus.
BEAR25|The entire world economy is dooming due to the pandemic, and countries are investing billions of dollars into research in order to find a potential vaccine.
NEUT26|Whether a vaccine will be found or not is a future thing, and the market is based on future predictions.
BEAR27|There can be two chances for the market to crash, either the researchers failed to get a vaccine for the virus, or we see a second wave.
BEAR28|Both are really bad news and we don't know the exact answer to both these questions.
BEAR29|If a second wave hits, many people will sell off all their positions.
BEAR30|This will lead to even more panic selling among investors.
BEAR31|The market will crash like hell.
NEUT32|The crash of March would look nothing.
NEUT33|It will keep going down and down and less the Fed comes with its printing machine.
NEUT34|An pumps in a few trillion dollars.
NEUT35|All they care about is the Wall Street.
NEUT36|Anyways, I don't want to see a crash because millions have invested most of their money into the market.
BEAR37|If market crashes, everyone will lose hopes and go into bad situations.
BEAR38|They'll lose everything except for those who have shorted their positions.
NEUT39|That is the billionaires.
BEAR40|Or there is one other thing which can make the market go down.
NEUT41|I'll answer that in the next video.
NEUT42|Please like and share this with one friend.
BULL43|"Thank you."""
