BULL0|"""Sirius XM has had a very big run."
NEUT1|It's got brewery smart ownership is, David knows.
NEUT2|I wonder whether they were just out where they tapped out.
NEUT3|Once this is all they could do because I've got to tell you.
NEUT4|I think Spotify is the real engine here.
NEUT5|I don't want to go up against Spotify.
NEUT6|To me it says, OK, we're finite in serious.
NEUT7|We're flying out with the car now.
NEUT8|We gotta go to the home.
NEUT9|It makes me like serious left.
NEUT10|Less.
NEUT11|Frankly, David, can you help me here about what serious needs?
NEUT12|Why they need to do it when they told us all for the last five years is that thing run?
NEUT13|Why the heck we don't need anybody.
BULL14|We're doing terrifically David.
NEUT15|Why did they need Pandora?
NEUT16|Well, 70 million users in the US is not a bad place to start, I think.
NEUT17|I believe you know, Jim, they won't tell you this, but you know.
NEUT18|Is there risk in the car?
NEUT19|You know I can only speak anecdotally in terms of by experience.
NEUT20|While I may be listening to Sirius, my kids are not there, reached on the Wi-Fi that's available in the car listening to Spotify.
NEUT21|And Pandora, to be fair, that was under new management.
NEUT22|Jim turned itself around over the last year.
NEUT23|I think that is a fair point to be made here.
NEUT24|Right and you told us that they bought in pretty low.
BULL25|They got a good price.
NEUT26|But what I think I've now I don't think it's anecdotal anymore.
NEUT27|David, I think it's empirical, but we all kind of figured out.
NEUT28|Wait a second.
NEUT29|There's an Apple Jack in every car.
NEUT30|Why do we have to listen to?
NEUT31|Serious when we can listen to our own stuff, serious does have a lot of proprietary programming, but at the same time, you're absolutely right.
NEUT32|There's a lot more lives, so to speak, that they've got locked up.
NEUT33|I think it was just very important, because I think that is Carl, said Amazon Apple.
BEAR34|These companies want the car serious, doesn't have the balance sheet they have, and maybe it was just a matter of time before Syria started losing customers.
BULL35|There's an article today in the Journal, but used cars doing well used cars.
NEUT36|They come with.
BEAR37|There's been a tremendous, serious used car.
NEUT38|Crossover autos are no longer gaining.
BEAR39|David individual ownership of autos may have peaked.
NEUT40|That's why I think they need to do Pandora.
NEUT41|That's an interesting point.
BEAR42|Sure, with with us are coming down, potentially Jim.
NEUT43|That's well, well, well made that point.
BULL44|That said, serious is up 22% over the last 12 months.
NEUT45|So the last time they came through at the offer, that was somewhat similar.
NEUT46|The fact is they don't need as much stock to actually complete that offer this time, so it's gone their way in terms of waiting Pandora out for the opportunity that they've been seeking now for well over two years.
NEUT47|Well, I can say it, but putting my mad money had on this damn money happen.
NEUT48|Your Philadelphia putting my man money had on what are the only thing I can tell you is is that these are two retail oriented stocks when retail wins the market does get a little exciting we this is a welcome antidote to the Canada stocks which really kind of took over the narrative last week and made a lot of us worried about speculation.
BEAR49|Those stocks have cool.
BULL50|We got some retail stocks doing well today.
NEUT51|Obviously Disney and Comcast retail stocks too.
NEUT52|Maybe there's a little more excitement to the stock market that is not just.
BULL53|"Endless waves of SMP money coming in."""
