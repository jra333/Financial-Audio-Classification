NEUT0|"""I'm dan.fitzpatrick@stockmarketmentor.com on Monday, October 28th and I want to continue on the chart that we looked at on Friday, where I suggested on Coca-Cola here."
BULL1|The stock was just breaking out of this downtrending resistance line, just kind of breaking above the 50 day moving average and now testing.
NEUT2|Now it is testing the 200 day moving average.
NEUT3|My suggestion really was look when the stock starts or if the stock starts moving higher that's when you want to be a buyer.
NEUT4|Because it's telling you it's telling you that no longer is the 50 day moving average acting as the top of the range, like it did all the way through here the green line.
NEUT5|But instead it's actually been broken through and now it's not particularly relevant, and so that's exactly what's happened.
NEUT6|We got that move today.
BULL7|Consumer staples are moving really nicely, and this is one of them.
NEUT8|And So what I would suggest doing is staying long Coke, and in fact, if Coke starts trading above.
NEUT9|If it starts trading about 40 bucks then I would want to add to that position, but I think for now you can just kind of hang onto it and let it work.
NEUT10|This is not a super high volatile stock, so you're not going to get rich trading this, but you're also not going to get broke either, but the trade is working.
NEUT11|It broke through that trend line, and that's really what we were looking for.
NEUT12|So OK, that's it.
NEUT13|Members over to the strategy session.
NEUT14|We're doing a little shift in focus here on our trading, so I want you to get.
NEUT15|"Get the gist of that."""
