NEUT0|"""Well, I have to tell you there's some great misperceptions of actual people keep saying, yeah, but look, I mean, the lithium ion battery when it's not the darn battery, it's the motor and it's indispensable for every one of these companies, right?"
NEUT1|Jim, absolutely.
NEUT2|This is so key, and it's because when people think about materials for EV's, and there's a lot of excitement, there's a question.
NEUT3|Is it?
NEUT4|Lithium ion?
NEUT5|Is it solid state?
NEUT6|You've certainly had some coverage of that, or hydrogen or capacitors.
NEUT7|Who knows what the technology will be, but that energy gets to a motor, and the 90 plus percent share way that the motor moves.
NEUT8|And we believe for you know the decades to come, is that permanent magnet?
NEUT9|The rare earth magnet?
NEUT10|And so our materials go to make those and so.
NEUT11|And you know, we we are agnostic to to whatever OEM wins, whether it's Tesla Rivian arrival, GM, Ford, Volkswagen at any of them, you know we want them all to be successful and whatever the battery technology is, we think we're picks and shovels play for for this movement.
NEUT12|And this is something that we want an American company to be involved in in one of your conference calls.
BULL13|You made it very clear that the Chinese have, over the last 30 years figured out.
NEUT14|Basically, I'm going to use the term, not you.
NEUT15|Corner the market in rare Earth.
NEUT16|If we don't have MP materials, they could own that whole food chain.
NEUT17|For every EV car.
BULL18|Yeah, well Jim, look at the enterprise value that exists today in our markets for some of the major Chinese EV companies, and so the Chinese over the last 20 years have moved downstream and they you know, they're competing in this industry and to their credit, it's it's really impressive what they've done.
NEUT19|You know our mission at MP materials is we want the the Teslas GMs apples of the world.
NEUT20|Whoever is utilizing magnets, they all they buy them all in China and we want them to buy them from us.
NEUT21|Or at least we.
NEUT22|You know, we'd like to take some share and show that an American company can compete in this space.
NEUT23|We already are.
BULL24|We're profitable and and we're a young company and we're focused on on being a formidable competitor in this space.
