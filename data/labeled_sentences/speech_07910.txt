NEUT0|"""Today's financial focus is all about IPOs."
NEUT1|Money expert coach Pete from Capital Financial help us understand if this should be for you.
NEUT2|Coach Pete.
NEUT3|What is an IPO?
NEUT4|Well exclusive event?
NEUT5|A lot of times where a company is initially coming out into the stock market, the company could have been in business for years for decades.
NEUT6|But now they decide to become a publicly traded company, an one of the ways that they could do this is have an initial public offering of the stock to make the general public aware of it and have them have the ability to buy some of that stock.
NEUT7|So why is there so much hype around them?
NEUT8|Because they they like that because it's.
NEUT9|This is the time where the people that are in charge of the company can make a whole lot of money.
NEUT10|Because when the IPO comes out they said initial public price and you'll see that in the night before they'll say it's going to come out at 55 or 60 or $80.00 a share.
NEUT11|Well, everybody who buys that in effect puts cash in the company's pocket.
NEUT12|The owners of the company make a whole lot of money on IPOs, so is it warranted sometimes and sometimes not?
NEUT13|Now, here's where you have to be careful, because when IPO comes out, let's say it comes out at $50 a share.
NEUT14|Well, most people can't get it 50 'cause the minute it hits the market starts to go up like crazy.
NEUT15|'cause supply and demand.
NEUT16|Everyone wants it.
NEUT17|So I've seen stocks come out at the IPO at 50 and they closed the data 150.
NEUT18|What if you were the person that bought 150 feel kind of ripped off?
NEUT19|Everybody else got it for a lot of people got between 50 and 150.
NEUT20|Here we have to be careful.
NEUT21|There's a certain period of time after the IPO where the insiders people that like maybe they made money a lot of times on the IPO.
NEUT22|But they also have extra stock they can watch into the market but they have to wait a certain number of days.
NEUT23|So when a lot of people start to sell.
NEUT24|After the IPO, what happens to the price goes down?
NEUT25|I bought Facebook at $17.00 a share years ago after it came out IPO it went all the way up to like 80 and then it came down after the insider started selling to 17.
BULL26|Now it's bounced back.
NEUT27|It's over 250 C. So it's not about buying.
NEUT28|It's when you buy.
NEUT29|That's the most important thing.
NEUT30|And also I always say you should never buy a stock until you know when you're going to sell the stock you need to exit strategy as well, but IPOs are exciting.
NEUT31|They generated a lot of curiosity and a lot of spinoff companies pick up money too.
NEUT32|So let's say this IPO company specializing in.
NEUT33|Hydrogen power, well, let's say that you can't get in the IPO or you want to do some research.
NEUT34|You look around and you find out there's two other hydropower companies that already out there and they get lifted up a lot of times too.
NEUT35|'cause everyones running into the new company and they say, well, I don't want to pay this kind of price for the new company, but I can get a cheaper price for the old companies.
NEUT36|So it's there's a lot of research is confusing and what I always advise people do to do.
NEUT37|Don't take money you can't afford to lose and go to the IPO because you can lose a lot of money here.
NEUT38|There's no guarantee you're going to make money in IPO.
NEUT39|Any other tips that we should know about?
NEUT40|When buying stock, yeah well, but buying stock, make sure again you need to know when you're going to sell it before you buy it.
NEUT41|You need to before you start buying stock.
NEUT42|If you're over 50 years old, you need your own retirement plan.
NEUT43|Your individual retirement plan, and one of the things you need to have is a core plan that is not tide to the stock market.
NEUT44|That will give you lifetime income.
NEUT45|The most happiest people I've ever talked to in retirement and not the ones with big stock value.
NEUT46|So the ones with an income they never worry bout.
NEUT47|Yeah think about that.
BULL48|Lifetime income is a whole lot better than going up and down the market.
BEAR49|There may be losing your money market or making your money in the market 'cause they takes award out of living in retirement.
NEUT50|So it makes you a whole lot more comfortable when you know the incomes coming and that's what we want to be.
NEUT51|Yeah, we call that terminal velocity when we have the same amount of income or more coming for the restaurant life.
NEUT52|We never worry about anything.
BULL53|Again, thank you.
