BULL7|Well, that's up 16% on the week or 15% now 'cause it's kind of pulling back a little bit through the roof.
NEUT8|This big megaphone that you could see it building right in there and at some point.
NEUT9|And what makes the most sense to me, is that if they're looking at a stock market that can look over the Valley, then investors have to be looking at the fact that Amazon's dominance of retail is likely going to slow down or stop.
NEUT10|This huge huge growth from COVID-19 you can see in there is a stock moves up in just five weeks from around 1600 up to 2400, a 50% gain that you see right there and when you look at the market cap of Amazon, well that's the same thing as adding up the next 86 retail stocks.
NEUT11|I mean, it is just nutty.
NEUT12|The representation it has of this entire industry.
BEAR13|Well they have killed the industry.
NEUT14|We know that.
NEUT15|They are now testing all employees.
NEUT16|They're getting ready to open all of their warehouses for the full deliveries where they had closed a lot of it down except for emergency things that are really needed.
NEUT17|It got up to that 100% if extensions and right over there that you can see in that broadening pattern.
NEUT18|What happens is when you top finally in the broadening pattern, you move somewhere down towards the middle of it.
BEAR19|We're projecting yes out into July a pull back to around 2150.
BEAR20|And it could be somewhat worse than that in Amazon.
BEAR21|"So craziness going on here when you see that amount of buying."""
