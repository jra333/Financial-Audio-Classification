NEUT0|"""Man Shapiro president of MWS Capital, brings us the final trade of the day."
BULL1|Good to have you here.
NEUT2|It's been awhile.
BULL3|Thanks Angie.
NEUT4|Don't stay away so long.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at your trade.
BULL6|The day well Netflix which everyone knows had earnings last week.
BEAR7|Pop to about 3:10 then backed off.
NEUT8|You know to the 285 range.
BEAR9|Remember Netflix had a little bit of a disappointing Big Decelean subscriber growth a couple quarters ago.
BEAR10|That's trend, discontinued Stockwell down from its eyes.
BULL11|Finally a rebound with a strong market.
NEUT12|Of yesterday, back threatening that 300 level.
NEUT13|So is this a straight out buy for you or trade or what are you doing here?
NEUT14|Straight out by?
BEAR15|Actually you know we nibbled at some as it had come down in the 280 range it had been actually lower than that.
BULL16|I thought the earnings last week were very good.
BEAR17|Addressed a lot of the subscriber concerns but the stock of course is still very controversial with all the moves of Disney going into streaming and everybody going to streaming.
NEUT18|So yes, however we feel the brand name.
NEUT19|The Bragg.
BULL20|Recognition and the momentum is really there.
BULL21|Netflix has really established itself as a Premier company.
NEUT22|Do you have a target price on this stack?
NEUT23|Well, and you really don't put targets down, but I think you know it can easily with a little bit of a good market hopefully to end the year.
BULL24|Get back to its all time high.
NEUT25|So I'd like to see it in three 3340 range.
NEUT26|Any thoughts on the market before you take off?
NEUT27|Well, who would have thought we'd be right here with all three markets, all three major indexes at or near record highs with all the turbulence that we have right in Washington fears about economic slowdown, low interest rates, Fed, sidelined, who would have thought it.
NEUT28|But, you know, you have to be positive.
NEUT29|And by quality investments.
BULL30|Thanks for coming on the show, man.
NEUT31|Have a great day.
