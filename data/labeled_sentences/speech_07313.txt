NEUT0|"""Hi this is ACMI Redditor spread that magazine where they look at some at U.S. stocks which are currently in focus amongst speculative traders."
NEUT1|Starting off with Facebook where there's been a rising trend channel here since June July, the whole rally that we've had in the recent past kicked off by a massive unfilled gap to the upside just the type of thing you want to see in the biggest and best of stock market rallies.
NEUT2|There's also an RSI uptrend line from.
BULL3|May as well, which is sort of being tested in November and we're holding above the support line there currently and also probably worth noting is the way that we've got the floor of the.
BULL4|2013 price channel, backed up by the 50 day moving average at 50.42 dollars so looking solid.
NEUT5|There are little black bull flag here at the moment.
BULL6|Support above the 20 day moving average at 5398 and really while that 20 day line holds.
BULL7|I'm looking for further progress towards the top of the channel from last year and applied target here as high as $68.
NEUT8|The time frame on such a move probably.
NEUT9|Within the next two to four weeks, moving along to Netflix and here we have possibly a more sort of conservative type of movement here, but still it was started off with an unfilled gap to the upside in April last year so that there has been a sort of a dynamic force behind this rally.
BULL10|And then it's settled into a rising trend channel from June.
NEUT11|Based with the base at the.
NEUT12|Just a day moving average at $352, so solid enough there extended our site support line as well the RSI line around the 40 mark, so holding above that and an implied target as you can see, as high as $400 if you're cautious on the stock would be waiting for an end of day closed back above the 10 day moving average at $369, but it really does not look as though it's worth giving away that much upside to make sure that this positive momentum here really it's easier to buy on dips towards the 50 day line.
BULL13|At $352, the stop loss and ended day close back below 350 would probably do the trick and now we have Twitter, which is arguably the most exciting of the three situations here.
NEUT14|Obviously a lot of speculation as the companies come to market over the last month or two.
BEAR15|Sharp pullback from the initial peak, but I sort of regard this as a sort of U shaped recovery missing that the right hand side of such shape.
BULL16|And expect progress within rising December price channel and that should take take the stock towards $85.
BULL17|Support likely around the 20 day moving average 5986.
BEAR18|So stop loss just below the $60.00 mark.
BULL19|If you're sort of cautious on this, maybe you'd wait for this gap to be filled or end of day close above the gap and above $70.00 to go along, but it looks pretty pretty solid here now after that little flush out maneuver at the end of.
NEUT20|December and I'd be looking for $85 as an end of February target while we hold above 60.
NEUT21|That's it for me.
NEUT22|"See you again next time."""
