BULL0|"""Sure, so I think the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly challenging for Amazon, as the year's been when you think about maximizing revenue and E Commerce to the extent that they're having challenges that their fulfillment centers."
NEUT1|As far as getting in products and out products as quickly as possible.
BULL2|So the hope was having prime day in October would improve their yield at the fulfillment center level and help them maximize sales in the holiday quarter.
BULL3|But I do think this is going to be a challenge for the company.
BULL4|Jessica overall, though clearly the revenue line.
BULL5|Very impressive, up close to 40% year over year and the guide on the revenue line for Q4 better than expected.
NEUT6|Should investors be looking past any short term issues about costs or anything else.
NEUT7|It's a good question.
BEAR8|I mean, we're seeing more than a pandemic tailwind to Amazon's business is important not to lose sight of that.
BEAR9|I mean, they're blowing away on sales numbers even with the very legitimate concerns about fulfillment.
BULL10|So you know, I, I think there's a lot of positive news as well.
BULL11|I think this secular acceleration to online retail is something that you know investors should should really be keeping front of mind in their strategies as well, because we're seeing, even with the headwinds on the fulfillment.
NEUT12|Amazon can blow away on those numbers, but the question is always about, you know, is that baked in and the other expectations.
NEUT13|But I I do think that there you know we shouldn't underestimate just the sectoral shift here to an.
NEUT14|It's hard to see post pandemic on line retail not gaining really meaningful share of Commerce.
NEUT15|What if we gleaned at about about how Amazon views the holiday quarter?
NEUT16|We know that they're going to 100.
NEUT17|They're going to hire 100,000 employees.
BULL18|That was a sign of strength that they announced earlier today.
NEUT19|We're getting the guidance numbers.
NEUT20|How is it shaping up for Amazon?
NEUT21|I think you know the operating income there.
BEAR22|They're looking a little bit lower than probably people were expecting, and I mean there's some covid related expenses going on with that as well.
NEUT23|But you know, if I'm an investor, I want to see them putting more money into fulfillment, putting, you know, hiring more workers for the holiday quarter.
BULL24|I mean, maybe the idea that with the pushback on Prime Day that they you know investors want to see a bigger, even a bigger guidance on the top line.
BULL25|But I agree with Jessica, I think these are pretty stellar numbers all around.
NEUT26|Given given everything and the.
BULL27|The jump up in revenues you know from the covid from Covid.
NEUT28|Basically you know there are household were buying stuff from Amazon all the time, much more than we had in the past.
NEUT29|Because because we're on lockdown.
BULL30|So I actually think this is largely positive story for them.
BULL31|And I think that they're continuing to pump money into operations to fulfillment.
NEUT32|If anything, I want to see them do more of that as an investor rather than, you know, trying to be more conservative.
NEUT33|Tom, what are you looking at for on the call?
NEUT34|So in the column you're looking for, how they're managing the covid related costs we know is 4 billion in the June quarter, and expectations were 2 billion in the September quarter.
BULL35|So to the extent we've seen a surge in cases both in the US in internationally, I look for incremental commentary from management on how they expect to manage covid in the fourth quarter, in addition to all their efforts to maximize fulfillment, both their own delivery efforts and leveraging the Postal Service, FedEx UPS, etc.
BULL36|Tom Forte, thank you very much.
NEUT37|Adam Jessica.
NEUT38|Stay with us.
BULL39|We've got more earnings coming up.
