BEAR0|"""I don't mean to say that what happened wasn't traumatic to end up where we did, middle of nowhere completely cut off from the lives we left behind."
NEUT1|That brings us to the real question, doesn't it?
NEUT2|Who was so great about the lives we left behind?
NEUT3|I feel.
NEUT4|It feels like everywhere I go, somebody's asking me to meet some kind of expectation.
BEAR5|We're stuck here.
NEUT6|This is 21st century.
NEUT7|OK, they will find us.
NEUT8|1,000,000 miles away there was trauma, but being a teenage girl, that was the real living hell.
BEAR9|Death has been hanging over our heads.
NEUT10|And yet the only thing I seem to care about is love.
NEUT11|So that's what we're all afraid of.
NEUT12|Then we won't be loved.
NEUT13|Are we in the actual Bermuda Triangle?
BEAR14|Everything about the island feels off.
NEUT15|What kind of persons using the island of Lost girls doesn't send help?
NEUT16|Your daughter is stepping back from a very dark precipice.
BEAR17|Sometimes I feel guilty that we lied to her.
BULL18|"You did that to save her."""
