BULL3|So that's lighter than I'm sorry about a million smaller than forecast expectations had been for about 6.2 million net additions.

NEUT5|Both international and domestic editions with 600.
BULL6|70,000 new subscribers in the US and less than 4.5 million new subscribers globally now looking at earnings and revenue revenue of 3.907 billion, is just a hair lighter than the 3.94 billion than analysts were expecting.
NEUT7|The quarter EPS coming in at $0.85 per share.
BULL8|That's up from $0.15 in the year ago quarter, but that does include gain in terms of foreign exchange that does include a noncash unrealized gain from foreign exchange RE measurement on your bond, so it's unclear if that's exactly.
BULL9|Apples to apples, so EPS at $0.85 per share.
NEUT10|Revenue at 3.9 billion.
BEAR11|In terms of that guidance, the company is guiding for lower subscriber additions than expected, guiding for Global net adds of about 5,000,000 in Q3 versus analyst projections of about 6,000,000.
