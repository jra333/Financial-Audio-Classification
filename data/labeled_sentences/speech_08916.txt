NEUT0|"""What's up stocks going today?"
NEUT1|We are talking about MOPOWW stuck so if we look at the Church for the last day the stock closed at 683.
NEUT2|And after hours it went to 690.
NEUT3|I think it's going to open even higher than that because if you look at the chart here was on 670.
NEUT4|But also you have to consider one number.
NEUT5|Should we look at next week so there was a resisting point around 709 an around 7:18.
NEUT6|So we want to get past this one.
BULL7|Going to get past this point 17.
NEUT8|Wanna get it 738 747 51 to see these numbers.
NEUT9|Because also we have to be watching for the support.
NEUT10|We have 651.
NEUT11|So we have 651's support or 654 actually and then we have the resistance around 7:18 and 771.
NEUT12|Because if you look at the chart from the five day, yeah, here you'll see here.
BULL13|There was a resistance and then came down to 632, so that's another support point, which is good.
BULL14|So 636 fifty we want to keep above these levels and we want to break through the 7:38 or 7:40 and I think this stock is going to do well in the next few months.
NEUT15|Three months at least.
NEUT16|Or like the longer term 2 is going to hit $8.00.
NEUT17|Nine dollars, $10 per share.
NEUT18|Yeah, it's quite obvious this talk is going to have like a lot potential in the next month.
