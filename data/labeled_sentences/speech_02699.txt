NEUT0|"""We keep watching David for the place that we will see the break, right?"
BEAR1|Because there's been too many weird things.
NEUT2|Too much easy money for too long.
NEUT3|The cycle going on longer than many anticipated.
NEUT4|You're looking at corporate balance sheets, right?
NEUT5|And it's not just where the how the money's been borrowed, but also where is it gone?
NEUT6|And to be one thing, if this whole cycle where we've had over $4 trillion of corporate bond issuance, CODA, finance, capital expenditure, and then you could say, well, we're going to have a productivity cycle.
NEUT7|There's going to be some internally generated rate of return.
NEUT8|That's going to cover these debt servicing costs, right?
NEUT9|That hasn't happened.
BEAR10|This is the weakest capital spending cycle of all time in the context of the biggest **** and core bond issuance of all time.
NEUT11|So where's the money gone?
NEUT12|2 words financial engineering, stock buybacks, stock buybacks, and that helps explain why earnings per share a bit inflated.
NEUT13|And that's the biggest reason why we've had this ongoing very powerful bull market in equities.
BEAR14|In the context of the weakest overall economic recovery of all time.
NEUT15|So it's a symbiotic relationship where you've got this massive corporate bond issuance financing.
NEUT16|Stock buybacks.
NEUT17|And it's a train.
NEUT18|It's really what I call smoke and mirrors, but you're talking specifically your about the spread between, say, Triple C's and double bees.
NEUT19|And you're right, that's what happens.
NEUT20|Is that that's the Canary in the coal mine.
NEUT21|And so I mean when you talk about a game of musical chairs, which is kind of what this is.
NEUT22|Music stop.
NEUT23|Somebody doesn't have a chair.
NEUT24|Who's this somebody in this scenario?
NEUT25|'cause the folks that are the beneficiary of the buybacks are not complaining?
NEUT26|They're very happy to have stock valuations disconnect from the real economy, which is basically what's happened here.
NEUT27|Who could suffer?
NEUT28|Well, I mean, who is holding onto this corporate debt?
NEUT29|So you'd be talking about say it could be.
NEUT30|Pension funds should be mutual funds.
NEUT31|It would be insurance companies and so a gamut of institutional investors.
NEUT32|It's not really a banking issue this time around is always saying, well the banks are in great shape.
NEUT33|It's really about the non bank financial institutions who are holding on to this and then you get the spread widening.
NEUT34|And don't forget that the financial markets are all correlated with each other.
NEUT35|So once you start getting spread winding in one part of the corporate bond market with the lag, it's other parts of the corporate bond market.
BEAR36|It makes funding less iaccessible starts hitting the real economy and that's where the lag tends to hit the stock market.
NEUT37|Remember that the problems in the mortgage market really started about 6 to 12 months before the stock market finally woke up to it back in 2007.
NEUT38|David, what about the fact that some point to financial condition is still being pretty loose?
BULL39|This GTV chart on the Bloomberg showing you the financial conditions remain pretty accommodating as of yet.
NEUT40|So what would you say to traditional?
NEUT41|Economists say this is related to growth.
NEUT42|Well, what's interesting is that financial conditions are are absolutely accommodative.
NEUT43|No question about it.
BEAR44|Why is it, then, that fourth quarter GDP growth looks like it's getting below 1% in annual rate?
NEUT45|I'm doing the bean count on the fourth quarter.
BEAR46|I can't get my numbers above 1%, and then of course we slow down to 2% last quarter.
NEUT47|So economists love to talk about easy financial conditions.
NEUT48|And then these days people tide into, well, financial conditions are easy.
NEUT49|Therefore go buy financial assets.
NEUT50|But the reason why financial conditions are easy is because of the boomerang in financial assets.
NEUT51|The question now it pulls back to you as well as the evidence that this is producing accelerating economic growth.
NEUT52|If anything, I would say when you're taking a look at the broad gamut of numbers, the economy is actually in spider mode right now in the US.
BEAR53|I'm not seeing any signs.
NEUT54|We always see.
BEAR55|The leading indicator is at its lowest level in 10 years.
NEUT56|I'm not seeing anything in the global economy.
NEUT57|Accelerating people tend to get so fixated on one or two months of noise, but the financial conditions aren't stimulating the economy.
NEUT58|I mean, if you're talking about financial conditions, negative interest rates you'd be looking at boom conditions in Europe right now.
NEUT59|If anything you're looking the German economy, which is the engine of Europe.
NEUT60|It's barely growing, so the financial conditions, the stimulus they are might be giving you an impulse.
NEUT61|"If you're an investor to go along risk, but it's doing nothing for real economic activity."""
