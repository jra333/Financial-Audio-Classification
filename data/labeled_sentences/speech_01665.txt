BULL0|"""I think first and foremost, if we're looking at the communication side of this company and this industry, there should have been a good amount of tailwinds to support revenue growth."
BULL1|And as has been pointed out a couple of times they've managed to preserve margins because they cut costs, which is great that they got ahead of it and they were able to have that flexibility, but not just Disney.
NEUT2|A lot of other companies did the same, and they cut costs to support their margins a lot of times you have to spend money to make money, so if companies are looking to grow going forward that cost cutting becomes a thing of the past and they're going to need the revenue support.
NEUT3|To make up for it.
NEUT4|So I think in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, we really need the top line to come back and investors are going to scrutinize that much more closely than they are with the second quarter earnings season.
BEAR5|Because the expectations that are just so low here, I don't know that there are a lot of stocks that are going to get punished for some of these minor misses.
NEUT6|Liz Ann Lindsey.
BULL7|"Thank you both for joining us."""
