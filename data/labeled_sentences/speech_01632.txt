NEUT0|"""We start with one overcharged OK, first of all, if you refer to an analyzer, since the price was within this move exactly within this one we mentioned how we can look for by the other one opportunity to look for buy here and the second opportunity here."
NEUT1|OK so you can see there is a continuation.
NEUT2|First of all we start with the daily chart.
NEUT3|OK, as you can see this on daily chart.
NEUT4|After we get this correction we see the price continue know once you how high this one can go mostly we can expect the current together.
BEAR5|One more correction for continuation OK either from here or higher that's why.
NEUT6|I mean if based on lower time frame, if you want to look for BI, we need to at least have the proper.
NEUT7|Management OK, and in this case we move to forward chart based on forward chart.
BULL8|Also we see the continuation and we had a correction here.
NEUT9|That's why from here or higher we can expect a correction for continuity and this is the best if you get a correction the next continue can give us a better confirmation.
NEUT10|Alright and I want to see how we can trade it.
NEUT11|As explained my last video from now, and I mean if you want to look for by we can look for correction and continuation similar to any of this.
NEUT12|OK, any if we get the correction is still we can look for by an as long as we get into the profit we start to manage.
NEUT13|This is the only way we can look for trade.
NEUT14|Any short movie The flag we can look for trade this is I mean how we going to treat OK this is what we're going to expect but the only thing is.
NEUT15|We wait for the Connect correction.
NEUT16|We take the trade as long as we get into the profit we start to manage and then we look if we get the second opportunity.
NEUT17|Also we can trade but the only things is how high it can go.
NEUT18|We cannot come form.
NEUT19|And for this, especially for BT, all right, because as we can see if we refer to the chart in the right now we are based on the highest price.
NEUT20|The only things is any trade we get we.
NEUT21|I mean any traits that we get betrayed an the only thing says whatever the trade.
BULL22|We have it we have to at least manage more words of loss to break even in case there is a sharp move for the reversal.
NEUT23|OK the only thing says any trait we get we consider as a short time.
NEUT24|As long as we get into profit we start to manage similar to any of this.
NEUT25|Is how we can trade and in this case we just follow the chart.
BULL26|"If I see any update any changes then I will share thanks."""
