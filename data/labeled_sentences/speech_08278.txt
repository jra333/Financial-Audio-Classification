NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, overall a nice move here on Apple.
BEAR5|Still a lot of work that needs to be done, but I mean you something about the fact how the price had the gap down.
BULL6|The price was sitting down here for quite awhile and then ultimately was able to work its way all the way up to that area.
NEUT7|A good solid bounce, but that does bring about the valid question of OK, yeah it was a nice bounce today, but I mean is it really?
NEUT8|Is there actually any sort of true bounce behind this movement?
NEUT9|Or is this just some sort of dead cat bounce?
NEUT10|You know, knee jerk, reaction type thing and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward in my mind intervals on a single area.
NEUT12|In that area is right here at $120.00.
NEUT13|Why is 120 important?
NEUT14|And I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT15|Saying if the price were to come down here to 120 behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT16|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside this big old range that it just broke out of.
NEUT17|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that, but also to be fair, no price can just go straight up either.
NEUT18|So maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner, then starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT19|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there.
NEUT20|You have loads right there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $120.00.
NEUT23|If the price does continue on up next key area.
NEUT24|Resistance to watch very closely going to be right up there at one 2150 and then after one 2150, you'll want to watch that pink line, which on my chart to know it's a very one of the very famous 200.
NEUT25|Moving average.
NEUT26|Currently valid.
NEUT27|It will just call it one.
NEUT28|2275.
NEUT29|So no doubt about it.
BULL30|Very nice recovery from the lows today.
BULL31|Good solid bounds.
NEUT32|I mean is there any sort of true power behind this bounce?
NEUT33|Let's see how things play out next week and see if the pricing starts to show some signs of progress.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL38|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT44|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up.
