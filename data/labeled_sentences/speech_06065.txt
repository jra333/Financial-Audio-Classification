NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol SRNE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, the chart is certainly looking a little shaky here, but you also can't go as far as saying the entire charts destroyed either, because the price does still have opportunities to show some signs of progress.
NEUT5|When I'll show exactly what I mean by that, what I do want to do here is just give the price a little bit more wiggle room.
NEUT6|So I'm going to move this green line.
NEUT7|That key level of support down to the 590 mark an when I say the price does still have, you know.
NEUT8|In all possibility of showing signs of progress, what do I mean?
NEUT9|And I'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but for example, say if the price were to come down to that 590 mark behave like that and then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT10|What would you have while you have a set of those right here?
BEAR11|You have those lows down there.
NEUT12|If you envision each one of those stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT13|Well, from the big picture, you'd still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward struction.
NEUT14|And that's what truly strong moves are going to over extended periods of time.
BULL15|They're going to show signs of progress and again in this situation, the quote unquote sign of progress would be by staying up above 590.
NEUT16|Now the reason I say the chart does look a little sketchy is 'cause the price is actually getting close to this area, and if it gets close and gets down there and then breaks down to the downside, what would you have all of a sudden?
NEUT17|Well, now you have the price having gone.
NEUT18|Right back to where it was and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT19|But when price movements go back to where they were, that's not exactly sound true.
NEUT20|Power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT21|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to actually happen, I'm just trying to explain why that 590 mark is very important, because sure, the prices or exchange of the chart is looking a little shaky here.
BULL22|The price is getting near that 590 mark.
BULL23|But to be fair, the price does still have that opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT24|So let's see if the price can do that.
NEUT25|Now, if the price starts to work its way back upwards as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
BEAR26|Pretty area resistance right there at 6:35.
NEUT27|Next level up there right around $6.80, so keep an eye on those couple areas moving forward.
NEUT28|But All in all, yeah little sketchy looking sharp, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around.
NEUT29|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including.
BULL32|How I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT38|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live.
