NEUT0|"""Alright guys, what's up it's your boy will back in the video today."
NEUT1|Today I will be talking about check Cap check Cap, stock, ticker symbol, CHD K stock and I'll be giving you guys my analyst and predictions on this stock in the stock market and also some key levels that I'm looking at.
NEUT2|So make sure you guys like the video.
NEUT3|Hit best describe button and turn those post notifications so you don't miss any updates, OK?
NEUT4|So this was a support level, right?
NEUT5|Here's Price was coming up that I thought was support buying pressure.
NEUT6|This level was at $1.73 cents and as you can tell this low, the low will come up here.
BEAR7|That lower came in $1.71.
NEUT8|Rejected that, like I thought it would, and shot higher, right?
NEUT9|So if you just want to have this level on there.
NEUT10|When I told you guys this would support, that would have been.
BULL11|That'll be over 13% gain, which is very good and a day, so that would have been an easy play right there.
BEAR12|And that was coming back down.
NEUT13|So we need to see how it holds this level up around that 173 area and if it doesn't hold that level up and it starts dropping right here and this would be our next of defense right there, right?
NEUT14|And this red line is the last defense at $1.54 and if you are new whenever I say last defense, that just means if the price breaks below this level then I turn short term bearish, OK?
BULL15|And I am holding this stock strong.
NEUT16|I do think it wants to take off is just waiting.
NEUT17|Maybe for some news or profits or anything that's going on I think is waiting right now.
NEUT18|It did have that pop up but it came back down so I think it might come back in this area or it might take off from here right?
NEUT19|We don't really know.
NEUT20|It is like kind of the same price like after hours so it's not really dropping too low after this price right here.
NEUT21|But just watch it right here.
NEUT22|When it falls down an if it breaks that 174 level, it might want to come down to that around the 165 area.
NEUT23|But really, in this area right here, that's OK if price comes down here, that's fine.
BEAR24|That's still bullish to go higher.
NEUT25|But the only level we really want to watch is below this level.
NEUT26|At $1.50, four cents.
BEAR27|Now if this starts breaking down there, then I think it might drop well below.
NEUT28|Probably to a dollar and then I probably won't be in the stock anymore, but as long as they hold these two levels it can train down here something like this.
NEUT29|It could trace highways in this area and then start going higher.
NEUT30|Would be fine.
NEUT31|I am holding this stock longer term an if it comes down in here I'll probably get more shares 'cause that's how bullish I am on the stock.
NEUT32|But if it starts going higher then I'll just hold the shares that we already have that letter.
NEUT33|You guys that we bought in.
NEUT34|Make sure you guys check out the Discord link down below, and so that's how we planned this talk.
NEUT35|OK, so tomorrow if it comes down here, I'll be buying more, but if it starts going higher I'll just be holding it and I am putting this longer term.
NEUT36|OK, hope you guys like the video and this recommendation to buy.
NEUT37|So anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT38|So do not trade anything you see or hear in these videos.
NEUT39|"They catch you guys in the next one."""
