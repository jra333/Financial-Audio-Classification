BULL0|"""We think that by having our own finance arm, you know, and as we brand that into alignment with our platform, that's going to help us establish that same relationship with our customers."
NEUT1|And is there.
NEUT2|Is there a benefit to us from a revenue model?
NEUT3|Absolutely.
NEUT4|But there's also a tremendous difference when it comes down to margins.
NEUT5|So now you're taking the product.
NEUT6|Typically that you would be giving up.
NEUT7|Anywhere from 2020 to 20 to 24% of the gross profit.
NEUT8|Now you're now internalising that bye bye for the financing on your room.
NEUT9|Second thing is that you can actually.
NEUT10|Better understand the residual of these used vehicles and how that applies the lending and financing, especially on the used car leasing side.
BULL11|So, but being able to control that internally and then offer the right protection, products things like, you know, residual guarantee, etc allows us to be more competitive when it comes to financing options, especially when it comes to leasing used vehicles.
NEUT12|So that's why we went that route of acquiring Musaad and why we're so excited about rolling out into the platform.
NEUT13|So you're absolutely right, as there are tremendous vintage to having your own quote unquote captive, you will absolutely.
BULL14|And we were starting to see the benefits of it.
NEUT15|Hit the statement.
NEUT16|But what's really going to be exciting is when we start to scale that out.
NEUT17|What's in, especially when we start to scale those offerings around our own inventory inventory?
NEUT18|That's coming into our eyes and our balance sheet that's coming due.
NEUT19|So we start retail out of our own cars.
NEUT20|Our own fleet only split if you will.
NEUT21|Things are going to get really exciting for us, and that's going to be coming this fall, so.
NEUT22|You know, I'd like to put some numbers around that, but we're still kind of developing what we think the take rate and what the condition of the vehicles are going to be.
BULL23|"But if it's anything anywhere like we're thinking, it's going to be very good for us."""
