BEAR0|"""A debt in your car would probably make you feel miserable."
NEUT1|But event took in might be the cryptocurrency.
BULL2|There might be able to change your life for the better.
NEUT3|In this video I will show you a cryptocoin that has gone bananas lately.
NEUT4|If it's your first time here, you would like to be one of the first to be informed by new coins that are coming out.

NEUT6|I also make videos on stocks and other cool investments to my regular viewers.
NEUT7|What's up?
NEUT8|Welcome back with that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT9|Let's talk money.
NEUT10|Have you ever traveled before?
BEAR11|It's likely you probably experienced the annoyance of either having bad phone signal or expensive roaming fees.
NEUT12|Here's where Dent comes in.
NEUT13|According to their website, Dan has developed a global marketplace for the buying and selling of telco acids such as SIM cards, mobile data packages and voice minutes.
NEUT14|They provide customers with the most convenient ways of staying online while traveling.
NEUT15|No more expensive roaming fees as their model currently then holds.
NEUT16|The 72nd largest market cap with a market cap well approximately $1.2 billion.
NEUT17|Let's take a look at how the price of Dent has fluctuated.
NEUT18|Surprisingly, dance all time high actually happened a really long time ago.
BULL19|On January 9th, 2018, ten was trained as high as $0.11.
NEUT20|After that, there was a nasty debt, and since then Dan hasn't even come close to that price again.
BEAR21|If you would have bought down in 2019, you have likely played under 0.2 cents on March 13, 2020, then sent an all time low of 0.007 cents.
NEUT22|In other words, you could have bought approximately 140 coins at the cost of just one penny.
NEUT23|The rest of 2020 was fairly quiet.
NEUT24|It wasn't really into early 2021 when Dan really started to skyrocket.
BULL25|On March 22nd, 2021, Dan reached the price of 1 cent for the first time in almost three years at the time of recording Dankers Train at 1.2 cents.
NEUT26|As you can see, this coin is extremely volatile.
BULL27|Then it's up 50%.
BULL28|In the past 24 hours, up 289%.
BULL29|In the past week and up 18,000%.
BEAR30|Since hitting the all time low about a year ago.
NEUT31|Quick reminder, I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT32|You should always do your own due diligence.
NEUT33|This coin is growing exponentially, so eventually there will be a big correction when that will happen is almost impossible to predict in my opinion.
NEUT34|If you're going in on this play, it's best to go in for the long run.
NEUT35|I probably buy in slower, just in case there is a correction.
NEUT36|So where do you in by that corner Coinmarketcap.
NEUT37|The following are a few of the crypto exchanges where you are able to purchase that.
NEUT38|Finance, uni, Swap and kucoin.
NEUT39|This one has a ton of room to run and has some revolutionary idea that does help solve a real world problem, but I'm going to try to stay a bit conservative.
NEUT40|"By the end of 2021, I think that will be trained at three cents on the lower end, or five cents on the higher end."""
