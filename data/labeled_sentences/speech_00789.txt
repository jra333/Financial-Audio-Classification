NEUT0|"""Talk through what happened at about 12:18 today to see 350 bucks become 170 bucks on GameStop."
BEAR1|That was a really strange and really unusual well.
NEUT2|It was usual for GameStop, but for the rest of the market, Caroline that was a pretty wild swing.
NEUT3|I mean, we saw a retracement of about 50% in a matter of minutes for GameStop.
NEUT4|That move was reversed.
NEUT5|You know there was a whole to know there was a reversal of the move, so the shares ended up being higher on the day and try to just start saying that more swings like this could continue with the money.
NEUT6|From stimulus checks being mailed in the neck and Lena, do we have evidence that that's going to happen?
NEUT7|Is there as soon as someone sort of track this and figured out how much of that stimulus money could potentially go into the stock market?
NEUT8|So take a look at what Deutsche Bank found out.
NEUT9|They say that as much as 150 billion could be going into the stock market after those stimulus checks get mailed.
NEUT10|That's about close to 9% of the entire stimulus package.
NEUT11|1.9 trillion stimulus package.
NEUT12|So that could obviously be a big influence on the stock market, and you know, guess what?
NEUT13|The game stops the emcees of the world could be the stocks that could see the biggest swings and we.
NEUT14|Clearly saw that today and what Deutsche Bank is saying and what JP Morgan is actually saying is that we could see the repetition of the events that happened in December when retail traders got their stimulus checks and then put that money into the stock market.
BEAR15|And that's when we saw really violent swings that Atlanta was over the news.
BULL16|"Amazing."""
