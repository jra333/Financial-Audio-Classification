NEUT0|"""How's it going?"
NEUT1|Everybody's doing it right here in table to look at OBS lenoble on therapeutics.
BULL2|Great Dave Lewis went up $6.67, just shy of 415% curling season 805 right here.
NEUT3|But the high today was up there at 1077, so go ahead and make that deal guideline to represent the high of the day.
NEUT4|View App is so don't be surprised if we get all dip back down view after threat 679 we always do with this stack we had.
NEUT5|It was a nice stairstep of premarket.
NEUT6|We did let you guys know in the Patriot around 3:25 I was at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.
BULL7|It was on the watch list so and also it was our member who pointed this one out and it was a good good call.
BULL8|He's he's up well over probably 200%.
NEUT9|I would say you bought the city bar at the open so.
NEUT10|Translation is you guys and knows a lot of people that making some money per in the stock market today.
BULL11|So right here at 978 there is going to be more resistance as well as the $9 level and the 8:50 now with this heading into the future I would like it to stay above the $7.00 bigger picture and maybe there was an offering.
NEUT12|Stay up a 5 bucks you guys have to remember yesterday's low was $1.56 so there's going to be a lot of price action.
BULL13|Up or down the highest spike we had.
NEUT14|In the past.
NEUT15|Year was too.
NEUT16|$3.14 So once we broke that level this morning, there was really no turning back.
BULL17|Earnings were good back in November.
BEAR18|Negative, $0.20 better than the last quarters, which is always good.
NEUT19|They always say the company is headed in the right direction with the good news on it today with the merger.
NEUT20|Will go in that in a second I'm assuming that there was a split right here and click on it.
NEUT21|It was a one for 10 split so the price is adjusted.
NEUT22|The stock wasn't $57.
NEUT23|Now I always say how reliable are these all these stack?
NEUT24|Anne.
NEUT25|You know adjusted prices.
NEUT26|I never found them to be quite accurate, but I guess if we do break the high the day 1077, the next step would be probably 1111 and 1153.
NEUT27|It was 13, so there's plenty of room to make money on the stock even if you're going to short it.
BEAR28|'cause I do feel like there's going to be a pullback tomorrow, and if there's not, I don't think that would be good for the overall price action.
NEUT29|And there's not a pullback tomorrow.
NEUT30|Just be honest with you guys if you don't want to PD pump, you want any stair step climb so rare at news broke.
BULL31|Obla Obalon Therapeutics shares trading higher after company announced.
BULL32|A merger agreement with the Reshape Life Sciences Life Sciences.
NEUT33|So with any merger that's going to be big news and we actually know.
NEUT34|Obviously we saw here today.
BULL35|And then you have overall market news as well and with the inauguration today, I was thinking that the stock market was going to be a little more wack but ended up almost making new highs and it found it did in the on the NASDAQ.
NEUT36|So what to stay ahead.
NEUT37|Roughly new presidential and how the whole overall stock market is going to play out and then each individual stock like OBS line.
NEUT38|I don't think it'll be a problem with that.
NEUT39|And 1077 is a nice nice play from $1.56, so again, graduations to you guys in the Patreon.
