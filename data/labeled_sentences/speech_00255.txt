NEUT0|"""Hello want let's take look at the Apple stock price we can see here today."
NEUT1|Apple has formed a green candle.
BULL2|This green candle even though it has jumped 0.72%.
NEUT3|But we can see this candle as well below the five days.
NEUT4|Umm so it's not.
BULL5|Not a bullish sign, but it's a constructive side.
NEUT6|We can see from the volume here.
BEAR7|The volume is low compared to the normal trading volume, so it's still a consolidation.
BEAR8|So as long as the volume keeps low, I can see there's no interesting from the institutions fire.
NEUT9|And also we can see today's market still not the leader.
BEAR10|Apple has been away from the position for a long time.
NEUT11|Roughly from here, roughly from the early September.
BULL12|So the rotation of the sector is healthy for the whole market, but it means people need some fundamental thing to push it higher.
NEUT13|We can see it from the volume here.
BEAR14|The volume has decreased a lot, roughly from the 9th of November.
NEUT15|There's no accumulation.
NEUT16|Can be.
NEUT17|Inspected here, I don't think there's a community different from the institutions because we can see the price.
BEAR18|Nearly no more, and the volume is so low.
NEUT19|But the rotation of the sectors need the.
BULL20|Jump of the tech tech stock for today so it's a 0.7 so this rotation is still going on so tomorrow here may be a red candle, but well above the yummies.
NEUT21|So in my opinion I call is not.
NEUT22|I buy and I think at this moment if you hold the Apple, you can hold it.
NEUT23|But it will not go higher sharply, is still in a consolidation, is a long consolidation.
NEUT24|We can see here.
NEUT25|So hold your stock or consider to sell it, because there's no momentum.
BULL26|"Thank you."""
