BULL0|"""We're showing the shares of Disney and now pretty much the highs of the day."
BEAR1|There were just over $130 a share for the first time since February.
NEUT2|On news.
NEUT3|This hour that third points.
NEUT4|Dan Loeb has taken a new position in the second quarter in Disney along with Amazon, Alibaba and JD Pete.
NEUT5|I'll go to you first for your final trade as we continue to reflect on this news.
NEUT6|We're learning an awfully well known investor and a really good one at that.
BULL7|Taking a new position in Disney and very high on that company's prospects.
BULL8|Especially as it relates to that streaming opportunity which he calls the biggest ever for that company.
NEUT9|Right, and that's obviously the focus that everybody was looking at, and that was the interpretation.
NEUT10|And that's why the stock went where it was.
NEUT11|The interesting thing was on Monday, Scott.
NEUT12|They were buying a call spread that was about $5 out of the money at the time.
NEUT13|All that really means is somebody was speculating that the stock actually could get up towards 128.
NEUT14|Here we are now we're at 1:30.
NEUT15|So what I liked and why I'm using Disney as my final trade is they're buying next weeks 132 strike calls so you know what you can't fight him.
NEUT16|You got to join him, and it looks like it's going higher.
BULL17|Yeah, appreciate that Brenda quickly from you please.
BULL18|Yep.
NEUT19|You're looking to diversify away from technology.
BULL20|Honeywell is a great high quality industrial company with a diverse revenue stream.
NEUT21|Farmer Jim.
BULL22|Alaska Airlines doesn't need the government support, but it will benefit from it.
BULL23|OK, that stock up so slightly, Josh.
NEUT24|Lastly to you.
BEAR25|Store capital earnings are out.
BULL26|"They are performing very well now collecting 85% of rents up from 65 in April."""
