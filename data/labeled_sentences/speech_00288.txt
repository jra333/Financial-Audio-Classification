BEAR0|"""How bad will GDP be?"
BEAR1|And because of furloughs because of of aid to companies, do you expect an ugly number?
BULL2|But the economy to actually become much better as soon as lockdown is over?
NEUT3|Yeah, I think perhaps the speed of the recovery will be critically dependent upon how how people feel about this.
NEUT4|You know, I think the psychological element is definitely an important element and we have seen past crises such as the 2011 euro crisis.
BEAR5|I would argue that was a crisis of confidence.
NEUT6|So so sentiment is is yet another moving part in in this whole equation.
NEUT7|I would perhaps look at the WTO, the World Trade Organization's forecast for trade volumes this year.
BEAR8|They think that merchandise trade will fall somewhere between 13 and 32%, so they're two.
NEUT9|We see that the range of forecasts is just unprecedented in this.
NEUT10|Of course, historic moment.
BEAR11|But if we compare that with 2008, one trade fell about 10% and the Great Depression one trade fell about 60%.
BEAR12|We can conclude that it will probably be worse than a 2008 crisis, but possibly not as bad as our worst fears.
BEAR13|And so, how much worse than oh wait, is it employment?
NEUT14|Is that companies actually going bust?
NEUT15|What are you looking at in terms of measures that make it?
BEAR16|You know that make this recession so much deeper than what we saw in 0809.
NEUT17|Right, so I certainly don't want to trivialize unemployment and the hardship that that imposes on everybody concerned, but the effort, of course, with all these support packages, is to replace the lost income.
BULL18|So if that actually happens, I think the size of the measures is obviously again unprecedented and also comes with promises of more measures.
NEUT19|If that should be needed.
NEUT20|So the issue seems to be on the bureaucracy side and how quickly the money can.
NEUT21|Reach the people who really need it so that we can limit the loss of productive capacity.
NEUT22|So replace incomes and and also prevent bankruptcies.
BEAR23|That's obviously the challenge here and it will critically depend on how long this goes on for the longer it goes on, the more dangerous it is that you know the model, the higher the risk that we actually do lose some productive capacity which could limit the rebound along with whatever damage this all does to our.
NEUT24|You know to our sentiment going forward, how quickly we dare to go out and do what we used to do.
NEUT25|Another somewhat encouraging number, times I find is there the time.
NEUT26|Sorry.
NEUT27|No, go ahead Marie.
BEAR28|Yeah, the Chinese trade data for the month of March, which was bad because obviously exports fell by 6.6%, but that was less than half.
BEAR29|Sorry of the expected fall expectations were in the line of minus 14% and imports to drop to barely a percent compared to expectations close to 10%.
NEUT30|So to the extent that this.
NEUT31|"You know can be taken at face value, although one number is always, you know, not necessarily a trend, but it does suggest that I think what I was saying earlier that that that our worst fears might not be realized."""
