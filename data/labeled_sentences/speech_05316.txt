NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol NIO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Now this video will mean a little bit more of those you that watch the video I did on Monday, but even if you did it, you know I talked about.
NEUT5|That pink line there being a key level of resistance talked about that purple line being a key level of support, but I mean check this out.
NEUT6|You just can't make this stuff up.
NEUT7|Maybe I'm easily impressed, but like I said, talked about that pink line and look right where the price struggled all day long.
NEUT8|Literally right there at the pink line.
NEUT9|Now I don't say that in a bearish sense in the in meaning or now the price is going to totally collapse.
NEUT10|I don't mean that at all.
NEUT11|I'm just saying that you know, This is why charts.
NEUT12|Nothing is perfect.
NEUT13|So I'm not saying that testimony listen charts are the perfect tool.
NEUT14|But are they a tool that you should understand that you should have in your tool belt?
NEUT15|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT16|And here is just a fantastic example of that.
NEUT17|And like I said, if you want the full experience, I guess you can call it.
NEUT18|Just go back and watch a video I did on this one on April 5th and you'll see exactly what I talked about, but more of the story here from kind of the practical sense now moving forward.
NEUT19|It's still all about that pink line that remains that very stubborn level of resistance, so keep a close eye on that and as of right now.
NEUT20|Will call that's value at the $40 mark if the price does push up through the $40 area.
NEUT21|The next key level to watch very closely would then be up there around $40.65.
NEUT22|So continue to watch those main levels as resistance again.
NEUT23|First key level that 200.
NEUT24|Moving average at 40 next key level up there at 4065 as far as levels of support concern, continue to watch the purple and right there.
NEUT25|The 50.
NEUT26|Moving average, which as of right now is valued.
NEUT27|Whoops, let me get my cursor out of the way.
NEUT28|You can see right there, valued at $39.50 so watch.
NEUT29|That is the main level of support.
NEUT30|But All in all, those are going to be the main dynamics moving forward.
NEUT31|So to give credit credits, do you know an I always trying to breakthrough that level of resistance all day long?
NEUT32|Couldn't quite do it, but we'll see if they can finally get the job done on Wednesday.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL36|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT42|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live.
