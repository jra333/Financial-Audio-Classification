NEUT0|"""Welcome to The Newsroom."
NEUT1|Alright, so I'm going to do a quick two minute technical analysis on Ale Ale.
BEAR2|Everything else is tumbling details almost back to its all time highs.
NEUT3|Here we go.
NEUT4|Alright, so I'm going to draw my first line of support at three.
BULL5|Oh 678 it got through that area.
NEUT6|If you look I have these two red boxes I drew you got through the one on the left which was a major resistance test and got through the one on the right.
BULL7|Another major resistance test.
NEUT8|So now it's above that area.
NEUT9|So now.
NEUT10|It has a great floor as little floor to walk along.
NEUT11|What's next?
NEUT12|Where can Apple go?
BULL13|It has a great level support.
BULL14|If the market stays strong, even if it shows a little weakness.
NEUT15|Apple still gonna do its thing.
NEUT16|I have a first price target test of 326 that was its previous highs in February before the Rona crash and you could see Apple did that quick V recovery.
NEUT17|That's what the market was supposed to do, but something happened an it's the market that would.
NEUT18|And then flatline died.
NEUT19|Alright.
BULL20|Needs to wake back up and continue trending up.
NEUT21|So obviously it's not going to go shoot straight through 326.
NEUT22|It's going to little squiggly action.
NEUT23|I just little squiggle squiggle it's going to shop around, so don't be nervous if it doesn't hit it right away and it goes down.
NEUT24|That sell stocks move.
NEUT25|They're going to go up and down.
BULL26|It broke through support.
NEUT27|It's safe to buy Apple if the market stays strong.
NEUT28|Or like I said, if they show a little bit a little bit of weakness, it's OK. That's a quick two minute technical analysis for you on Apple.
NEUT29|"Don't forget to retire, yeah?"""
