BULL0|"""Have affected this have on on Disney stop Joe thanks so much."
NEUT1|Well it's kind of it's a classic.
NEUT2|What we say is do you sell on the news?
NEUT3|I mean people have known that this is coming but look this is a huge event and it's really captured both the adults and the children.
NEUT4|At Christmas time.
NEUT5|I mean this to me.
NEUT6|I I. I'd be betting on the positive side of this.
NEUT7|Even though the market I've had emails from many, many money managers is saying you know what?
NEUT8|I've owned it for awhile and maybe it's all in the stock and they've made a lot of money on its own, so it's been a few days.
NEUT9|Well, he just keeps his prove that he's no Grinch, that he's no screwed.
BULL10|But he does have a beating heart and then 'cause that was a very optimistic positive.
NEUT11|Some stocks like McDonald's.
NEUT12|That's right, he likes America to keep Grinch side, though if you look you see Disney has had a wonderful year.
BEAR13|Hasbro's done very well 'cause of all these toys sales, and about a week or two weeks ago they started pulling back at.
NEUT14|I think it was kind of sell the news 'cause everyone knew there was so much hype around this.
BULL15|Now the good news is for Disney it might actually be achieving and maybe even exceeding the hype.
NEUT16|We sent a barons Reporter on Tuesday night and he came back and then raise about the movie and he's a cynical guy.
NEUT17|He loved it.
NEUT18|The expectations from analysts from Wall Street analysts capable love this they're up there, but they're not as high as this.
NEUT19|This box office could go right?
NEUT20|They're not expecting this to be the highest grossing movie of all time, which is still avatar.
NEUT21|I think it's almost $2.8 billion.
NEUT22|It could easily exceed that if you get repeat business easily.
BULL23|And I don't think people they're trying to couch it and say oh, it's going to be like third in terms of global box office **********.
NEUT24|Yeah, when you look, you look at the stock, I mean it ripped to 120 before all this kind of was.
BEAR25|You know, headline news had a huge correction all the way to 96 and now it's at 112.
NEUT26|That was that involved.
NEUT27|A lot of media and you have.
NEUT28|That's the other thing about Disney.
NEUT29|You have ESPN.
BEAR30|You have the Disney Parks yesterday, announcing that they're effectively in more of a lockdown situation than they've been because of the terrorist events.
NEUT31|I mean, there's a lot to think about when you think about the Disney stock, so you can't just day trade it based on how the movie flows.
NEUT32|Although again, I'd be bullishly biased on the movie flow.
NEUT33|"Alright, sure, break, coming up."""
