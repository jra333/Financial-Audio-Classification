BEAR0|"""In a surprise move yesterday, Republican leaders ditched the idea of a payroll tax holiday."
BEAR1|This is a big mistake.
BEAR2|It will hurt a vulnerable economy that needs all the help it can get.
NEUT3|I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
NEUT4|Will we give you the insights you need to navigate an ever more turbulent world?
NEUT5|Well, they've done it.
BEAR6|Republicans have abandoned the idea of a payroll tax holiday.
BEAR7|This at a time when new applications for jobless benefits rose this week for the first time in nearly four months, employers are getting cautious because of the rise in covid cases.
BEAR8|And some states are rolling back are delaying their reopening plans many smaller businesses.
BEAR9|Running out of cash and face bankruptcy.
BEAR10|The Federal Reserve's Main Street lending program, which was supposed to provide life saving loans to small and medium sized businesses, is stalled because lending conditions are too tough.
BULL11|The payroll tax suspension would have been a powerful tonic.
NEUT12|A person making $40,000 a year would enjoy an annual take home pay raise of $3000 tax free for somebody making $50,000.
NEUT13|The number would have been almost $4000.
BULL14|For employers, the savings would have come at a critical time.
BEAR15|The cost of keeping workers would have gone down immediately by over 7%.
BEAR16|The cost of hiring a new person would go down by over 7% positive incentives all around.
NEUT17|You wouldn't need a new program or have to go through bureaucratic procedures.
NEUT18|Just don't collect the tax simple and powerful.
BEAR19|The absence of this powerful stimulant will mean bad job reports and both September and October a slowing economy.
NEUT20|Could well create the conditions for the election of Joe Biden and a Democrat Congress.
BEAR21|The resulting storm of higher taxes and massive government intrusions into businesses would trigger a frightening economic disaster.
BEAR22|Unfortunately, the new stimulus bill is shaping up as a big spending dud that would not help get the economy back on its feet.
NEUT23|For now, it looks like the White House wants any deal it can get.
NEUT24|Sometimes however, no deal is better than a defective deal.
NEUT25|Swan is shaping up as one of those.
NEUT26|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT27|Thank you for listening.
NEUT28|"Do send in your comments and suggestions and I look forward to seeing you next time."""
