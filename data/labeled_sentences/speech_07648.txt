NEUT0|"""Breaking Bad premiered last week and more than 5.9 million people tuned in."
NEUT1|That's roughly four times the number of people who tried meth last year.
NEUT2|None of those 5.9 million Breaking Bad viewers, not meth.
NEUT3|Dabblers of those 5.9 million Breaking Bad viewers, it turns out Warren Buffett is one of them.
NEUT4|The guy said that he is a big fan of the show and that the lead character Walter White is an excellent businessman.
NEUT5|That got us thinking.
NEUT6|What if Warren Buffett decided to break bad?
NEUT7|How good would he be doing that?
NEUT8|First off, let's take a look at the Warren Buffet of the drug world.
NEUT9|His name is Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.
NEUT10|He's the world's most successful drug trafficker.
NEUT11|The Rand Institute estimates that Guzman's Sinaloa cartel makes about 3 billion a year.
NEUT12|That's a lot of scratch, but that's paltry compared to Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT13|Their revenue was 162 billion in 2012.
NEUT14|That's about Â£10 million of meth, according to the going rate in Omaha.
NEUT15|Don't ask us how we know that on Forbes list of the world's billionaires, Warren Buffett sits pretty at #4 with a net worth of 53.5 billion, whereas Guzman is all the way down the list.
NEUT16|With a net worth of just $1 billion, of course, not all addictions are bad, and Warren Buffett has a few to thank for his success, like his long term addiction to Coke, Cherry, Coke.
NEUT17|That is right, the Coca Cola stock in particular has been a long time holding of Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL18|They bought in the late 80s and it's paid off to the tune of $13 billion.
NEUT19|Not too shabby.
NEUT20|A second addiction of Warren Buffett's is to invest in businesses that have cornered their markets like Gus Fring did with his wildly successful.
NEUT21|Fried chicken chain, Lowe's, polios, hermanos.
NEUT22|Of course.
NEUT23|Buffett doesn't invest in companies that are fronts for major methamphetamine rings.
NEUT24|He likes companies like Costco or GEICO.
NEUT25|These companies have absolutely cornered their respective and legitimate and legitimate industries.
NEUT26|So what's the takeaway here?
NEUT27|Well, as Breaking Bad has taught us, being a successful drug trafficker is illegal.
NEUT28|Dangerous may involve dissolving a corpse in your bathtub or vehicular homicide, but investing involves none of these things.
BULL29|"They understand to make a lot more money and we can look to Warren Buffett's proof of that."""
