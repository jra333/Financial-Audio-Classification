NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, Michael's investing here real quick I'm just talking about Warren Buffett annual letter that came out today and he said never bet against America."
NEUT1|So a few of the quick talking points are it's the 6th largest company in the US Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT2|They sold some of their shares of Apple.
NEUT3|They own around 5.4% of Apple.
NEUT4|British sold around.
BEAR5|Little bit less than half of a percent of Apple, so they have been trimming that Apple is actually half of their overall investment value and a fourth of their market cap is Holdings in Apple, so it makes sense that they want to trim that off a little bit, especially considering Apple's major run up recently.
BULL6|And they've averaged a 20% annual return, which is very impressive.
NEUT7|The S&P 500 has been around 10% since its inception, and Berkshire Hathaway has been at 20%, which is.
NEUT8|If you actually run the numbers, that's more than double because of the compounding rate is approximately 4 to five times more.
NEUT9|It's actually a lot more than that.
NEUT10|It is an absurd amount more when you run the numbers to get 20% average annual return, they added shares of Verizon, AbbVie and others and then income investing will be difficult.
BULL11|He warned.
NEUT12|Also, there was only one mention of the pandemic, which is kind of shocking and overall he's thinking that America will stay strong.
NEUT13|And they keep investing, but he is worried about the way the economy is structured right now.
NEUT14|Given the GDP and his indicators.
BULL15|But overall looking forward great long term growth.
BULL16|Thanks for watching.
BULL17|"Hopefully that was insightful."""
