NEUT0|"""We want to be top of mind when someone thinks about how should I invest my money."
NEUT1|What service should I use?
NEUT2|Where is a good place to start?
NEUT3|So we want our service to be synonymous with the active investing.
NEUT4|My name is Vlad Tenev.
NEUT5|I'm the co-founder of Robin Hood and I'm 28 years old.
NEUT6|Before we started Robin Hood, we were in New York doing enterprise software for hedge funds in large institutions.
NEUT7|We were building technology that made it easier for banks and hedge funds to process trades completely automatically without any manual intervention, and this allowed them to place trades with no cost, basically placing a trade is as simple and as electronic as sending an email.
NEUT8|So after we saw that, we wondered.
NEUT9|Why is this technology?
NEUT10|Why are these tools not available to consumers?
NEUT11|Why are consumers still being charged 7 to $10?
NEUT12|A trade for a purely electronic transaction, and this was around the end of 2011 when the whole Occupy Wall Street movement was gaining a lot of traction and we saw that people our age had a lot of distrust for the establishment, distrust for Wall Street.
NEUT13|And here we were.
NEUT14|We had all this knowledge and we understood that the markets were such a powerful tool.
NEUT15|We wanted to make a company that actually stood for the consumer.
NEUT16|And brought Wall Street and made it actually useful.
NEUT17|An working in the best interests of normal everyday people.
BEAR18|The biggest mistake is leaving a lot of your money in your savings account.
NEUT19|One thing that might not be obvious is in the current interest rate environment.
NEUT20|With inflation, your money in a savings account is basically doing nothing.
BEAR21|You're essentially losing a few percent per year just due to inflation and the stock market over the past 100 years has returned an average of 10% per year.
NEUT22|So if you have a super long term outlook.
BULL23|"We believe that the stock market is actually a really, really good place for savings income."""
