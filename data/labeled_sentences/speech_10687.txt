BEAR0|"""I'm constantly trying to figure out why people keep by."
NEUT1|Can never find the answer.
NEUT2|And then I had an epiphany, a real Eureka moment last night.
NEUT3|I was calling over the positions that my child will trust in preparation for my monthly actionalertsplus.com members only Club talk, this time looking at them through the lens of the election.
NEUT4|Why not?
NEUT5|It's only 20 days away.
NEUT6|And you know what?
NEUT7|Of the 32 stocks we own for the charitable trust.
BULL8|Fully 2/3 of them would do better.
BULL9|Under a Biden presidency, Trump stock.
NEUT10|That caught me by surprise.
NEUT11|Of course we were trying to bet on the election.
NEUT12|We put this portfolio together over multiple years.
NEUT13|Honestly, I've been operating under the assumption that the market might take a hit if Biden wins, because why he wants to raise the corporate tax he wants to raise.
NEUT14|The capital gains tax wants to raise the tax on rich people.
NEUT15|They own stocks.
NEUT16|Even if you think that's good policy, it seems like I don't know how to obvious negative for the market.
BEAR17|Given that Biden's been getting some incredible poll numbers for the last few weeks, a Democratic sweep, it has become a real possibility, and I know many of you assume that's bad for stocks.
NEUT18|That is certainly what I thought, or at least that's what I thought before my big clubcall revelation.
NEUT19|So why is it that 2/3 of the stocks of my Chapel trust would benefit from a Biden victory?
NEUT20|The main reason is simple.
NEUT21|China.
NEUT22|China.
NEUT23|Let me take them down.
NEUT24|Starting with Apple, we know President Trump found suppon companies that do their manufacturing.
BEAR25|The People's Republic companies like Apple which also says of course a ton of merchandise over there makes a ton of jobs created, millions of jobs here.
BULL26|Now, I've been exceptionally supportive of the president's trade war.
BEAR27|I think we needed to crack down the Chinese Communist Party's bad behavior.
BEAR28|But that made life difficult for companies like Apple, Tim Cook, the terrific CEO.
BULL29|He's walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing, and he's done an incredible job.
BULL30|He would make the lenders proud.
NEUT31|But you know what?
BULL32|With Biden in the White House, he can get off the darn tightrope.
NEUT33|When you listen to Biden, he sounds tougher on China than President Obama was, but that's not so much for good or ill. A Democratic sweep in November means a less hostile relationship with the PRC.
BULL34|That would be very good news for Apple, which is why I think the stock could and maybe even has been rising substantially.
NEUT35|One perspective, Biden victory, an Apple by itself accounts for a sizeable chunk of the S&P 500.
