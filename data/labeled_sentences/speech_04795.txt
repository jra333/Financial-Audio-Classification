BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to the notes."
NEUT1|It's tempting to suggest that we can ignore the year so far, as virtually all the most dramatic trends that we saw in the first six weeks or so of the year have now completed.
NEUT2|Reversing even the S&P 500 itself was briefly up for the year at one point today, it's tempting, but on balance, I still think we should resist that temptation if we start by taking a look at the dollar.
NEUT3|This is the trade weighted index against a basket of other significant currencies.
BEAR4|A very sharp move down in the last two days following the very dovish statement we got from the Federal Reserve.
BULL5|Put in perspective you can see we are still very much stronger for the dollar than we were two years ago.
NEUT6|It's still not necessarily clear that the trend has been emphatic.
BULL7|Lee reversed, but distinct clear relief of the pressure.
BEAR8|A weak dollar makes life a lot easier for a lot of people.
NEUT9|Particularly emerging markets reduces some of what's known as the tail risk.
NEUT10|The risk of a significant.
NEUT11|Crisis now if we take a look at WTI crude you can see again if we look at it in long term perspective, perhaps you shouldn't get too carried away by what's happened so far this year.
BULL12|But we are up for the year.
BULL13|We're back above $40 per barrel.
BEAR14|There is still a long way to go before this very dramatic downward trend can be emphatic.
BULL15|Lee reversed, but plainly there are reasons why we have seen the recovery of the last few weeks.
NEUT16|Now if I've shown you surprise data for.
NEUT17|How U.S. economic data have come in that would have shown you a V shape, so would volatility.
NEUT18|So would inflation break evens?
BEAR19|There's a persistent pattern that we've seen a V shape as people suffered a very significant recession or deflationary scare in Aster about the second week of February and then steadily recovered from it.
NEUT20|Does that mean that all is well know there are still some significant signs that all is not totally as it should be?
NEUT21|Let's take a look at the S&P 500 and compare it to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.
NEUT22|This is an index of companies which are particularly reliable at paying out their dividends.
NEUT23|Generally something that begins to appeal to you when you're nervous.
NEUT24|When you want to be sure that you actually get your money, it's a show me the money index.
BEAR25|And as you can see, it has a radically outperformed over the last few months when people are that concerned to see money up front.
BEAR26|It's generally a sign that they still lack confidence.
BEAR27|Bear in mind still obviously, that the SNP remains well below its peak from last May.
NEUT28|And I don't think we can discount all that has happened over the last 12 weeks.
BEAR29|Plainly, there was a very significant scare.
NEUT30|That scare has been reversed.
BEAR31|"We are still unfortunately left with rather a worrying situation where there is still a lack of confidence."""
