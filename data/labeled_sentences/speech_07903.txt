BEAR0|"""What just happened on Monday?"
BEAR1|We have seen the biggest sell off for U.S. stocks since 2011, amid the heaviest trading volume in the second heaviest trading volume we've seen this decade volatility as measured by the VIX index, is suddenly spiked.
BULL2|It's higher even than it was immediately after the Brexit referendum or during the Greek exit crisis.
NEUT3|Now, why is this?
NEUT4|If we take a look at what happens to the 10 year Treasury yields and the stock market so far?
BULL5|This year you can see that we saw a very sharp rise in stocks to begin the year, even as yields steadily rose as interest rates began to rather menacingly as honest people saw that there might be a risk of inflation.
BULL6|Last week, yields finally got to a point where people began to reconsider their stock positions.
BEAR7|And today we've seen a very startling follow through assets stocks of sold off so aggressively that they've lost all their gains for this year and Meanwhile.
BEAR8|Bond yields have the money has flown back into bonds.
BEAR9|Bond yields have fallen very sharply now to be very clear, if we take a look at inflation break evens.
NEUT10|This is a measure of expected inflation from the bond market.
BULL11|It's not that worries about inflation have increased.
BEAR12|Today, the reverse inflation forecasts have actually fallen back.
NEUT13|This is about the knock on effects from last week's trading and who is going to be hurt by it.
BEAR14|In particular, people are worried.
NEUT15|By those who have deliberately better against fix, better that it was going to fall, which will last year was just about the best trade there was.
NEUT16|If we take a look at Pro shares Exchange traded.
NEUT17|Note that goes short the VIX.
BEAR18|You can see it's had a disastrous time so far, and it's fallen much further in after hours trading their concerns that this is going to create wiser losses that there were bets against this ETN.
NEUT19|Another other short VIX products like it.
BEAR20|There are also concerns that the banks that are involved with the underwriting them will also come under pressure as the week moves on.
NEUT21|That is where the immediate focus lies.
NEUT22|The longer focus once we've got through that is on the central banks and particularly the Fed.
NEUT23|This is what's happened to the odds of three rate rises this year.
NEUT24|You can see that at one point it was two in three roughly at the after the feds meeting last week.
BEAR25|Since then it's gone back.
NEUT26|To a 5050 shot.
BULL27|Despite the increase in concerns about inflation, the reason for that is twofold.
NEUT28|Firstly, if you do have stocks selling off like this, many are going to bet that the Fed will blink.
BEAR29|They won't want to do something that could push stocks down, even if they're worried about inflation.
NEUT30|Secondly, we have a new Fed Chairman in town this is Jay Pal's first official day in office markets.
NEUT31|Wants to test him.
NEUT32|That means that the.
NEUT33|First meeting, which he chairs of the FOMC in March, looms as a very important date when people can begin to assess whether central banks behavior really has changed after almost a decade of great leniency.
NEUT34|That is where we lie now.
BEAR35|"People have started to worry about inflation that has caused serious problems for those who had been betting otherwise, we need to get through those difficulties and then we need to find out what central banks are going to react to it."""
