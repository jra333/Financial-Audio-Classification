NEUT0|"""Of course we want to take a look at the market action that we're seeing today."
NEUT1|It is after hours of course, but what are we expecting for the trading day as we anticipate another day on Wall Street?
BULL2|Dow, S&P, NASDAQ futures all kind of surging higher throughout the course of this evening.
NEUT3|Brian Chung gonna get straight to you.
NEUT4|Are you surprised by this movement we're seeing right now?
NEUT5|Many of the strategists and economists we talked to at Yahoo Finance sort of baked in a potential contested election, right?
NEUT6|What do you think is causing this?
BULL7|Exuberance as we as we look to the markets here.
NEUT8|What melody, everyone?
BEAR9|Who's been watching this election is already feeling a lot of anxiety and watching the market does not provided any more relief.
BEAR10|In fact, it could be even more nauseating to have watched the market action over the previous hours.
NEUT11|As you mentioned, we're in after hours trading, not necessarily as liquid markets as we usually see during the market day.
BULL12|SMP Fight futures appear to be up pretty substantially about 1.15%.
BULL13|Dow futures up just a little bit about 122.
NEUT14|As of right now.
NEUT15|But what's been interesting is that it's really been teetering across the day.
BEAR16|Actually, between the periods of 7:45 and 9:50 PM Eastern Time, they were in the negative and then rocketed higher.
BULL17|In fact, the gains on the Dow were substantially higher, about an hour ago.
BEAR18|They've since come down a little bit, although they are still holding on to their gains.
NEUT19|But what's been even more interesting has really been movement in the currencies markets as well.
BEAR20|When you take a look at the US dollar, strengthening broadly across a basket of other currencies, you can check out how the euro, in addition to the British pound, have gotten weaker against the US dollar.
NEUT21|But when you look at specifically.
NEUT22|The Chinese yuan to USD to CN age that is offshore UN.
BEAR23|The UN has really gotten quite weak against the US dollar.
NEUT24|You could argue to what degree is that pricing and maybe the optimism over a Trump win there.
BEAR25|That could explain some of the yuan weakness.
BULL26|You also see some of the dollar strengthening and other types of currencies, specifically the Mexican peso.
NEUT27|Another one worth watching there and then moving over to bond yields.
NEUT28|A very interesting dynamic in play better as well.
NEUT29|When you look at the 10 year and the 30 year.
BEAR30|Losing a little bit of steam that does show that there could be some inflows into those bonds as people try to look for safe assets, but again, quite noisy, especially as the US stock markets continue to rock back and forth again.
BULL31|"Whether or not you can glean any anything from these futures and markets, whether or not their pricing in a trump or a Biden victory is a bit too noisy right now to discern, maybe we'll get a little bit more certainty, but there's no doubt melody of the volatility, at least for the past few hours, has been quite elevated."""
