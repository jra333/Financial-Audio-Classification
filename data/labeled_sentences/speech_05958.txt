BULL0|"""Short positions are building on streaming giant Netflix."
BULL1|It comes as Apple and Disney step up to the competition with plans to launch their own services next month.
BEAR2|Disney has the content ready and Apple has the network ready comes as analysts are growing increasingly concerned about the risk as well.
NEUT3|For Netflix.
BEAR4|With the average price target dropping to its lowest level in more than a year.
BEAR5|Just last week, Bloomberg reported that Rosenblatt Securities lowered its target on Netflix to $265 from 330.
NEUT6|The Daily Telegraph is reporting Meanwhile, that.
NEUT7|Reed Hastings and Netflix chief executive have previously played down competition, saying most of its subscribers come from broadcast television.
NEUT8|But speaking in Cambridge last month, he said new rivals could change that.
NEUT9|Let's take a look at where we are in terms of the share price on that were well above that Rosenblatt level.
NEUT10|It currently $280.93 or sessions on the IG platform.
NEUT11|I've got here at the bottom line here.
NEUT12|The volume it wants to highlight this area here.
BEAR13|These big red bars up here when we saw a little bit of a drop in the Netflix shares indicating that.

BULL15|But nonetheless I think there's an appetite here potentially to sell we're overbought in terms of the the stochastics you can see here, and the MACD is also an interesting interesting development as well.
NEUT16|We've got upper omentum in terms of the upside for Netflix stocks, so what's all this mean?
NEUT17|Well, clearly there are conflicting messages here.
NEUT18|Going on, I would suggest that the position to take.
BULL19|Is after the Bell on Wednesday when the company reports earnings and we'll find out for sure whether or not the company is able to produce good numbers, which will see an uplift in its shares.
NEUT20|If you go long on this, your target will be 29945 with a stop loss just below recent market action.
NEUT21|But if it's a dire set of figures you'd be looking at this area here at $254.00 as a line of support.
