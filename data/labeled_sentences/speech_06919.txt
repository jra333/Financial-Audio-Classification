NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, before moving onto the video we ask you to support us and subscribe to our channel please."
BULL1|The graph seems to have hit it stop after more than 600% gains accrued from the beginning of the year.
BULL2|A new all time was recently achieved at $2.90, leaving the $3 level tested but unbroken.
BEAR3|A retreat is underway from the highs, whereby the graph is trading at $2.28.
BEAR4|Since technical levels are turning bearish, the losses are likely to continue.
BEAR5|Following the rejection from the record, high GRT is holding at the descending channels middle boundary.
BEAR6|The bearish outlook may worsen if the press closes the day under this zone.
BULL7|Note that the moving average convergence divergent's is likely to add credibility to the pessimistic outlook.
BULL8|Currently, the MIC D indicator is in the positive region.
BEAR9|However, if the Mickey Blue line crosses below the signal line, the graph would break down towards the 50 simple moving average on the four hour chart around $1.30.
NEUT10|The channels, lower edges in line to offer support.
BEAR11|They could stop the bearish leg from extending further.
BEAR12|According to sentiment, the increase in selling pressure can be explained by the drop in the number of addresses holding large volumes of the graph.
NEUT13|For instance, the whales containing between 100,000 and 1,000,000 GRD topped out at 912 on January 22nd.
BEAR14|However, the decline has been consistent since then and the address is holding 395, representing a 65.9% drop.
BEAR15|This dip Archer by the whales could significantly influence the ongoing retreat.
NEUT16|The vivid bearish outlook will be invalidated if GRD holds the support of the descending parallel channel.
BULL17|A rebound from this support zone will place the graph on a trajectory towards new all time highs.
BULL18|Moreover, stepping above $3 will confirm to the investors that this token is yet to hit its global top.
