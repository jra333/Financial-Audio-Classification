BULL0|"""Everybody, thanks for watching this quick video on Churchill Capital Corporation."
BEAR1|So this this talk has been very volatile since the beginning of last week and the main reason is the good news that all the news that around this company that perhaps there there is no most likely they've closed the deal with the electric vehicle maker.
NEUT2|Lucid Motors.
NEUT3|Marriage with them just please confirm the news and keep reading and the news about this company.
NEUT4|About lucid Motors that they of course they make electric vehicles and if those news is going to be confirmed in the next days, just please based on technical analysis and fundamental analysis.
NEUT5|The idea is to go along with the first target price of 22 U.S. dollar and the next one will be 24 U.S. dollar.
NEUT6|Not this very easy technical analysis.
NEUT7|Interpretation is just mainly based on if you see exponential moving average of 50, but you can use as length 4050 or 40.
NEUT8|Let's use 40 is getting also close without any technical analysis.
NEUT9|Interpretation as we can see, one of the most trustworthy tools in technical analysis that this one worked as support for some of the bottom.
NEUT10|If you keep changing it or perhaps.
NEUT11|Reducing it to know, let's say 30 just the 30 VR is getting SQL error it is this is the perfect one.
NEUT12|It worked as support for this bottom support for this one and just was broken nearby.
NEUT13|Just in you know it's not very proper break out because it's less than 30 minutes so it was not even the closure price but was just one variation.
NEUT14|This kind of sick of 30 minutes.
NEUT15|So the idea is that this one.
NEUT16|Is a proper trendline, in fact, with my technical analysis, this red line is almost parallel to this exponential moving average.
NEUT17|So anyway, in conclusion, the idea is to go along as pair.
NEUT18|This quick technical analysis, and mainly for this news around this acquisition of this match with the electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors.
NEUT19|That's all from my side.
NEUT20|"Thanks, bye."""
