NEUT0|"""Joining us now with his outlook for the sector, Paul Sankey oil analyst at Mizuho, where do you rank coronavirus in terms of what it does to oil?"
NEUT1|What we obviously we don't really know, but potentially very seriously, because it's not so much the absolute impact of what happens.
NEUT2|That's what happens at the margin with oil and all.
NEUT3|The growth is essentially from China.
NEUT4|So as soon as you see a well China and India.
BEAR5|But as soon as you see something like this that affects China at the margin, it becomes extremely negative and very concerning.
BEAR6|And we're oversupplied in oil so it becomes a double whammy.
BEAR7|There's been a lot of volatility recently because of action in the Middle East and other things.
NEUT8|How do the how are the oil companies?
NEUT9|How are Chevron and Exxon positions to whether all of this volatility?
NEUT10|Well, what we're saying to them is you've got a plan on 40, and let's make everything else free cash flow, you know.
NEUT11|So get your CapEx down, get your spending down, get your costs down effectively, do a ConocoPhillips plan.
BEAR12|The company of 40 and all this noise, which is unavoidable, just becomes by the more free cash flow or less free cash flow.
NEUT13|But the companies in the amps are getting there, we call it the Renaissance thesis.
NEUT14|They have to be in the same position.
BULL15|They have to be able to coherently pay a dividend and maintain some sort of volume sustainability at 40.
NEUT16|And then you know who knows what's going to happen next, 'cause it could be.
NEUT17|We flew, but don't forget, we've also got Libya.
BEAR18|Libya is not getting any attention right now, but there's a million barrels a day off line in Libya.
BEAR19|Right now, we're down 7% in in the week, 11% so far this this year.
NEUT20|I mean, how much are we got ahead of the current situation?
NEUT21|We already pricing in a sort of sauce style epidemic.
BULL22|If things ease from here.
BULL23|So we have quite a swift rebound.
BEAR24|Well, not really, because essentially the market is oversupplied for the whole first half.
NEUT25|Now that's notwithstanding the Libya situation, which actually emerged almost exactly at the same time as we flew.
BEAR26|At the moment, essentially the DoD DoD data, which really is prior to any of this happening, is very weak.
BEAR27|We're seeing terrible US gasoline demand really bad.
BEAR28|This, like we're having a horrendous Lee warm winter from the point of view of energy demand.
NEUT29|So actually it's probably only just beginning to be priced in, and I think really up.
NEUT30|Until probably yesterday we weren't really sure that we flee wasn't just a storm in a teacup.
NEUT31|"It now seems that it is going to be a very big deal."""
