NEUT0|"""OK, so we'll have a prediction Kroger fire some Bible believers."
NEUT1|So I think they're going down.
NEUT2|They need to be bought.
NEUT3|Any anybody who save needs to boycott Kroger.
BEAR4|If if they go against the law that you can't discriminate over religious and then they fire 2 Bible believers.
NEUT5|Because they believe they stood for what they believed then.
NEUT6|Display just like Kmart.
NEUT7|It went down Kroger's going down I this is my prediction that Kurt Kroger is going down when they fire 2 Bible believers.
NEUT8|If you study what happened.
NEUT9|There's other people who didn't.
NEUT10|Go along with but they only fired the Bible believers.
NEUT11|Who didn't go along with their uniform policy?
BEAR12|So Kroger's going down.
BEAR13|It's already in the last five years is down.
BULL14|11% in the last year.
NEUT15|It's a.
NEUT16|31%.
NEUT17|They need to be boycott.
BEAR18|Boycotted need to boycott Kroger.
NEUT19|If you're saved, you need to boycott Kroger.
NEUT20|If you don't start standing up for the truth in your everyday purchases.
NEUT21|Kroger has proved that they fire that they hate Bible believers.
BEAR22|They fired 2 Bible believers but they didn't fire other employees.
BEAR23|For not go along with her quote unquote dress policy Kroger.
NEUT24|Is going against the creation.
NEUT25|Anytime you go against the creation.
NEUT26|The creators against you?
NEUT27|I'm telling you Kroger.
NEUT28|If if you really.
NEUT29|You need to be if you really a.
NEUT30|Probably you don't need to go there.
NEUT31|This is my this is this is this is the deal people you need to start standing for what's what's right.
NEUT32|And you can do it really simple.
NEUT33|You just don't go there and buy your groceries.
NEUT34|You go somewhere to go to food line, you go somewhere else.
NEUT35|You buy your groceries from somebody else.
NEUT36|And if and you know what they're going to change when it hits their pocketbook.
NEUT37|They're going to change when it hits their wallet because all they do is worship mammon money.
NEUT38|That's what they worship.
NEUT39|And so.
BEAR40|My prediction is this stocks going to go down.
NEUT41|And I'm just documenting.
NEUT42|I'm not telling people what to do, but I know one thing I don't have.
NEUT43|We don't have a Kroger here thankfully, but they used to have one, but it disappeared.
BEAR44|It's going down, I'm telling you.
BEAR45|This I bet you the stock goes down.
NEUT46|I'm just going to document it for I'ma look back in a year.
NEUT47|Prediction that the Kroger stock goes down?
NEUT48|Let's see, let's I'm now.
NEUT49|Actually I'm going to pray.
BEAR50|I'm going to pray that their stock goes down.
NEUT51|Because they're attacking.
BEAR52|"Bible believers in there actually going against the other states Constitution."""
