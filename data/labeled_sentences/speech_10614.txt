NEUT1|This seems unbelievably great CFO's out there.
NEUT2|One of the most terrific is rich Galanti at Costco, and he summed it up in one sense.
NEUT3|But what's going on right now at his stores, which is people have more money 'cause they're spending less on air travel and hotel and dining out?
NEUT4|And there it is.
NEUT5|There it is.
NEUT6|That is what's making it so people are spending on their home.
NEUT7|And I gotta point out that dining outs really, really expensive hotels are crazy.
NEUT8|But air travel is just something that eats you alive, and so all that money is being plowed in and that's why it says Costco has having these mid teens quarters.
BULL9|What a quarter, it had.
NEUT10|Fantastic David.

NEUT20|I said it.
NEUT21|OK, they go out and they pay 12 bucks for Margie and I love him.
NEUT22|That's how you can make money.
NEUT23|But instead now they're going to Costco and they're buying a saw.
