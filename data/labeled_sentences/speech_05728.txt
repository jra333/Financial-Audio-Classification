NEUT0|"""Turning back to the markets now, how did the stock market returns for companies in swing states impact the election?"
NEUT1|Right now we've got Jack Ablin.
NEUT2|He's a chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
NEUT3|He's with us.
NEUT4|Hey, Jack.
NEUT5|Thanks, hi, hi, let's talk about this.
NEUT6|You have thought a lot about this about the performance of companies that were in these swing States and how that might have impacted last night's election.
NEUT7|Give us your theories.
BULL8|Well, you know, not only did the blue states outperform the red states over the last four years under President Obama's first term, but the swing states all handily outperformed the S&P 500, with Nevada far outpacing the SNP running something like 68% per year over the last four years, compared to something like 11 1/2% for the SNP.
NEUT9|And how much do you think that actually impacted the results last night?
NEUT10|I mean, do you think voters are aware of that?
NEUT11|Is it something that sort of in the subconscious that they feel?
BULL12|Better in their states when they go to vote.
NEUT13|Or do you think it's just coincidence?
NEUT14|Well, I think some coincidence, but I also think there's a fair amount of confidence that the fact is, if you know you're in Nevada and you work for a casino and chances are you own some of the stock, either in your own account or in your retirement plan.
BULL15|So I think that certainly could provide you a little bit of a boost.
NEUT16|There are a lot of gold miners in in Nevada as well, so you know it's hard to point to any particular area, but I will say you know when you're when you're in these swing states an you know this election is hanging in the balance.
BULL17|Certainly having a higher degree of confidence helps the incumbents and Jack we look at some of the other swing states besides Nevada, looking at Ohio, Florida, Virginia.
NEUT18|What were some of the sectors that were put in particular doing well in those states prior to last night's election?
NEUT19|Sure, Florida, you know certainly was a rebound of housing and builders.
BULL20|I think that helped Virginia.
NEUT21|We had media companies.
BULL22|You know, gave them a little boost.
NEUT23|I don't recall all of the other other other sector groups, but I think that you know generally these are either businesses that are headquartered in those states or do quite a bit of business in those states alright.
NEUT24|Jack ablin.
BULL25|Thanks so much for being with us.
BULL26|"Appreciate your analysis this morning."""
