NEUT0|"""Two decades ago, Big Tobacco had its existential moment."
BULL1|Landmark 1998 settlement with 46 U.S. states open the door to more than $100 billion in liabilities.
BEAR2|Big bankruptcies seemed imminent.
BULL3|The industry faced a future of increasing regulation in declining sales.
BEAR4|Investors fled the sector.
BEAR5|Turns out though, things didn't end up nearly so bad for the tobacco industry.
BULL6|Revenues in the United States hit 117 billion in 2016, up from 78 billion in 2001.
NEUT7|The United States generates more tobacco profits than any other market in the world outside China.
NEUT8|Americans spent more than 90 billion at retail stores on cigarettes last year.
NEUT9|Compare that to about $50 billion on beer and 40 billion on soda.
BEAR10|But smoking rates are dropping in 1995, about 25% of Americans smoked 20 years later, in 2015, only 15% did taxes have significantly increased, and yet industry profits have gone up.
NEUT11|How can this be?
NEUT12|The answer lies in the strange economics of the industry and the profound disconnection between the price of cost to manufacture a pack of cigarettes and the price at which they were sold.
NEUT13|Last year.
NEUT14|The average price of a pack of Marlboros in the United States with $6.31.
NEUT15|Only 18% of that was actual manufacturing costs, while retail markup with 17% and the tax is 42%.
BEAR16|This leaves operating profits of around 20%.
BULL17|The differing tax burdens help account for the wide disparities in retail prices around the world.
NEUT18|In 2015, the average pack of cigarettes cost $1.40 in Indonesia, $6.29 in the United States, $10.62 in the United Kingdom in $17.00.
NEUT19|In Australia, the most expensive pack in the world, British American Tobacco says that it makes the same amount of revenue, selling just two packs of cigarettes in the United States as it does selling.
BULL20|13 and it's developing markets with every tax increase.
BULL21|Cigarette manufacturers continue to tack on higher margins for themselves.
BULL22|In 2001, the average pack in the United States cost only $3.73 by 2005 that climbed to $4.05 to $5.87 in 2010, and an estimated $6.42 last year.
NEUT23|What makes this all possible, of course, is that cigarettes are addictive.
NEUT24|"Prices are determined less by the traditional laws of supply and demand then on what consumers are able to spend and what consumers are willing to spend based on the intensity of their cravings."""
