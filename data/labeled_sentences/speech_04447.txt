NEUT0|"""Keep your eye on Apple today along with Amazon Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty."
BULL1|Jim says the 12 is tracking ahead looking for a record quarter in December.
BULL2|5% above consensus on earnings and bull case.
BULL3|200 other targets 152 that was such a good report.
NEUT4|Remember, she does always have the inside track I find, and one of the things I really liked about it is she's talking about you're getting kind of a lowball.
BULL5|She's saying solid, but not great December results.
NEUT6|That's what I want to see.
BULL7|I want to see everything tempered and that allows them to do well.
BULL8|They got a 5 to 7% ahead of the consensus.
NEUT9|Obviously you're talking about just a huge number of phones being sold.
NEUT10|Where ************ people are talking about the glasses too.
NEUT11|I think that that Stross, but when Katie Huberty goes in and gives her that price target and raise it, she takes her price target so seriously.
NEUT12|Rate we should all tell people at home most these people just like it's like throwing darts and price target.
BULL13|She's closed from 144 to 152 and I think that was just incredible.
BULL14|Tony secondary again dragged into say something positive he's gotta hold on.
NEUT15|He's over at Bernstein and David, I just want to put Tony Super nice.
BULL16|Unites them now super nice to you, super nice.
NEUT17|Yeah I didn't just nice and it'll be on Scott Wapner having one.
NEUT18|You'll see how nice he is.
NEUT19|He's also very smart and rigorous.
NEUT20|Come on.
NEUT21|He had known Tony forever.
NEUT22|Yeah of course very good and he does quality work but oftentimes may reach a different conclusion.
NEUT23|The finest work but a different conclusion.
NEUT24|I respect it.
NEUT25|I just want to work right.
NEUT26|I don't want his price target where you know I want his work.
NEUT27|Carl, that's what's important with Tony.
NEUT28|Saggy naggy's work.
NEUT29|Yeah yeah.
NEUT30|He his his.
BULL31|His view this morning is a little more tempered achates note though, Jim interesting, you know there's this growing sense that, well, consumers upgraded during the year last year.
NEUT32|They're not going to do it again, or survey indicates intentions on electronics and PCs.
NEUT33|Accessories of large are still at 91 pies at the end of the year, so that'll be interesting.
NEUT34|We're still working at home, and I think it's going to be a hybrid strategy.
NEUT35|Everybody's gonna die.
NEUT36|Many people got the hybrid strategy.
NEUT37|The wowway weaknesses important.
NEUT38|A shout out David Peter Navarro.
NEUT39|We worked at you, worked in the in the previous administration.
NEUT40|He was instrumental in crippling wildway David Peter Navarro.
NEUT41|You gotta say twice.
NEUT42|Well I got him on speed dial.
NEUT43|Yeah I think you could delete that really would take that out of the speed that I would I would.
NEUT44|That would be my advice but it's under Pete we've done it awhile ago.
NEUT45|Well, I mean, I don't know.
NEUT46|I don't have you on speed.
NEUT47|I got him.
NEUT48|OK, that's a little surprising to me as well.
NEUT49|You've managed to find out she never spoken to Peter Navarro.
NEUT50|I don't believe that either.
NEUT51|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT52|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
