NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see today Apple formed a doji pattern here with a red candle."
NEUT1|So this condo has a.
NEUT2|Larger upper tail, so it means.
BEAR3|Resistance upset and if we check the volume we can see here the volume is not small so it's a comparatively large than yesterday.
NEUT4|So as we said yesterday that it's still likely for Apple to form I.
NEUT5|Second top here.
BULL6|Compared to this one.
NEUT7|So in my opinion, this volume shows that there's still a long way for Apple to go study so we can see here.
NEUT8|It's just between the two year mates, so it's not.
NEUT9|Study side so it still need to retest the low.
NEUT10|From here is 103, so it's very likely for Apple to retest the law in the next several days, so if it does so.
BULL11|It means the whole US share market will test the.
NEUT12|Lost.
NEUT13|The latest known the law.
NEUT14|So in my opinion, hold your money.
NEUT15|Don't go back to early.
BULL16|"Thank you."""
