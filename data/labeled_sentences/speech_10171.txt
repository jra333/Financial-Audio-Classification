NEUT0|"""What's up stocks going today?"
NEUT1|We're talking about junior.
NEUT2|Show me a strange day around this $37.
NEUT3|Up and down.
BULL4|It's swinging and I've been building my position on this one and I think I'm going to get more of these stocks because right now it's trading at 37.
BEAR5|But if you look at the week it dropped to 33 and then it's recovering has been recovering recovering.
BEAR6|If you look at the month it was way down from 47.
NEUT7|So I think right now is a good entry point.
BULL8|If it drops a little bit more, it will be even better.
NEUT9|But I'm going to have at least 150 shares in this one.
NEUT10|Because I believe he's going to go to 50 soon.
BULL11|"Anne, thanks guys for watching."""
