BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to learn it all."
NEUT1|In this video I will share my trade ideas for Zoom Info tech ticker symbol ZI.
NEUT2|I'm invested long time in Zoom in for tech.
NEUT3|However I do see this short term opportunity as well, based on technicals which I will be sharing in this video.
NEUT4|So let's get started.
BULL5|Zi has seen this reversal since it bottom at 3083 and has been holding this green uptrending channel.
BULL6|In the last two trading days, especially on Friday, we saw some nice volume coming in.
NEUT7|And a holding.
NEUT8|The support trend.
NEUT9|When we go to the one hour chart.
NEUT10|You will notice this nice double bottom.
NEUT11|Which is a confirmation of the support.
NEUT12|Let's go back to the one day chart.
NEUT13|And if we look at the RSI.
NEUT14|Which is currently holding at 50.
BULL15|Looks healthy and seems to be bouncing off the lows.
NEUT16|Similarly, the Mac D seems to be reversing at this stage.
NEUT17|Now let's talk about the swing trade.
BEAR18|I have placed for a 15% gain or a 2.5% loss.
NEUT19|I placed the market order of 500 shares for December 21st when market opens.
NEUT20|And will take my profits around 5152.
NEUT21|I've set my stop loss below the Green Support channel.
BEAR22|So in this trade I could make up to $4000 if everything goes as per the plan or lose $800 if the market goes against me, which could very well happen as well.
NEUT23|Let me know your thoughts on this trade idea and I will see you in my next video.
