BEAR0|"""Got stopped out."
NEUT1|Risk management a lot of times when I sell something like that, it is predicated on risk management.
NEUT2|I still fundamentally believe in the story.
NEUT3|I think Brad is right about what he sees for the vision of this company.
NEUT4|As an online merchant in China, but unfortunately this is stocked.
NEUT5|It was 210 just five weeks ago, then last Wednesday you had a print of 165 were trading below 140.
NEUT6|Today proper risk management.
NEUT7|Sometimes you have to cut your losses.
NEUT8|That's what happened.
NEUT9|Let this go through another one just in case you you freeze up again.
NEUT10|Sure you, Oh yeah, you own Pinterest.
NEUT11|OK, the stock got downgraded today and for those who own it, yeah, what do you tell him?
BEAR12|Downgraded to neutral Bank of America.
BEAR13|The price target gets cut to 78 from 94.
NEUT14|So in general I don't like these technology names that have these high valuations towards triple digits and the Pinterest is a little bit lower somewhere in the mid 80s, but I like the picture story.
NEUT15|I like the social media platform that it is.
NEUT16|I was talking with Patty, our producer about how this is kind of like linked in a couple of years ago and I think someone, whether it's a Microsoft or someone else in Mega Cap technology, they're going to look at this and realize that the prevalence of good that comes from this platform.
NEUT17|This is not.
NEUT18|The cesspool of Twitter or other platforms.
NEUT19|This is a platform where advertisers want to be there.
NEUT20|They could connect with the end user.
BULL21|The growth of e-commerce Israel 400 monthly active users for this company, an astronomical international growth of close to 50%.
NEUT22|It's a name I'm going to hold that disagree with the call.
BEAR23|I heard Jim Cramer this morning saying he didn't like Pinterest here.
BEAR24|I'm sorry Jim.
NEUT25|I think Pinterest is the name you want to hold.
NEUT26|It's the next linktone.
NEUT27|Wow, OK?
NEUT28|Maybe Cramer away in on Twitter what he thinks about you saying that alright, the Bank of America also downgrade.
NEUT29|I'm trying to I always try to stir it up.
BEAR30|Snap got downgraded at Bank of America.
NEUT31|John you won't snap calls.
NEUT32|Yeah, I I think this one is one that you want to buy on dips for sure, Scott Millennials.
NEUT33|They use this.
NEUT34|Still millennials are not on Facebook.
NEUT35|They might be using WhatsApp and Instagram, but they're not on Facebook.
NEUT36|Scott, they're on Snapchat, which is of course the company under SNAP.
NEUT37|And that's why I think you want to own this one to reach that audience, you have to be on that.
NEUT38|So I'm comfortable holding this one.
NEUT39|"I've written upside calls against the calls that I already own, and I don't think you get much of a dip, but if it does give you a nice opportunity, I think people should buy it."""
