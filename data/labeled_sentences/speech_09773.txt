NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|While a very rough day on this one, not because it was red per southeast, but because from the technical point of view, it broke down below a very important whoops level of support, which is right there at $18.50 and that brings about the first key update here, which is just based on a foundation of rule in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance so now moving forward 1850 is going to be that near term area of resistance where if the price does try to consolidate out and then it works way back upwards.
NEUT5|That's where all eyes are going to be.
NEUT6|Kind of watching and wondering can the price?
NEUT7|Get up through and stay up above that 1850 Mark, so watch that very closely in the event the price can push up to that level.
NEUT8|Next, key level you would want to watch would then be that purple line up there, the 50.
NEUT9|Moving average.
NEUT10|Which is currently valued right around the $20 mark.
NEUT11|But let's not get too far, however ourselves.
NEUT12|Let's just first see if the price can even bounce up to you, know 1850 and then break above it before you know, put too much focus on these other areas of resistance, but nonetheless, there's going to be two of the main technical levels to watch from the resistant side of things as far as supports are concerned, not to squeeze down the chart here quite a bit 'cause its been along time since the price have been down at this location.
NEUT13|So next key level of support to watch going to be right there at the $17.00 mark and then of $17.00 cannot quite hold up.
NEUT14|Next, key level.
NEUT15|After that down there around 1635 so 17 and then 1635.
NEUT16|Next couple areas of support.
BEAR17|Yeah, as of right now the downtrend continues and today I mean it looks like the selling pressure increase that much more.
NEUT18|So we'll see what happens with it.
NEUT19|But yeah, the week is young.
NEUT20|Still four days left so we'll see what the next several days have to offer.
NEUT21|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT22|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT23|But it will be me.
NEUT24|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL25|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT26|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT27|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR28|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT29|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT30|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT31|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT32|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT33|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT34|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT35|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT36|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
