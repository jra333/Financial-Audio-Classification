NEUT0|"""Thing about Disney that I just maybe I've already said this, but I want to say it again."
NEUT1|There's four businesses here that are all kicking it.
NEUT2|Studio was a 52%.
BULL3|Operating income is up, 72 is 72% overall.
NEUT4|And that's a business.
NEUT5|That's a six and a half billion dollar business parks and resorts six and a half billion dollar business.
NEUT6|Sorry, the media business six and a half $1,000,000 business studio is about 3 1/2 and then if you look at the DTC, another three nephew, four large businesses that are all doing very well separately.
NEUT7|And that's why I just think that this isn't just a media company.
NEUT8|This is kind of a must own to Tim's point.
NEUT9|What we do know about the businesses that are not in as big flux, right?
BULL10|Everything's going really well though.
NEUT11|You know studios are very lumpy.
NEUT12|They shouldn't get a huge multiple to me, though, it all comes back to Netflix.
NEUT13|How can Netflix be valued here when Disney not there right now?
BEAR14|I just don't get it.
NEUT15|Well.
NEUT16|Here's one though that I go back to the parent of CNBC.
BULL17|Comcast is a cheap stock trading 13 times next year's expected earnings growth through about 11 percent 5% sales growth.
NEUT18|I mean, to me, you think a lot of the dynamics that Disney.
NEUT19|Is kind of keying on right now.
NEUT20|This is stuff that Comcast has had in the works for a long time.
NEUT21|I mean, I think a lot of these stocks can work X Netflix.
BEAR22|I think that we've seen North American Subs decline.
NEUT23|What two quarters in a row?
BEAR24|Now they're at a price point.
BULL25|They just raised their prices earlier in this year and Disney.
NEUT26|Plus, we know 6 bucks or something like that.
NEUT27|And they're taking off all their content and they're going to make it right there.
NEUT28|I just think that one of the things that Disney will start to trade off of when this service launches next week.
NEUT29|They're going to introduce this Mandalorian.
NEUT30|It's a Star Wars show.
NEUT31|Jon Favreau, the director.
NEUT32|Now wait, I cannot wait for everybody but but think about it, this is a $6 a month service.
NEUT33|You get all your Marvel, you get all your Lucas.
NEUT34|You get all your pics are you get all your Disney sort of stuff and they're going to be branching out, doing a lot of the stuff that's just exclusive to their service.
NEUT35|Half the valuation though.
NEUT36|I mean, is it worth making that bet?
NEUT37|I mean, it's half the valuation of Disney affectively, right here.
BEAR38|Half the valuation of Comcast, by the way is CBS, which has been floundering recently.
NEUT39|Bouncing off the bottom.
NEUT40|So at a certain point you play the valuation game so I don't even know if in terms of Comcast, you need to know the answer.
NEUT41|You just have to make the bet that listen, we can all agree that Disney deserves the multiple they get.
NEUT42|But should Comcast traded half that multiple?
NEUT43|Shouldn't they get a little bump in this environment?
NEUT44|And then shouldn't CBS an?
NEUT45|I can't wait for this mandolin rain.
NEUT46|It's going to be unbelievable when it comes out.
NEUT47|I will be Dan can watch it together.
NEUT48|I can only hope can you?
NEUT49|Can we do that?
NEUT50|We will do.
NEUT51|"It would be fun."""
