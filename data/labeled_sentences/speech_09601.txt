BULL0|"""Just at an initial glance of this first S one when compared with many IPO filings that we look at what DoorDash has done here financially is truly nothing short of impressive huge revenue growth at scale."
BULL1|The company more than tripling its top line in the 1st 3/4 of the year, it's narrowing net losses showing a pocket of profitability even in the second quarter, DoorDash posting nearly $200 million in free cash flow and has quickly scaled to become number one in market share in the US.
NEUT2|Food delivery space.
NEUT3|That's all remarkable.
NEUT4|But remember, investors want to know the trajectory for the future.
NEUT5|They're going to be asking how much of this can be attributed to the pandemic, and assuming one day the world goes back to some semblance of normal, do these trends revert back to the mean?
NEUT6|DoorDash acknowledges that might happen in its S1.
NEUT7|The company saying in a state as part of the S1, the circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future.
BEAR8|And we expect the growth rates in revenue total orders an marketplace giovi, which stands for gross order value to decline in future periods.
NEUT9|Now any type of guidance will be critical here for investors as this company begins its marketing an its roadshow process, which could begin as soon as two weeks from now guys.
NEUT10|Right and Leslie, you know.
NEUT11|I've heard I've heard a few folks this morning called DoorDash, you know, a clear covid play, but I think that might be a little bit overly simplistic, because, yes, it's in the food delivery space, which has seen huge demand amid the pandemic.
NEUT12|However, as you mentioned, if these trends are here to stay, who's going to benefit?
NEUT13|And who's going to have a tougher time?
NEUT14|So one of the first things I did when I went through the S one was look at what the share prices of Uber and Grubhub we're doing.
NEUT15|Uber, of course, has made this big pivot to food delivery, which now makes up more of its gross bookings and even.
NEUT16|Ride sharing and Uber shares.
BEAR17|They actually declined while Grubhub shares went the other way.
NEUT18|They jumped on this S1 and that comes down to this measure of profitability.
NEUT19|Remember Leslie last year when we watch Uber and Lyft go public and all we could talk about was profitable growth and how this era of growth at all costs was ending?
BULL20|And what door Dash has given us is this incredible growth with certainly more of a path to profitability than I have seen from Uber.
NEUT21|So this could be a pandemic play, but a food delivery is here to stay.
BULL22|And door Dash has 50% of the market right now, it seems like a pretty good bet and think a lot of folks in San Francisco that I've been talking about talking to were expecting to see these good financials.
NEUT23|But now we sort of have the proof in the pudding.
NEUT24|As you say, though, is a sustainable, and that's certainly going to be around the edges of really, really important question.
NEUT25|Yeah, and I think the question is what do you do with your time now?
BULL26|You're showing positive free cash flow, you're narrowing your losses.
BULL27|Torda path of profitability here.
NEUT28|So what do you do with that?
NEUT29|You invest in a in the model that allows you to be, you know, profitable when the pandemic, if and hope the pandemic ends.
NEUT30|Do you invest in your companies so that you do?
NEUT31|Have you know you continue to gain share in this space?
NEUT32|You maybe by a competitor.
NEUT33|Do you do something along those lines that enable you to?
BULL34|Maybe not see the same type of growth that you're experiencing right now, but you were at least able to be more competitive in the future.
NEUT35|Anan show investors that you have a plan and a path to do that.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
