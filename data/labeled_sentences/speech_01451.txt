BULL0|"""Cantor chain grow very significantly, and this altcoin cycle."
NEUT1|In this video we're going over the chart.
NEUT2|We're setting a price target and we're also going over the fundamentals so Tor Chain is a decentralized liquidity protocol and it is 100% autonomous.
NEUT3|You can deposit native assets into liquidity pools to earn yield.
NEUT4|Heading to the chart, we see that oil change prices currently at 3.78 U.S. dollars.
BULL5|It's broken through the resistance level at the 2.6 U.S. dollar level about two days ago, and since then has had a 42% pump.
NEUT6|We're going to be setting a price target a bit later on guys, but first let's head to the fundamentals.
NEUT7|Torture has a market cap of 745 million, a 24 hour trading volume of 114 million, circulating supply of 232,000,000 and the maximum supply of 500,000,000.
NEUT8|So rude that or chain token has five main uses.
NEUT9|It can be used for liquidity as a settlement, acid security as a simple resistant mechanism.
NEUT10|Governance to signal priority on tour chain.
NEUT11|It can be used as an incentive mechanism to payout rewards, charge fees and subsidized gas and it can also be used as an amplifier to elevate assets.
NEUT12|So since storage it has their own token as a settlement asset, torching will require much less pools than a competitor.
NEUT13|For example, if a competitor has 1000 tokens on its network but no native token, then that competitor would need almost 500,000 liquidity pools, and so each one of those liquidity pools would become very shallow and the liquid so torching has a simple resistant mechanism and nodes on tour.
NEUT14|She need to commit a minimum of 1,000,000 rule in order to be turned into the network, so room can also be used for governance and every three days.
NEUT15|And yes, it is listed as a pool onto a chain and in a queue of standby acids that want to be listed.
NEUT16|The one with the deepest commitment of rule is the one that is most likely to be listed.
NEUT17|So over here we see how the price of assets will be decided by the exchange, which is most liquid and torching aims to pull in liquid ITI from every corner of the cryptosphere, creating incredibly the polls.
NEUT18|When this happens, the value of room token will rise.
BULL19|Over here we see how pulling assets on torturing can lead to an annualized yield of up to 340%.
NEUT20|OK, we're going to get to our price target soon, but first let's head to the rest of the market.
BULL21|One of us had another significant bump as predicted in our previous video and is currently sitting at 3.8 U.S. dollars.
BULL22|Looping is currently at 0.48 U.S. dollars and it seems that it will be retesting the 0.5 level today.
BULL23|Uni swap seems to be stabilizing at the 15.6 U.S. dollar level.
BULL24|And I'm expecting it to continue pumping forward.
NEUT25|Avalanche is at 11.7 U.S. dollars.
BULL26|It seems to be consolidating at this level and I'm expecting a further bump in the next few days.
BULL27|In fact, I think this is a good buying opportunity for Avalanche.
BULL28|The top three gainers over the past 24 hours are for each other token up 49.9% Alpha finance at 46.3%, and one inch up 27.8%.
BULL29|Getting back to their own chart, I believe that the total market cap of 20 billion is achievable for torturing during the peak of the outgoing cycle and that would give a 20X and value for their own token, meaning that it would achieve a price of eight U.S. dollars over here and ask.com we see how Elon Musk added Bitcoin to his Twitter bio and a few hours after the price of Bitcoin rose by 15%.
BULL30|This is a very interesting time for the crypto markets and having the backing of big names like Elon Musk is amazing for us.
BULL31|OK guys, I hope you learn something new from this video.
