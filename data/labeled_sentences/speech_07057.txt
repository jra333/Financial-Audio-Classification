NEUT0|"""What Julie Boston was just talking about Facebook reaching out to the big financials?"
NEUT1|I guess.
NEUT2|Obviously looking for client information or client data hoping to mine that database to come up with new services market seems to like it does do you?
NEUT3|Well, we think that there's a mixed story there.
BULL4|We know that there's a potential for good rebound in Facebook stock because they've just been hit quite hard and this could be the catalyst for such a rebound.
NEUT5|So I guess we'll have to see how that plays out.
NEUT6|How likely is it?
NEUT7|Save that we're going to see some kind of a rebound or the cap.
BULL8|This is the catalyst for a rebound, I should say.
NEUT9|Well, I think that this could serve as such a catalyst because with the Facebook they've got such a broad base.
BULL10|And yes, they've had suffered hits, but they've suffered just before and every single time they have rebounded.
BEAR11|Also, the General US technology sector defies a lot of expectations that continues to make new highs.
NEUT12|And we do think there are some underlying reasons why the whole tech sector could rise and Facebook could be part of that as well.
NEUT13|Steve, if if if we can, I want to sort of pull it broader and take a look back and do sort of a comparo how U.S. markets have been doing versus let's say a lot of the other key markets in the rest of the world and we've got an interesting graphic.
NEUT14|I want to throw up and let viewers have a look at.
NEUT15|There's how Wall Street finished up overnight, but the other graphic I was talking about was the US versus other key markets globally.
NEUT16|And when that comes up, Steve, you're going to be able to see that you know.
NEUT17|Despite all this trade stuff that's been going on since March.
NEUT18|You know, Wall Street just continues marching higher.
BEAR19|There you go of 6%, Tokyo is down, 6 Germany is down 7.
BEAR20|Chinese markets are down 10%.
NEUT21|You know you can make a lot of arguments about earnings growing it in excess of 20%, etc.
NEUT22|But can you make an argument for value in these other markets which have taken a leg down?
NEUT23|Well, I think that there is a short term and a longer term dynamic at play in the short term, we've got highly divergent set of policies in the US versus the rest of the world that are helping the US outperform.
NEUT24|Right now.
BULL25|We've got fiscal policy that's very strong, very stimulated in the US with that tax cuts with that deregulation, and this has quite immediate impact on the markets.
NEUT26|Same time we've got a divergent monetary policy.
NEUT27|We've got Federal Reserve Board that's been hiking rates now seven times looking to hike rates at least another five times of the next several months.
NEUT28|And yet, monetary policy always operates with a lag.
BEAR29|Yield curves not inverted yet in the US, that means that U.S. stocks still have a green light to go higher, but this this this monetary tightening in the US has caused the dollar to strengthen and that is the enemy of some of the foreign markets.
NEUT30|Some of the international global markets you mentioned, like China like, emerging markets.
BEAR31|These currencies have been hit hard.
NEUT32|Emerging markets tend to hate a strong dollar because they borrow a lot of dollar based debt and.
NEUT33|And so that explains a lot of divergent.
