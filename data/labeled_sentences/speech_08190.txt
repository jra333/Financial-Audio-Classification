NEUT12|So Netflix is scheduled to report its earnings after Tuesday closes stock at a record high of $575 shares in 2020 and is currently trading at $500 a share.
BEAR13|So the stock is prone for big moves after opponents earning and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong.
BULL14|Controversially, if the numbers disappointed stocking easily gap down, which is good for us because you can get in for cheap and then it's gonna go back up.
NEUT15|To help you prepare, here's what Wall Street is expecting, so so earnings are expected to be earnings of dollars.
NEUT16|Thirty eight cents a share on 6060 billion dollar revenue.

NEUT18|That's profit on each share.
NEUT19|The whisper number in Wall Street's unofficial view of earnings so closely look at the fundamentals of the format.
BULL20|Fundamentally, the company has enjoyed double and triple digit earnings and sales and growth over the past four quarters.
BEAR21|Needless to say, while subscriptions went up because you know, you know what's going on, the rate of growth is decelerating, which may be a concern going forward.
NEUT22|I guess more people come back outside.
NEUT23|But it's Netflix.
NEUT24|I don't think it's going anywhere.
BULL25|The company has benefited from the state home world and we find ourselves in do of Covid edited.

BULL27|The stock is acting well as it is built a bullish base and our base plan to digest the recent and strong rally from March and 2020 loads from just under 300 shares $300 a share.
BULL28|On the downside, the Bulls want to see a stock continued trading above the old chart Heights of $423.00 a share.
NEUT29|So upside the Bulls are.
NEUT30|Welcoming price of ship of $545.00.
