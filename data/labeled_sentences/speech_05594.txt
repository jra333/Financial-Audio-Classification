NEUT0|"""Welcome to Sterling stocks today and be talking to you about ticker symbol PONGF."
NEUT1|I'm not a financial advisor so do what you will with this information.
NEUT2|Be sure to let him subscribe if you have already, I really appreciate it.
NEUT3|I'm going to be talking to you today about the PC slash console.
NEUT4|I do have other Atari videos that cover the hotel in depth and then I have one that kind of quick touch bases on casino token.
NEUT5|Basically everything they have in the works form later tonight or tomorrow.
NEUT6|I'm going to post one covering the token and casino.
NEUT7|So be on the lookout for that so it is a piece of PC console.
NEUT8|I'm more intrigued by the PC part than console console basically is going to be intriguing for nostalgia Atari fans in my opinion, but you can also play PC games on this.
NEUT9|I will get into that more in just a bit, so just real quick.
NEUT10|You can play new and retro including Atari classics.
NEUT11|They have about 150 of AM in this vault thing right here, so there's where the nostalgia factor is going to come in.
NEUT12|It's going to be able to play in 4K resolution, so that's going to be the main selling point for the console piece.
NEUT13|In this I believe anyone who didn't get to experience, or anyone who really loved guitar is going to probably buy this.
NEUT14|The new Atari controller is pretty cool.
NEUT15|It has nostalgia factor from these LED lights 'cause the old one used to have just an orange ring and they kind of go in motion to like when you're moving the remote and other stuff in the game.
NEUT16|Like getting shot and whatnot so the unique PC mode upgradable RAM in storage.
NEUT17|So that's what's huge to me about this.
NEUT18|If we go to 1st, we'll start here.
NEUT19|It's going to have Chrome.
NEUT20|Gmail Calendar chat docs, social media and emails blah blah blah.
NEUT21|So basically mini computer with Chrome setup, but if we see here we go to PC mode it says that users will be able to install and boot their own choice of operating systems.
NEUT22|So it currently supports these right here.
NEUT23|This Tim one is really big because it has a lot of computer games on it.
NEUT24|If you are a PC player, so I think that is where this is going to come in, 'cause it's already said that it's upgradable.
NEUT25|So if you don't want to tinker with it, I understand why you might not necessarily go crazy for this, but if you are a tinker and want to be able to expand a PC, I think you can make a pretty cool little mini computer where you can play games for basically your 200 or $400 purchase an you got the.
NEUT26|Classics at your fingertips.
NEUT27|So I think this is still a good buy preorders right now for 400 that comes with remotes and stuff.
NEUT28|So it's like a bundle deal.
NEUT29|I I think this is going to be a pretty big hit just because there's a ton of old Atari fans out there who are going to be interested in buying this and just the the appeals to the younger group because it's kind of like the switch where it's like a 211 type thing, but more so two in one because it's really a PC and console at Switch, just has a can play on TV and handheld so keep that in mind.
BULL30|I think we're going to be trading over Dollar really soon, probably easily in next week, and hold it if we consolidate a little bit under a dollar.
NEUT31|I want to be worried.
BULL32|Still, a good entry point in my opinion.
NEUT33|If you're looking for the long term, hold.
NEUT34|Like I said, I have a couple of other videos.
NEUT35|I'll leave him in the description.
NEUT36|Be sure to check him out.
NEUT37|I'll make a one either sometime this weekend, I will say.
NEUT38|Covering the token and casinos, so be on the lookout for that.
NEUT39|Be sure to let him describe.
BULL40|"It helps me out a whole bunch, so I'll see y'all next time."""
