NEUT0|"""So this is the OPEC plus meeting."
NEUT1|Now the OPEC meeting was Monday.
BEAR2|They did not get anything done.
NEUT3|The OPEC plus, which is OPEC plus Russia and a bunch of other nations like Mexico and Kazakhstan and others was supposed to meet Tuesday to sort of ratify the deal that all got delayed because of no deal.
NEUT4|Now they're meeting today.
NEUT5|So let's play.
NEUT6|Let's make a deal.
NEUT7|Global oil version, shall we?
NEUT8|So if you're behind on your OPEC plans and I don't blame you if you are, here's the current plan.
BEAR9|They cut production by 10 million barrels a day.
NEUT10|When the world collapsed back in late March, then they brought on two more million barrels a day.
BULL11|The plan currently is to raise output by 1.9 billion barrels per day starting January 1st.
NEUT12|Currently, the cut is 7.7 you go down 1.9, you get whatever it is.
BULL13|It's a de facto production increase, however many OPEC members do not believe that production increase is possible.
BEAR14|Still weak global demand.
BEAR15|So the Saudis and some others want to scuttle the current plan.
NEUT16|And keep the current cut level going 7.7 million barrels a day for three more months.
NEUT17|January, February, March.
NEUT18|We're going to meet today with Russia to try to hammer that out.
NEUT19|OK, why do you care?
NEUT20|Well here you go.
NEUT21|Three real outcomes and what is likely to happen to oil and oil prices.
NEUT22|Number one.
NEUT23|Extend the current cuts.
NEUT24|In other words, come to a deal.
NEUT25|Russia blesses it.
NEUT26|We move on.
NEUT27|That's priced in.
BULL28|Oil is actually firmed up oil stocks red hot November.
NEUT29|Here's what I think is likely to happen.
NEUT30|This would be the Sullivan selection guys.
BULL31|They're going to extend some of the cuts OK, but they're going to allow certain producers to either produce a little bit more or they're going to taper it in through January, February, March.
NEUT32|Kind of complicate the issue.
NEUT33|Maybe ramp up Tord March?
NEUT34|Or you get this?
NEUT35|You get no deal, right?
NEUT36|If there is no deal, they walk out.
NEUT37|Well, virtually walk out guys.
BEAR38|You're probably going to see oil fall five or more bucks per barrel today.
NEUT39|Oil stocks get whacked and you might have a global price war.
NEUT40|That last one is very unlikely, but not impossible to big intrigue side stories here in OPEC number one, the UAE, United Arab Emirates, right?
NEUT41|Big member there.
BEAR42|They've been pressing the Saudis internally to a lot of them produce more or get compensated for their cuts.
NEUT43|Little Saudi UAE rift.
NEUT44|In other words going on and then Russia which is likely cheating on the current plan, 'cause they pretty much always do is coming in with a little more heat.
NEUT45|Remember the Energy minister, Alexander Novak, was promoted.
NEUT46|He's now Deputy Prime Minister.
BEAR47|Of all of Russia, so Putin shadow is looming even larger over OPEC.
NEUT48|Plus not the same not being there.
BULL49|Andrew, but lot of entry.
NEUT50|Not sure when we'll get the decision today.
NEUT51|Hopefully we will get a decision today.
NEUT52|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT53|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
