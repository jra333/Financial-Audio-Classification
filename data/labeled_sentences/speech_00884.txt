NEUT0|"""But I have a very special guest with me, Mr. Pierce."
NEUT1|Under he's an options trade off and he's one of the guests who has, uh, in fact, uh, punched in big trades on the sidelines of for the traders carnival.
NEUT2|Miss assume that thanks for taking the time out and speaking with Bloomberg Quint.
NEUT3|First and foremost, bullish or bearish on the market today, I've taken a bullish view, OK?
NEUT4|And what's the bullish view trade that you've executed?
NEUT5|I sold put options Bank NIFTY 25600 pushups, and 2500 production.
NEUT6|And 25400 production or like Shodan, where are you expecting the bank Nifty to expire or on Thursday Street?
NEUT7|I'm not sure where it will expire but I'm sure it will not expire below 25625 six hundred.
NEUT8|OK, so that's a bullish view from your side.
NEUT9|While we were chatting on the sidelines, you told me that you don't put a stop loss.
NEUT10|What's the rationale behind that?
NEUT11|Rationally simple, because the bank nifty is going to expire today.
NEUT12|It's a weekly expiry and the time value will be in your favor, so I don't put that predetermines ******* but I just take a call as I'm in the market moves and most of the time I tend to hatch it by selling the call options in case if the market falls an so in case of very panic.
NEUT13|Situation only I put a stop loss.
NEUT14|I come out sure.
NEUT15|Can you give us a background of the strategy?
NEUT16|Why are you bullish today?
NEUT17|Is it be 'cause the market was down a few days or what?
NEUT18|What kind of parameters have you looked at before punching in the bullish order?
NEUT19|We look at many parameters.
NEUT20|OK, the number one.
BEAR21|As you said you know the markets have been down for the last few days.
BEAR22|In Frank yesterday, the bank Nifty future closed at 131 point discount to their spot price.
BEAR23|And we just totally unusual and there was not much of a face selling yesterday in cash market.
NEUT24|They sold it but not very big amount.
BEAR25|Annual switches were down when we closed yesterday, but U.S. markets open negative but later on recovered all the losses and closed in positive territory.
NEUT26|So these are the factors why I have to get bullish here today.
BULL27|So thank you so much for taking the time out.
NEUT28|I'm speaking with Bloomberg, Quint.
NEUT29|Mr PR sooner is bullish on the market.
NEUT30|In fact, has you know bullish positions on the nifty bank?
BULL31|"And certainly the way the market has gone so far, the trades are in his favor."""
