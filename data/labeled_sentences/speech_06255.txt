NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another very eventful day here on Amazon.
BEAR5|The downtrend continues.
NEUT6|I mean just.
NEUT7|Lower high after lower high after lower high and now the price is sitting at a very interesting location and this interesting location.
NEUT8|I do not want to come across as some sort of secret discovery on my partner that I have some sort of special skill to a found the secret location.
NEUT9|The exact opposite.
NEUT10|I assure you.
NEUT11|People that use charts and understand charts are watching this area an I bring all that up because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT12|Called a self filling prophecy cover you want it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements and that is exactly what we have with this area right here.
NEUT13|At.
NEUT14|The 3030 mark.
NEUT15|So let's go through the history of the chart right here.
NEUT16|And again, I'm talking, generally speaking, not 3030, on the exact dot.
NEUT17|I mean, we're talking about $3000 stock, right?
NEUT18|But 3030?
NEUT19|Right here you can see behaved as support you Fast forward to today, just a whole bunch of times behaved as support.
NEUT20|So my point here is this that there's, well, there's no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT21|It is more than valid.
BEAR22|It's a more than rational thought to be having that if the price goes sideways and eventually breaks down through that 3030 area, that could very well create another surge of downside selling.
BEAR23|Pressure and then just continue to push down the overall trend that's already been in place right here again.
NEUT24|Not guaranteed to happen, but certainly a more than valid thought to have in the event that level does not quite hold up.
NEUT25|The next key level of support to keep an eye on would then be down there right around the 2960 Mark.
BULL26|Now in the event the price decides it wants to bounce back up.
NEUT27|What about areas of resistance?
NEUT28|First key area resistance than any sort of upward bounce can be right here at the 3075 mark and then after 3075 next key level after that.
NEUT29|Right up there around 3145, so keep trying these technical levels going forward and let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|Going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer session.
