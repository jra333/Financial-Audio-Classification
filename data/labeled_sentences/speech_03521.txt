BULL0|"""Hey guys and girls, hope you're doing very well."
NEUT1|Just a quick update on gold for it in February 2021.
NEUT2|Guys as you know that I did my analysis for 17 February and I did said that the next target is 1775 and Luckily it hits 1774 which is our support two as well as you can see this is the support level I have drawn for myself.
NEUT3|Apart from that one my would be analyzed doing giving you an idea about 18 February which is on how it might move further.
NEUT4|Now as you can see that it moved.
BEAR5|Towards the retracement, but it it's currently at the lowest point, which was yesterday not yesterday's, but last month's lowest point.
NEUT6|I will just tell you the exact date it is currently at the lowest point of 4th February 2021.
BEAR7|So almost the same month it touched the same level of lowest one currently as as its trading at 1782.
BEAR8|But I'm expecting further drop.
BEAR9|If it breaches in next 4 hours, this support level of 1775, I would expect a further dropped and the next support level that we are seeing is.
NEUT10|That the next support level that we are seeing is around 1720 or 1700, so that's the strongest support that I would see.
BULL11|Currently I'm bearish on the momentum, so I would expect to form further bullish momentum.
NEUT12|It can take one or two days.
NEUT13|I would expect it until Friday.
BULL14|It might reach 1740 as well.
NEUT15|That's all from me.
NEUT16|From trade with the same.
NEUT17|I wish you very good luck with your trading before I leave my finish my analysis, I would ask those people who want to know about the analysts daily we have.
