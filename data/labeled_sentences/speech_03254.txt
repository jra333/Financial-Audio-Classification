BULL0|"""Welcome back to a brand new video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about the fire Red four.
NEUT2|Are they going to go up or are they going to go down in price?
NEUT3|I know a lot of people got pairs.
NEUT4|This was a shoe that was in a crazy amount of stock.
NEUT5|Let's start with Mens first, because men's.
NEUT6|I know a lot of you guys probably got Mens pairs.
NEUT7|If you got Mens pairs you can hold them, but it's going to take awhile for them to actually go up.
NEUT8|I can see is somewhat similar trend to bread force.
NEUT9|These are going to be about 20 to 30% less than what bread Forza right now and I think bread fours are out about.
NEUT10|50 to 500.
NEUT11|So then these are probably going to settle at 3:50 to 400, but that's not going to be.
NEUT12|I don't think for another like 6 to 8 months.
NEUT13|So what I would do if I was in his position, I didn't get any pairs, but if I were to invest into them, I would buy into them in five months, right?
NEUT14|Five months, they're probably still going to be 240 buy into them in five months.
BEAR15|There's going to be a lot less pairs on the market within that three month period from five months to around 8 months.
BULL16|There should be a lot of growth in those three months.
NEUT17|So you buy a bunch of pairs five months from now, wait that three months, and in those three months there should be a lot of growth.
NEUT18|I've done this with a lot of past investments.
NEUT19|I don't remember the exact shoes that I've done it.
NEUT20|I think it was like the white cement 4, but this was awhile ago and I did it for a few others.
NEUT21|I can't exactly remember, but I think history is going to repeat itself with these as well, and I think the same thing will happen, but they won't go as high as bread for, so right?
NEUT22|So to kind of summarize, don't buy that many pairs right now, maybe even try and sell them.
NEUT23|Put your money elsewhere five months from now.
NEUT24|Buying to them.
NEUT25|Put it on your calendar.
NEUT26|Do whatever you need to remind yourself, and then there should be a three month period where they should be going to three 400 plus, probably not over 400, but I think over 300 and then for grade school.
NEUT27|Do you want to invest into these right now?
NEUT28|I think so.
BULL29|I definitely think so.
NEUT30|I think you want to get size 5 and a half to size 7.
NEUT31|A lot of girls are starting to jump on the trend of Jordan Fours, and I think there's going to be a lot of them starting to wear them now.
NEUT32|And if you're going to invest in the pairs, get 5 1/2 to 7, because if we look at the bread for in a size 5 1/2 to 7, those are all going for three, 3300, three, 7357, so six and a half is 370 in grade school bread force.
NEUT33|The fired floors are 160, so that should be a good sign to buy 5 1/2 to 7 for the 160 and then you can just hold them.
NEUT34|It's a pretty cheap bind similar to the black and Gold Jordan ones in grade school so.
NEUT35|I would definitely say get grade school sizes.
BULL36|It should be a good investment and yeah, that's it for today's video.
BULL37|Thank you so much for watching.
NEUT38|If you want to get my book, use code Cyber Monday right here at sneakerinvest.com.
NEUT39|If not, that's OK.
NEUT40|I'm going to do a prediction every day of the week.
NEUT41|So see you guys tomorrow as well.
NEUT42|"Peace."""
