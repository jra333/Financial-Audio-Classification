BEAR0|"""Hey team, it's kind of late."
NEUT1|It's about 11:00 PM on the 21st of October and I just wanted to quick video and Apple would still follow up.
NEUT2|You know, we're just getting a lot of people out there talking about selling off and you know, we can.
NEUT3|We can talk about the stimulus, we know what it's doing to the market.
BEAR4|We know it's bringing volatility.
BULL5|But guys, we've consolidated.
NEUT6|We failed.
NEUT7|We consolidated we we don't need to consolidate anymore in this one 1260 lower range.
NEUT8|You know, let's the market sells off, you know?
NEUT9|Then?
BULL10|Obviously yeah, Apple will tank.
NEUT11|But you know, look, we have this upwards direction.
NEUT12|We talked about how it flat and then now we have the 20 day average going up and look at each day.
NEUT13|You know we have this gravestone doji.
NEUT14|Just happens to be green but look at the low the low tables one sixteen 45.
NEUT15|Where is the 20 day moving average today it's right right right all over here 161 sixteen 43 then we had yesterday the low yesterday was one 1563 where is the basis of that?
NEUT16|If you look on the right well I have this hovered over it.
NEUT17|One 1594 same thing here.
NEUT18|Massive red candle right two days ago.
NEUT19|What was the low one?
NEUT20|1566 What's the 20 day moving average which is the basis point?
NEUT21|The middle point of the Bollinger band One 1566?
NEUT22|So as long as we're trading in within this middle to upper range and we have this direction and theory, we're still bullish stock once we trade below it and we close below it.
NEUT23|And we're trading below this 20 day average, then we can start saying, like, yeah, we're getting the bears.
NEUT24|So I get it.
BEAR25|There's a sell off.
BULL26|This was a pump and dump from the iPhone event, but you know, we're look we're still holding pretty strong on this upwards momentum and so.
BEAR27|You know we have had this sell off.
BEAR28|We've had this reduction in price, but we've already had this massive consolidation.
BULL29|So with that said, I expect that we will get a bounce.
BULL30|We may go sideways, but I still expect that we're going to get balance.
NEUT31|I've just heard people say things like, you know we're going to 100 and it's going to fail and yadda yadda.
NEUT32|So I like to keep things simple.
NEUT33|Super simple.
BULL34|OK, so expect the balance and we'll get the channel to expand and get back on this upper band like we were here where we were just forming there.
NEUT35|Band and then it failed.
NEUT36|So now we're back.
NEUT37|Sort of in this channel.
BULL38|Alright guys, good luck.
NEUT39|"I'll talk to you soon."""
