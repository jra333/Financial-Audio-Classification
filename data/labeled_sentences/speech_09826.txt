NEUT0|"""He saw investors and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So we're going to talk about Genius brands.
NEUT2|OK, this is a very hot penny stock because if you guys don't know literally last week, yes and see that it was like around $2.00.
NEUT3|So we go back a little bit before that and the beat of the year on January.
NEUT4|It was $3 men and then this talk slowly going back down again.
BULL5|But if we push back even more, yes and see that this was back.
NEUT6|You know last summer was like around almost eight $9 which is crazy.
NEUT7|So let me explain to you guys what is going on with this stock.
NEUT8|Is it still a good time to buy?
NEUT9|Or should you sell now before I continue to say yes in short video straight to the point, like this, drop a like subscribe and turn on those post certifications.

NEUT11|Now let's talk about genius brands and what is going on.
NEUT12|OK so genius brand if you guys don't know it has to do with you know the entertainment of children.
BULL13|OK they've been doing an amazing job.
NEUT14|You know being able to create content for kids.
NEUT15|If you guys don't know they have their own app and when they launched at the start you know started going up.
NEUT16|Yes, go to the Play Store or Apple Store whatever.
NEUT17|Yes which are which are when you guys have you search up genius brand, you guys will find the app and this app pretty much has, you know shows for free.
NEUT18|It's like Netflix for free and then your kids can watch it with that was a huge success for them.
BULL19|You know their stocks started to go up.
NEUT20|They also partner up with LG, know to just have the app right there for kids.
BULL21|You know that also helped them out.
NEUT22|They were working with, you know like this whole show with family and you know some other celebrities were also invested into this company.
BEAR23|Now you see right now it is pretty low.
NEUT24|Usually how this penny stock works when they announce anything there, so goes up right away.
NEUT25|But the moment that we don't hear any news for quite some time, this is what happens.
NEUT26|You know, it slowly starts to go back down.
NEUT27|That's how this thought goes.
NEUT28|I've been talking about this song for over a year now.
NEUT29|OK, you know, I will talk about Genius brand before you know.
NEUT30|Back in like February, yes, can check out my silent Investor channel.
NEUT31|I've always been talking bout jeans brand.
NEUT32|I always notice that when this song goes up.
NEUT33|You know it goes back down right away because you know there's no news.
NEUT34|So in my opinion, definitely buy the dips when it's low, hold onto it, and then when it goes up you know definitely sell.
NEUT35|But once again, not financial advisors offering training purposes.
NEUT36|Do not take anything serious that I'm saying it is your money, so know how to invest your money, but that's how I've been investing in Genius brands.
