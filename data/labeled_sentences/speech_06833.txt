BEAR0|"""Soon as you got 6.82%, I hated AT&T forever."
NEUT1|I sold it actually around this price.
NEUT2|I almost feel like re buying it because they're going to be stupid and start giving premiums to every streaming service here.
BEAR3|Probably TNT is all their other businesses **** so I was just saying though, it's it's becoming obvious now that at least based on the first six months, 18-8 people Max is falling very far behind their race.
NEUT4|Like Disney is catching up to Netflix and 18 HBO Max is not.
NEUT5|There are nowhere near they have.
NEUT6|Maybe there just to stay away from them?
NEUT7|Or is there a catch up trade here or not, yeah?
BEAR8|12 and a half million subscribers in six months they are so far behind Disney.
BEAR9|I mean company just cannot get it together there.
NEUT10|It's weird because we have Comcast.
NEUT11|We have Netflix and then Lisa wanted to watch this show on HBO.
NEUT12|HBO Max probably couldn't write.
NEUT13|Actually, she got it because we have a T&T for our phone service.
NEUT14|We have a house line.
NEUT15|Don't ask me why they threw that in.
NEUT16|So through her iPad on our TV we got a really smart TV.
BEAR17|We were able to watch it and we don't and through and I don't know if they're going to hit us up later for some kind of, but it's confusing his house.
NEUT18|I think it's just maybe go with the blanket approach that Dennis is talking about just by older streamers.
NEUT19|I don't know if you're gonna start getting at that story gets hot and I believe it will.
NEUT20|In 2021 we will talk about predicting news flow.
NEUT21|I am saying and it's not a bold call that they're going to be talking a lot about streaming in 2021.
NEUT22|So you got Disney on Netflix.
NEUT23|You're going top to House Peacock?
NEUT24|Does anybody use Peacock Comcast so early?
NEUT25|It's not really the but the thing with HBO is it wasn't available on.
NEUT26|Roku wasn't available on Amazon.
NEUT27|The launch was bungled.
NEUT28|It was.
NEUT29|They have all these brands was confusing that Israel Max if you go.
NEUT30|If you're now in, Peacock is too young.
NEUT31|I think.
NEUT32|I don't know what kind of data we have on that.
NEUT33|We like him young because then they grow.
NEUT34|It matches Mitch just popped in.
NEUT35|He's above the story.
NEUT36|He said yes.
NEUT37|This year they will talk to me about the streaming story.
BEAR38|Then as I had already talked to you about it, you got food Boo.
BULL39|Remember well, I know that's a good one.
NEUT40|I'm still at it.
NEUT41|Where do I sell out?
NEUT42|I just hold on to that.
NEUT43|Select always, I'd like to bring you guys a story that I'm looking at.
NEUT44|I'm actually looking at a different play in the streaming services.
NEUT45|I got my pen ready look so I love Mentry school's what I'm going to look for is MGNINGTD.
NEUT46|What's the other one?
NEUT47|And TTD on the trade desk?
NEUT48|So these are two that are move making moves in Pro Matic.
NEUT49|Add tools and things that you're going to see with the streaming services is is how do they get the ads to you because one of the biggest things that you're seeing in streaming is now.
NEUT50|How my gonna go ahead an personalize these ads for the viewer that's watching so I think you really gotta watch for these companies.
NEUT51|Which one is the leader?
NEUT52|I really haven't done that much research so I'm going to go ahead and do that for you guys.
NEUT53|But I think these two plays you gotta keep an eye out and look for other plays in the Pro Matic ad space for streaming.
NEUT54|Awesome and again obviously there's been some people on this trade 'cause November MGN I was ten.
NEUT55|It's now 20 but maybe this goes on the watch for, you know the pull back.
NEUT56|I mean this is about what markets are about my opinion and get your list of stocks your Christmas shopping list.
NEUT57|And then you wait for you know the market correction you wait for, you know where everybody is like.
NEUT58|OK, I want the hell out of this thing and then you strike with your list.
NEUT59|So much is giving you a couple stocks that's on his Christmas shopping list.
NEUT60|MG anion TTD.
NEUT61|Maybe they just run straight up.
NEUT62|Maybe you missed some.
NEUT63|You know what.
NEUT64|There's always another trade, and that's what a lot of traders newer traders really struggle with.
NEUT65|I see it all the time I missed this trait and they and they focus on it and it's eating up their mental capital.
NEUT66|Not even that they lost money, but that they missed this trade that they knew about.
NEUT67|And you know, once you're a season trader, you'll be able to look past that and say, you know what?
NEUT68|I missed that one.
NEUT69|"There will be another one tomorrow because there's always another trade."""
