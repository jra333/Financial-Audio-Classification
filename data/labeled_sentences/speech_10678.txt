BEAR0|"""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, addressing concerns over his junior employees workload after results from an internal survey went viral."
BEAR1|One employee called conditions.
NEUT2|In Humane I know where you stand on this gym, but what's interesting about the story is it does put in perspective the fine line.
NEUT3|Some leaders of these organizations have to walk because the world is not the one that you grew up in, or frankly, even that I grew up and it's different now.
BEAR4|And so Mr. Solomon is sort of taking pains at least to sort of address some of their complaints over heightened workloads and things of that nature.
BEAR5|He did have a message to employees after the results of that internal survey came out, and these are somewhat unusual working conditions right now.
NEUT6|There is even when you're working crazy hours in an office.
NEUT7|At least there's there's camaraderie you know instead of sitting at home alone.
NEUT8|Zooming in, all that's good, but you know what, David?
NEUT9|You said that things have changed from your time in my time, but let me ask you something.
NEUT10|Have the customers change.
NEUT11|I mean, remember, Goldman's customer centric with good friends always customer centric.
NEUT12|And if they're asking for what I might regard as being something crazy over the weekend on Friday, well, then you have to work.
NEUT13|It's the customer that drives a lot of this, right?
NEUT14|And it's not as though these these younger people are not working.
NEUT15|Many of them are working as they said 100 hours and I know someone who is number one of the customers wanted very successful questions.
NEUT16|One is something Sunday, right Sunday evening, right?
NEUT17|And so someone who's working on that deal doesn't have the young person doesn't have the ability to say you know what?
BEAR18|I I'm not working because that customer is wrong.
NEUT19|So I think a lot of it's customer driven and we're not.
BEAR20|We're leaving that out and I think that's a shame.
NEUT21|I mean look yes, I.
NEUT22|During my year I. I felt that a lot of it was my mom.
NEUT23|You know there were people who, like me, felt that if we train people so that when the customer called you would do what they want.
NEUT24|Then I think that you don't understand.
NEUT25|It was really about trying to get people to be ready for a customer who is insatiable.
NEUT26|But David, the customers haven't changed that much and if they want business done over the weekend then it gets done right and it does.
NEUT27|And many of these younger people listen that is part of the job when you're in associate one of these places.
NEUT28|You typically should be expected.
BEAR29|Or expect that your workload is going to be enormous, and you're probably only going to get 4 hours, 5 hours of sleep a night, most nights and some nights.
NEUT30|You may even have to work on all night or it's funny because my court of friends now many of their kids are in these kinds of jobs, and so I do hear about it not just to Goldman, but you know at any number of these and they're all working really hard.
NEUT31|Yes, all of them are.
NEUT32|There's a lot of not in the office, which again is part of the problem here, and it's you see what Solomon had to say in terms of remote work.
NEUT33|And you know.
NEUT34|Providing support and saying it's not easy now.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
