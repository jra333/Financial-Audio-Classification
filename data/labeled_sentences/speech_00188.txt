NEUT0|"""Hello, one last look at the Apple stock we can see here today it has formed a green candle."
NEUT1|This green candle has a smaller volume.
NEUT2|It means the.
NEUT3|Trump is not very strong.
BEAR4|The momentum is not very strong so we can see here the high actually has been involved in line 5-6 is well below the high on here, so it means it's still within the consolidation area is not a breakthrough, is not.
NEUT5|A breakout is only I bounce back.
NEUT6|So be careful regarding to this volume is not a reversal.
NEUT7|So hold your money.
BULL8|Here, this green candle only means the Apple stock has been steady here.
BULL9|But study doesn't mean it will definitely break out to a new high.
NEUT10|So in my opinion.
NEUT11|It has been trading in this range for.
BEAR12|Several weeks, so it's very hard for it to break out.
NEUT13|From here we can see the the high, low or high this high is hiring here and this high is hard in here.
NEUT14|It's very exciting.
NEUT15|So if we connect the top so here we can see.
NEUT16|Actually.
BEAR17|They nearly formed a downtrend, so it's still apparent sign for it.
NEUT18|And as long as the price.
NEUT19|Trading in this range so we can see actually.
NEUT20|Here's nearly a triangle form.
NEUT21|So as I as long as the price trading between this range, we can see there's no big direction change for the stock.
BULL22|"Thank you very much."""
