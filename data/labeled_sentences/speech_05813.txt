BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to the channel today."
NEUT1|We're going to be doing a Rocket League investment video.
NEUT2|I'm recording this while I'm on PS4, so these will be more PS4 related, but some of them might be relatable to you know if you're on Xbox as well.
NEUT3|So in this case and straight in with the investment number one.
NEUT4|So investment number one is going to be Crimson and Sky blue Fenwick.
NEUT5|As you can see on the spreadsheet.
BEAR6|But there they have dropped a lot and Fenwick is a very popular car so I can definitely see this going bucket back up in value.
BULL7|As you know Fenwick is popular and the Crimson Octane and Sky blue octane have gone up as well, so there's quite a bit of hope of the Crimson Sky Blue Fenwick so I can see them coming up in the next couple of weeks.
NEUT8|And yeah, this column was investment #2.
NEUT9|Here we get into investment number 2 and this is going to be in dueling Dragons.
BEAR10|As you can see it peaked at 5000 credits and it's just been continually dropping and now it started to rise again.
NEUT11|And this is a very popular goal explosion.
BULL12|I can see this rising in the future.
NEUT13|It may take awhile to rise.
NEUT14|Not as quick as the octanes 'cause it is.
NEUT15|Slight is popular, but it's not as popular.
BULL16|So yeah, and a good investment, but there's more to come and better one.
NEUT17|Investment #2 is going to be this white dominice R Us yes.
BEAR18|As you can see it's just dropped a ton but look at this, it peaked at 12,000 credits and then nine and now it's 2600 so so it's gonna rise back up.
NEUT19|Might be a little less.
NEUT20|Could there be more, but still you know getting it for probably for 2K now and you know if it rises back up, then that's going to be a lot of profit, but it is going to take some time to rise back up and also with these are OCS drops when the drops get announced.
NEUT21|Which.
NEUT22|I don't know when that's going to be, but when the new drops for the new season get announced.
NEUT23|Things like emeralds if they're not in the drops, they're going to rise massively.
NEUT24|Probably triple their value, and that's with other things.
BEAR25|So things that are discontinued from the drops, they're just going to rise so much an yes.
NEUT26|So think about that when investing in things up to the next investment.
BEAR27|These are going to be the last two investments state, but we have big splash which was incredibly high, and now's really cheap and we have tea white ballistic, which is dropped quite a lot, but with both of these items they were really high and they've just dropped and they haven't started to rise yet, so.
NEUT28|You know that big splash, especially that's very popular and I can see that rising in it.
NEUT29|You can probably buy it for 500 credits now, which is incredibly cheap, and so that's probably almost instant profit when it starts rising again.
NEUT30|So that's going to be it for today's investment video.
