BEAR0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for February 5th, 2018 and Christina Bethany, investment analyst at exam.com, and today we're going to look at Dollar Yen on the daily chart so dollar yen gain momentum last week, rising back to the 110 key level and find resistance at the 20 day moving average on Friday and today is currently weaker at 109.85."
NEUT1|The bank right though.
BEAR2|Remains bearish in the bigger picture, the Paris below the McLeod near 3 1/2 month lows.
BEAR3|The 20 day moving average is far below the 50 day and 200 day moving average lines, which means that now the market might maintain this down like for awhile.
BEAR4|But based on momentum indicators down here, the market might maintain might see some upside movements in the near term or at least some software decreases their size.
BULL5|Embarrassed territory, but it's moving.
BULL6|Towards the neutral zone of 50, Mcatee has rise and above its signal line.
NEUT7|Now looking for support levels.
BULL8|The market could retest.
NEUT9|The previous Lord 108.27.
BULL10|If it manages to break below 109.78, which is the 23.6% fibo Nachi of the download from 114.72 to 108.27, then further below the market could meet the critical support at 107.31 which we've broken.
BULL11|It will turn the pair from neutral to bearish.
NEUT12|In the longer term.
BEAR13|Now the worst scenario if this happens prices could also move towards the 106 key level.
BEAR14|However, the pair shifts to the upside immediate resistance could come from the 20 day moving average at 110.24.
BULL15|Then from 110.74, which is another 38.2% people Nachi, but the pair needs to break above the 50% at 110 eleven point 48 to confirm that the bullish phase has started.
BULL16|In the short term, while an move above the 50 day moving average and the 200 day moving average at 111.70 would signal that prices have a bigger chance to return to 113 zone, now turning to the medium term picture, the outlook is bearish as long as prices keep trading below the 50% fibo Nachi.
NEUT17|In this case only above above 114.72.
NEUT18|Would bring bullish prospects back into focus, so that's all for me.
BULL19|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
