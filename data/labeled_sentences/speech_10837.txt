NEUT17|So look doggy Quincy right now is currently like at 5 you know five cents almost reaching 6 sensitive like this for the past week yes and see that you know slowly it's been going up almost to six cents and then going back down to you know almost like $0.05 and it continues like that and there's one reason why it's been like that for quite some time now.
NEUT18|Yes, and see that you know almost all of March is been like at $0.05 and then it drops to six and it goes up to six and then back to five.
NEUT19|Well, The thing is, it's been a week since Elon must actually tweet in anything about this crypto.
NEUT20|Yes, and see if we scroll up.
NEUT21|You know, he hasn't been talking about it.
NEUT22|There aren't any news at the moment about it.
NEUT23|So yes, you can see we could keep scrolling down.
NEUT24|We keep going down and you guys can see until like literally, like about a week ago you can see he starts talking about, you know, Dodge coin, you know, talking a little bit about it, you know dog day afternoon and stuff like that.
NEUT25|But at the moment there aren't any crazy.
NEUT26|News, so just in my opinion, my prediction would be that we really won't see huge movements of, you know this crypto right here.
NEUT27|Mainly because you know Elon Musk is the one that you know.
NEUT28|You started as a meme and people actually started to buy this crypto.
NEUT29|If you guys don't know this critter was made just for fun, but that's the reason why right now this crypto is not really going up, but let me know down in the comments section below.
NEUT30|What do you guys think about this one?
NEUT31|Is it still a by discussing it still going to reach a dollar by the end of the year?
BULL32|I actually believe it can definitely reach $0.10, but sometime in the future let me know, but I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT33|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on the next video."""
