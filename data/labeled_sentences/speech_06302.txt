NEUT2|I assume in the future, unless there's new PPE craze continues, it may well particularly cover hangs around or just simply standards change so you know there's there's reason to believe.
NEUT3|Maybe it has some sort of you know, ability to stay at these levels, but it's just really, really tough to stay in front.
BULL4|I think in this sort of industry I think you're you're a brave person to to hold this one for the long term just because, as I said, if everything goes well you do OK if anything goes badly at all, you probably do terribly.

NEUT9|"I wouldn't touch it."""
