BULL0|"""Now Berkshire Hathaway may report his best quarter in at least two years."
NEUT1|On Friday, the company's stock portfolio is valued at more than $60 billion.
NEUT2|Let's go to Bloomberg, Sarah Burton in New York for a closer look at that Zara.
NEUT3|So Berkshire back on form, maybe?
BEAR4|Well, maybe because remember it had its first loss in more than seven years in the first quarter, and that was partly because it made some bad bets on the direction of global stock markets with derivatives.
BEAR5|But because of the rally that we saw in stock since the March low, that's expected to reverse course.
NEUT6|Berkshire expected to report net income about $1.9 billion in the second quarter.
BULL7|Still a decline from last year, but a much better picture compared to the first quarter.
BULL8|If you look at some of Berkshire Stock Holdings, you can see why the earnings picture is expected to improve.
NEUT9|Just look at American Express that stock up about.
BULL10|71% in the second quarter.
BULL11|Wells Fargo as well, soaring about 70%.
BULL12|Goldman Sachs Group rose 39%.
BULL13|Burlington, Northern Santa Fe up by 22% so huge moves out.
NEUT14|Now Berkshire's own stock that rose about 3.8% in the in the in the quarter in the second quarter you can see here today it's about 11%.
NEUT15|It reached 100,000 this week.
BULL16|That's the highest we've seen since January.
BEAR17|Now it's still 28% off its record closing.
NEUT18|Though about 149 thousand dollars a share that was reached back in 2007.
NEUT19|Quite a move.
NEUT20|Quite something, what about the underlying businesses that Berkshire owns there?
NEUT21|Yeah, they definitely have a number of different businesses.
NEUT22|We have home building jewelry stores, jet leasing, disaster insurance and Buffett himself has said that Berkshires energy business and car insurer, GEICO.
BULL23|They're thriving amid this recession.
BULL24|Jewelry, though not doing so well.
NEUT25|Home building, not doing so well.
NEUT26|Which is the for the obvious reason.
BEAR27|And then airplane units have suffered as well.
NEUT28|You have net jets as a private jet business.
BEAR29|A lot of corporations cutting back on the use of these jets.
NEUT30|And of course the ones that can afford them, not really wanting to afford them, especially.
NEUT31|If they are in fact bailout candidates from government money.
BEAR32|And at the same time I was saying a private equity firms, which of course had a disastrous year much worse than the ordinary companies.
BULL33|But they've been returning to profit.
NEUT34|That's exactly right.
BEAR35|'cause it was a terrible time to be a money manager last year, especially when the direction was up for such a long time that there was the plunge that we signed stocks is really a downer for a lot of these investors in private equity firms.
BULL36|Now the return again of the stronger equity markets, certainly helping out Blackstone Group, which is run by Stephen Schwarzman.
BULL37|It had its first profit in a year.
NEUT38|Blackstone, able to mark up its private equity Holdings by about 3% after they mark them down by the same amount in the first quarter, the firm will still had to mark down it's real estate.
BEAR39|Holdings by 19% in the second quarter.
NEUT40|That may have something to do with the share sell off today.
BEAR41|Went down about 6%, but even though you saw this stock sell off in the court in today's training, it really has doubled so far this year.
NEUT42|And if you look at another buyout, firm Fortress Investment Group, just look at the run up in this stock, I mean 400% to the upside.
BULL43|They're up about 5% today.
BULL44|They reported second quarter earnings that beat estimates profit, bolstered by a 17% jump in assets under management.
NEUT45|During that.
NEUT46|Paul.
NEUT47|Yeah, as always with these, you've got to get him really early.
BULL48|I mean when you look at Blackstone is up 114% as you say year to date, but in the last 12 in the last three months only 12% all of that game was in the first few weeks.
NEUT49|So gotta be quick quick as these private equity guys are.
BULL50|"Thank you very much for that and Sarah's Burton there in New York now that."""
