NEUT0|"""Eric bought a good laptop awhile ago at the regular retail price, whereas John chose to wait and bought the same product at a 40% Black Friday discount."
NEUT1|Both now own a good laptop.
NEUT2|It's just that John bought it when it was, let's say, undervalued.
NEUT3|The same principle is valid when buying stocks as a value investor developed by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934 and popularized through Graham's famous book, The Intelligent Investor, that to this day.
NEUT4|Is even recommended by billionaires such as Warren Buffett.
NEUT5|Value investing simply revolves around trying to buy stocks that are trading below their quote, unquote intrinsic value.
NEUT6|In other words, value investors don't believe markets are efficient enough to include all available information in the current price in a rational manner.
NEUT7|Instead, just like contrarian investors in this respect, they go against the proverbial heard by identifying undervalued stocks based on metrics such as one, the PE or price to earnings ratio.
NEUT8|To identify profitable companies.
NEUT9|To the PB or Price to book ratio to identify asset rich companies, three free cash flow to identify companies with solid liquidity and so on.
NEUT10|It's important to understand that determining this intrinsic value is a subjective endeavor, which is why you might want a margin of safety.
NEUT11|For example, Graham recommends that you buy shares trading at 2/3 of the intrinsic value you've determined or less value investing can be adapted to other asset classes as well.
NEUT12|But before making decisions.
NEUT13|Please understand that perfect strategies don't exist.
NEUT14|Still, value investing can be a more than decent choice for patient investors who don't insist on picking hot assets or going with the flow.
NEUT15|Instead, they diligently research and wait for buying opportunities.
