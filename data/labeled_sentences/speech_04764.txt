NEUT0|"""In terms of the economy."
BULL1|We've had one really good quarter, which was the four handle on second quarter growth.
NEUT2|And we get some spillover and a lot of it is inventories in the third quarter, which is probably 3% plus.
NEUT3|But what would anybody really expect when we have arguably the most gargantuan fiscal stimulus plans?
NEUT4|Football point.
NEUT5|Of course there would be some initial response to the economy.
NEUT6|The question is, you know what happens.
NEUT7|In the coming year and what are the leading indicators really telling you?
NEUT8|You know we got the leading economic indicator from the from the Conference Board just yesterday, and you know when you look at the real site components in the post of the survey components.
NEUT9|Is the running flat?
BEAR10|You know the commentary on the economy surprised me because the real great leading indicator that we all know is housing, so I find it fascinating that we're hearing all this commentary and how great the economy is on the same day that existing home sales in September collapse almost 3 1/2 percent down, six months in a row, and over that six months is down to 15% annual rate.
NEUT11|And if you believe housing is a leading indicator, the economy.
BEAR12|Tell me that once we get past this fiscal sugar high, we're going to have quite a few problems next year in the macro front in 2019.
BULL13|Today, don't you have consumer incomes doing OK?
BEAR14|The PMI indexes are still, you know, not too far off their highs.
NEUT15|And also I mean how far ahead of the last recession did housing peak two years?
BULL16|Yeah, you're probably correct.
NEUT17|And 1000 million person didn't just speak in the last couple of months housing and the whole building stock be quite awhile ago.
BEAR18|And yeah, you're quite right about personal income doing better, but that will come at the expense of corporate income, so I think we're gonna have a significant margin squeeze on corporate profits from rising wage expense, rising interest rate, expand, select impacted the firm dollar, and don't think for a second that the impact of slowing growth will receive that.
NEUT19|We get to see the full impact on US corporate earnings.
BULL20|Yeah, I fully agree that we're going to see accelerating wage growth ahead, but there's no such thing as a free lunch.
BEAR21|We had weak wage growth for motorcycles and the gift that we got back with the fasting for novel and an ultra low interest rates.
NEUT22|The market.
NEUT23|Love that by the way, now we have a situation where I think the big surprise and it started with Amazon with 50% week site that will transmit itself right through the broad retail sector and beyond.
BULL24|And I think from a social perspective that's great news.
NEUT25|But Wall Street doesn't trade off of the social perspective that race off of ultimately interest rates which you have to use to discount the future cash flows to suppress it.
NEUT26|So the accelerating weight girls put the fan in the blocks.
NEUT27|They're probably gonna have to do quite a bit more than people expect, and so the follows from the great news on personal income means that interest rates are going to be going up, and that's going to be something brand spanking new aspect only along the reason why the markets have been so choppy this year, says the two year note yield a year ago was one point.
BEAR28|3% today is flirting just under 3%.
NEUT29|And if that industry pressure that's altered, all other asset classes globally this year is the shift of industry landscape.
NEUT30|That's going to continue over the course of the next six months.
BULL31|"Relief."""
