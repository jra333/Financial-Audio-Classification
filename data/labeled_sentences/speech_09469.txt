NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol CSCW."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another pull back here a little bit.
NEUT5|Nothing huge but you know nothing monstrous either.
NEUT6|In terms of you know upwards movement or anything of that nature.
NEUT7|But definitely some updates here need to be made now.
NEUT8|The one adjustment I am going to make here is moving this green line down here just a tad bit because now that we have more data from today, it's become apparent that this dollar 25 mark you know is going to be more so that true or level of support.
NEUT9|Which makes sense.
NEUT10|'cause actually this was the former breakout area right there?
NEUT11|Or in other words, a former resistance point.
NEUT12|And there is a foundational rule in charge in which states, when levels of resistance are broken and closed above.
NEUT13|You want to see them at their support, and that's exactly what happened right there.
NEUT14|So I mean, you could throw this right into a textbook if you wanted to have a classic example of resistance behaving as support.
NEUT15|But pointer being dollar 25 going to watch that level moving forward as an important level to hold up above from the support side of things.
NEUT16|But if the price does continue on up, then the first key levels to watch very closely.
NEUT17|Initial level going to be whoops, let me change that.
NEUT18|There we go.
NEUT19|We'll be right up there at a dollar.
NEUT20|It's $1.50 and then after $1.50.
NEUT21|If the price can break up through their next key level would then be right up there.
NEUT22|Around the Dollar 70 mark so Dollar $50.70 next couple of key battlegrounds to watch moving forward from the resistance side of things.
NEUT23|If it does start to turn around, but overall like I said, not a terrible day, but I mean by no means was it a monster state of the upside or anything like that either.
BEAR24|But just a consolidation day volume dropped off quite a bit so it'll be very interesting to see how this one closes out the week on Friday.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird.
NEUT30|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT31|But in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT37|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT39|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT40|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
