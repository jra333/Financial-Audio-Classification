BEAR0|"""We've had some pretty depressing housing numbers coming out."
NEUT1|Does this mean this recovery?
BULL2|We've all been hoping for is squelched well coming into the year.
NEUT3|I don't think anyone thought that 2012 was going to be the year that housing suddenly started going gangbusters again, and we got back to the peaks or anything like that.
BEAR4|That being said, we have seen some soft data lately pending home sales.
BEAR5|Yesterday's case, Shiller numbers, which are national home price measures, city by city, were disappointing and showed continued declines, which means we're still sort of bumping along the bottom here.
BULL6|There were signs for optimism.
BEAR7|Towards the end of last year we saw big run up in the market, particularly in housing focus names.
BULL8|You know, at this point it's hard to think that we're going to have that big rally in housing this year, but a little contribution from housing compared to the negatives that we've seen for the past four or five years would really be a big step in the right direction.
NEUT9|You mentioned the housing stocks and how they've appreciated, and they run in the market.
NEUT10|So does this mean it's time to get out of housing?
BULL11|Well, I think the market may have gotten a little ahead of itself.
NEUT12|You saw numbers recently from KB Home, and Lynn are both were.
NEUT13|Not great, not disasters, but you know a little bit disappointing.
NEUT14|In some ways.
BEAR15|KB Home at an hour or loss lenore's profit was down.
NEUT16|What you're seeing now is the home builders who can bounce around in different markets and who can go where.
NEUT17|There's a more of a housing, demand and construct homes there.
BULL18|They're going to be in better shape, but not everybody can do that.
NEUT19|It won't happen all at once.
NEUT20|This is a slow slog of a recovery in housing, and it's not something that you know these stocks are going to happen unabated.
NEUT21|Run higher, so after such a big charge.
NEUT22|You saw the same in Home Depot and Lowe's of late.
NEUT23|There's trading at much higher multiples than they were a few months ago, so it's going to be interesting to see whether this recovery in housing stocks has gotten too far ahead of itself.
NEUT24|Earning season that we're starting to get into now may give us some clues into that, so it's not necessarily a run for an exit.
NEUT25|Exits indicate indicator.
NEUT26|I don't think it's that yet.
BEAR27|You know if we start to get really awful reports.
NEUT28|If you know you know, Home Depot's and the lows of the world.
NEUT29|And these retailers say that they're not seeing the kind of home improvement spending that you would.
NEUT30|Expect to see at this period of the cycle you know that may be an indicator, but I don't think we're there yet.
BULL31|"Some kind of a pullback, most likely, but I don't know that we're in the bailout kind of mode yet for investors."""
