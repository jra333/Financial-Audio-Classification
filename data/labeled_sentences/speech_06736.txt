NEUT2|Hello friends, in this video which is part of our technical analysis series, we shall be looking at bullish and bearish engulfing candle stick patterns.
NEUT3|A bullish engulfing pattern, as you can see in this explanatory chart, occurs when a small dark candle is followed by a large light candle the next day in a manner where the large light candle completely in girls or covers or overlaps the small dark candle.
NEUT4|As you can see in this chart.
NEUT5|That is a small barrish red candle which is followed by a large bullish green candle the next day.
NEUT6|The chart looks such that the body of the green candle can completely cover and consume the body of the small red candle.
NEUT7|If this is seen in two alternated trading sessions, you call this a bullish, engulfing chart pattern.
NEUT8|This is a chart depicting bullish engulfing pattern.
NEUT9|You can see that there is a downtrend like the two parallel lines within which you can see the candles coming down.
BEAR10|There is a downtrend.
NEUT11|Where it is pointed, you can see a bearish candle and in number 4 you can see the bullish candle.
NEUT12|The manner in which is that the bullish candle will completely cover the previous day's small bearish candle.
NEUT13|And this bullish engulfing pattern indicates that the downtrend has come to an end and immediately you have an uptrend that starts.
NEUT14|Now let us look at something called as bearish, engulfing bearish engulfing is something that is completely opposite of the bullish engulfing in case of bearish engulfing.
NEUT15|You can see a small bullish candle which is followed the next day by a large barrish red candle.
NEUT16|As you can see in the chart.
NEUT17|The manner is suspected dark candle completely angles and overlaps the small green candle appearing the previous day.
