BEAR0|"""Exactly, we do have some breaking news from CVS Health."
NEUT1|The company says that it is now administered more than 10 million COVID-19 vaccine shots that includes doses given at long term care facilities and at CVS Pharmacies.
NEUT2|CVS says nearly 2000 of its stores are giving out shots in 44 states, Puerto Rico and Washington DC, and it says it now has the capacity to administer 25 million doses a month.
NEUT3|Of course, that would be reliant on if they had the supply and the permission to operate in all 50 states.
NEUT4|They do say that vaccine appointments from black, Hispanic, and Native American customers currently make up more than a third of all in store appointments, which CVS says is 12% above those groups baseline community representations.
NEUT5|That stock is trading at 7551, but it is a good glimpse into how things are really rolling out and how they're ramping up.
NEUT6|It's these supercenters where you're getting the vaccines, it's hospitals, but it's also all of these big box retailers.
NEUT7|Everything from CVS to Walgreens to Walmart.
NEUT8|Rite Aid, where they've been doing these vaccinations and making things more readily available in people's communities.
