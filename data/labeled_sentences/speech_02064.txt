NEUT0|"""Everyone couch investor here with another video for you today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about Coca Cola.
NEUT2|No, at the time of making this video, Coke is going at around about $59 and pays around $0.40 quarterly dividends.
BULL3|No couple of weeks ago it had its earnings and it went quite well.
NEUT4|Actually, it beats the revenue estimates and it equals the EPS which was around $0.44, which was what the street estimates were as well.
NEUT5|So during that earnings call, the starting really move, which is actually very surprising.
NEUT6|'cause usually when stock have their earnings, this card goes up or down most of the time it goes down but with Coke.
NEUT7|Apparently it does not.
BULL8|Now the Co James Quincy said that 2019 was a great year.
BULL9|They actually had a 7% organic growth, which is 2% more than what they're going for.
BULL10|They're always going for a 5% organic growth, so that went very good for them.
NEUT11|He's also saying that.
BULL12|He hopes the momentum keeps going in 2020, which I think shouldn't be a problem even with the concern of the coronavirus.
BEAR13|He says that it's too early to assess, but there are manufacturing is still running in China.
NEUT14|Obviously a couple of people don't come to work, but.
NEUT15|Everything goes as usual for Coke.
BULL16|Now important thing to know is that the Coke brand is still going strong, meaning.
NEUT17|The drinks everything they had in Coca Cola family is still popular, especially Coke Zero, which had double digit gains last year, which makes a bit of sense because everybody is going in their plant based burgers, vegan vegetarian, less sugary.
NEUT18|So obviously the dream that has zero sugar should be the most popular one and that's why it had double digit gains last year.
NEUT19|Coke also has the new Coke coffee and you will see at the end of this video I show you the Super Bowl ad where they presented than you.
NEUT20|Coke energy energy.
NEUT21|We all know Coke wants to enter the energy drink market with a Red Bull and monster an many others, but especially those two.
NEUT22|They are the major competitors.
NEUT23|No, as a conclusion I own Coke.
NEUT24|I own Coke for quite a while now.
NEUT25|It's no secret that Warren Buffett owns Coke, and millions and millions of dollars of it.
BULL26|It's a good stock to own, especially with this good dividend, and it's a they have a bright future in my opinion.
NEUT27|In the next video, we're going to talk about Facebook, the challenges of Facebook and what the future holds.
NEUT28|I think you should be going or in Facebook in the next couple of years.
