NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, I it's Jack my as usual speaking and based on technical analysis today I will try or we can see in front of us how the price will move next for this Nordstrom stock in one hour candle stick."
NEUT1|So our goal is to understand or to forecast the price movement as we can see the major trend has been drawn with blue line as usual and the prices are moving inside the channel so meaning that.
BEAR2|There is a lot of writing answer tenety around this discount or businesses that has been impacted by the coronavirus and the prices are still moving sideways without any signal of bullish or bearish market.
BULL3|So as, but based on these sideways trend more we can see eastate date, the prices are bouncing up, just bounced up.
NEUT4|Or able these support level so the idea or regarding these, Nordstrom is just to go long and always say they look to fundamental analysis and news around this brand.
