NEUT0|"""Going on everybody, my name is Mike."
NEUT1|This is Wall Street traders.
BULL2|We breakdown hot trading stocks, but you an advantage on the market.
NEUT3|But today's ticker symbol that we're breaking down is Disney or DIS you guys.
NEUT4|I have my lines and graphs already set.
NEUT5|Like always guys.
NEUT6|We start from a higher time frame because we want to be able to see the overall direction and picture that our stock is in.
NEUT7|If we don't do this and we start from a smaller time frame then will only be trading in a vacuum and basically trading blind you guys so we don't ever do that.
NEUT8|We start with my higher time frame and then break down to a smaller time frame to find our injuries.
NEUT9|So let's go ahead and dive in.
NEUT10|You guys.
NEUT11|So I'm going to start with our support line.
NEUT12|If we look to our left we have all these candle sticks that either reject or bounce off in this area we have this candle stick.
NEUT13|We can count this candle stick since it's in that general area of aware that support lines at and then you have these four in this area.
NEUT14|You have one on this side and then you have one on the opposite side, the opposite side down here working as resistance.
BEAR15|As we can see this came up hit our resistance an ultimately pulled back and failed.
BEAR16|And then when we came back and tested the same resistance, we gapped up, came back down and tested our support, bounced off this level came all the way up here and hit our resistance.
BEAR17|Are major resistance line.
BEAR18|This is what our this line represents is our major resistance and came back down.
BEAR19|Bounced off this level gaps.
BULL20|All we back up into resistance.
BEAR21|Ultimately tested again and failed to where we're basically at right now.
BEAR22|We are currently bouncing off this major support level.
BEAR23|The only problem that I don't like what I'm seeing right now is this red line is representing the down trend that we're currently in, so as of right now, we really haven't broke this trend guys.
NEUT24|So who am I to say that this is not going to just pull back and continue its trend that it's doing So what we need is we need further confirmation before getting into this tree, so that way we don't just jump into something that we have no clue what we're looking at.
NEUT25|So as of right now, like I said, there's no clear direction that we're in.
BULL26|Yes, we are bouncing off this support.
NEUT27|But all we're doing right now is just creating higher lows.
NEUT28|I'm starting a lower lows and lower highs is what we're creating, so we're going to want to see.
BULL29|Is this to actually come up break past this trend line and then come back down and rest on this new minor support for us to further confirm that this is creating and breaking a trend and that we're starting a new trend going up.
BEAR30|So as of right now, I would particularly wait on this doc for more clear direction that we're in, but as of right now, like I said, you guys, we are still in this downtrend.
NEUT31|Pre market were at 190, so we're kind of still in the same area as we were yesterday, so we'll see what happens.
NEUT32|You guys, if it does pull back down into this level, the 183.
BULL33|This could be a good buy opportunity from either a bounce from this level 'cause we look to our left.
BULL34|This is a major support line you guys.
BEAR35|So if it comes back and down an creates a double bottom retest.
NEUT36|Like I said, you could put your entry down here and then your stop loss.
NEUT37|Ultimately on the opposite side which would be down here in the 180.
NEUT38|And then like I said, your entry would be at around the 183.
NEUT39|Your first target would be the minor resistance that we had back up here at 191.
NEUT40|If you're a quart rate or swing trader would be a little bit higher.
NEUT41|Back up here and the 200 level.
