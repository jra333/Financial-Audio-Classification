NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Steve Miller and this will be a socially brief look at the stock market."
NEUT1|Short term, this is a chart that I want you to see.
NEUT2|That's a little unusual and I want you to notice that what is on the bottom is the disparity index.
NEUT3|This is a six month chart and we're going to look at.
NEUT4|Here is the distance from the center of the slim ribbon, which is the 13 day exponential moving average every time that the index moves very far away from it as measured by the disparity index.
NEUT5|And you can see in here it gets about 3% away from it.
BEAR6|On the downside it causes rallies when it's about 3% on the upside away from it, it brings pullbacks.
BULL7|As you can see, and right now we're coming up now at about close to 2.9%.
BULL8|That probably means in the next day or so, you're going to get a reversal, and at least a small pullback.
NEUT9|I thought that was really interesting and for short term traders you would find that very valuable to your trading.
NEUT10|Make sure that you go over.
