BEAR9|So before I go on with my analysis on AMC stock in my prediction I kind of went over some latest news on AMC stock that has kind of made it move a lot today within the last three days AMC stock has plummeted around 35%, but it has jumped back around 17%.
BULL10|So we're looking to make a good recovery for AMC stock.
NEUT11|So now I do kind of want to go over some information.
BULL12|AMC Stock has still more than quadrupled in 2021, which is great.
BULL13|Guys that is something that is going good for AMC.
BEAR14|AMC investors are having a lot of tough time due to volatility in the market with.
NEUT15|AMC in GameStop.
NEUT16|This is something that we do have to take in consideration.
NEUT17|As with the reasons of what a short squeeze is and how it actually happens, the short volume is still at 55.49 million shares.
BULL18|The previous short is 48.13, so we're up around 15.29% versus last month.
BULL19|The short interest ratio days to cover 0.4 which needs to go up a little bit.
NEUT20|The outstanding shares is 52 million shares.
NEUT21|Percentage of shares shorted is only around 12.33% and that is something we do have to take into consideration.
NEUT22|This is going to be something that is going to take a good while.
NEUT23|AMC is going to be reopening in New York and then California earlier this month.
NEUT24|They're wanting everything to be open and ready by tomorrow.
NEUT25|By this weekend rolls around.
BULL26|AMC should have 99% of its locations open again.
NEUT27|For.
NEUT28|With that being said, I kinda do want to go over the chart now, and if you guys have it yet, if you don't know what a short squeeze all that good stuff is.
NEUT29|I do have a previous video I recently made on AMC stock, so make sure you go check that out.
BULL30|AMC Stock recently has seen the biggest movement, definitely.
BEAR31|Within the last week we had seen it dropped from around the high of around 1450 all the way down to $8.88 today which we actually bounced off support twice.
BULL32|We actually hit a double bottom going up, and now we're starting to see big movement.
NEUT33|Are we going to consolidate for the rest of day on AMC stock and see big movement in the last few minutes of market or we're going to see it after hours?
NEUT34|There's something that we're going to have to take a look at and see there for.
NEUT35|Right now.
NEUT36|We do have a support at $9 ninety three cents, $9.33, an $8.88, which the double bottom happened at.
BULL37|Therefore, that resistance is 1248 and 1413, and once we do go past those marks, I think that we can easily test around $15 again on AMC Entertainment stock.
NEUT38|And I'm not a financial advisor is just for entertainment purposes only.
NEUT39|If you do like this type of content, make sure you leave me like, subscribe down below.
NEUT40|So now let's go over my process prediction on AMC Entertainment AMC stock is going to possibly see around the 15th to the $20 within the next month.
NEUT41|I do think possibilities sometime in April we were going to see big movement coming into AMC once.
NEUT42|Everything does start opening.
NEUT43|We start getting more and more people back to theaters as they were supposed to be.
NEUT44|Opening 99% tomorrow.
BULL45|So that is something that is going to be big for AMC and I think that we're seeing big movement.
NEUT46|Definitely tomorrow as it is a Friday too.
BEAR47|We usually see less volume on Thursday and Fridays, but today we're keeping up with a lot of the volume since that market has kind of corrected back from the downfall we had seen from yesterday and this week.
BULL48|Therefore, I think long term AMC stock could potentially hit around the 25 to $30 mark again once everything does normalize, everything gets back to normal for AMC.
