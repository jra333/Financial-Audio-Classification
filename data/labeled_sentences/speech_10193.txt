NEUT0|"""Brian, we spent a good amount of time talking in the morning here about certain speculative parts of this market."
NEUT1|You know, I reminisce a bit about the mid to late 90s.
BULL2|It was a fun time by the way.
NEUT3|Just curious as to whether you see it and how you see it and whether it's a risk.
NEUT4|It's a very, very speculative market right now, and it may be that description needs a few more varies.
NEUT5|It is most likely have I've seen, certainly since late 1999, early early 2000, and you know, if you remember back to that point in time, it wasn't like the market softly rolled over and you could kind of start to think about some of your more aggressive positions.
NEUT6|It just it just topped out one day and I, I think that's probably what's going to happen here.
NEUT7|So how do you position for that and what do you?
NEUT8|I mean, again, to your point.
NEUT9|I remember that.
NEUT10|As well, and there isn't one thing that I could point to or that was it.
NEUT11|You know, it's any number of different things you can look at in hindsight, but what are you focused on to sort of?
NEUT12|Try to determine how are you constructing your portfolio to make sure you're not hurt, if in fact you're correct.
NEUT13|Well, we're we're a relative value manager, so we're very unlikely to find ourselves in the speculative end of the swimming pool under any set of circumstances.
NEUT14|You know right now, if you look at what's working in the market, it's almost like a smile with really speculative stuff.
NEUT15|And what you call the hope trade so super deep value, very ultra contrarian type of stocks like Department stores and things those have been doing well.
NEUT16|We're not really in either of those places where we're more down the middle of the fairway, so you know.
BULL17|Quality businesses that you know can grow predictably, generate good cash flow.
NEUT18|You don't need to use your imagination with respect to the accounting and and you know that tends to be rewarded, just not really.
NEUT19|You know, flavor of the month right now.
NEUT20|What's the bond market telling us and how?
NEUT21|How closely, how seriously you're watching this move in, say, the 10 year yields right now.
NEUT22|I mean, are you in this camp that is debating the possibility of inflation and what that could potentially mean even before the year is out for Fed policy.
NEUT23|There's a.
NEUT24|There's a complicated answer to that question that could take forever to explain, but it yields matter.
NEUT25|OK, they definitely matter, and you know if you look at what happened in the year 2000, you know the Feds heightened up liquid iti after Y2K proved to be equipped nonevent.
NEUT26|That's what ultimately took the speculative market down.
NEUT27|So Y2K is not ever gonna really repeat itself again.
NEUT28|But what we do have is a reopening of the economy, and that's you know, it's contingent on.
BULL29|Find vaccines I saw yesterday that the administration raised guidance for 13 and a half million vaccines a week.
NEUT30|That sounds like 50 million a month and we're going to get J&J probably the beginning of March.
BULL31|That will probably take the numbers closer to 80 million a month.
NEUT32|Yeah, there's only about 270 million American adults, so you know if you if you kind of add that all together, that sounds like you could get pretty close to everybody vaccinated by early to mid day.
NEUT33|And at that point you know things are going to start looking a lot different.
NEUT34|We just have so much pent up demand pent up, supply pent up.
NEUT35|Illiquidity looking for things to do that seems like it could create some inflation I think with with the bar, that's what the bond market is sniffing out.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
