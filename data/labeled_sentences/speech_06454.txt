NEUT0|"""Financial news and data terminal is often being a shorthand for markets activity, but this is under pressure like never before."
NEUT1|Let's talk about it.
NEUT2|Is David great presence of financial risk at Thomson Reuters David welcome.
NEUT3|So what exactly is happening in your market now?
BULL4|Well, thanks for that.
BULL5|It's a really exciting time to be in the market.
NEUT6|We've seen for many years now, three big forces, kind of a perfect storm coming together, more regulation, economic challenges, new technology.
NEUT7|Bringing together a whole set of changes which we've been building around our platform.
NEUT8|Strategy for this kind of summarize it by 4 big things.
NEUT9|One is big electronification of the marketplace across trading, which we can see here.
NEUT10|From the change between these two charts, you see it very clearly.
NEUT11|That's a four year trend that will continue electronification of trading, not just the front office, but through middle and back office, but also electronification of analysis, investment strategies, portfolio management and the like connected to that too is the shift of risk, responsibility and trading from sell side by side by side firms are having to do a lot more work.
NEUT12|Cross asset class trading risk management, best execution and compliance.
NEUT13|That's a big shift as well, so that's changing the landscape is seeing an explosion of data here?
NEUT14|Well exactly.
NEUT15|I mean, I remember on the Brexit day we distributed 30 billion data updates in 24 hours.
NEUT16|It was extreme day, but that's the kind of volumes were doing.
NEUT17|It was running at 10 million peak, but petabyte of data a day is what we're collecting a massive creation and demand for data going around the world as a result of this, which really is kind of an opportunity in a problem for many customers in the market.
NEUT18|How do I get hold of this manager?
NEUT19|Make sure it's secure, safe?
NEUT20|And use it in the right way is becoming a real differentiator of how they operate, and this is this is all going to to humans or how much are these machines now?
BULL21|Well, we crossed an interesting Rubik on June 15 where we found that we've got more customers who are machines and humans.
NEUT22|We've got more revenue coming from machine side than than humans.
NEUT23|Doesn't mean the terminal on the desktop is not important, but it clearly is a sign of things to come.
NEUT24|I asked the team or how do we manage customer loyalty when our customer is machine.
NEUT25|Well of course you have to.
NEUT26|Nurture, develop the developer community, the technologists and deliver APIs and open capabilities like we have done on the platform that helps them to do that.
NEUT27|So what's the terminal of the future?
NEUT28|If you like going to be, is it going to be a terminal?
NEUT29|What you know to me?
BULL30|I think you've seen convergence.
NEUT31|You're seeing a terminal if you like that traditionally was quite close, quite locked, has to be much more open now has to have third party data in it.
NEUT32|Your data has to connect to other applications.
BULL33|We've got customers who are now building inside the terminal to incorporate their workflow, and I think you're seeing a convergence between.
NEUT34|The data world.
NEUT35|The APIs in the technology and the terminal world like a human augmented by machines, is that there's the model that we see going forward in the acid test.
NEUT36|Well, that will actually mean cheaper data well.
NEUT37|There's a lot more data.
NEUT38|It would seem like it's cheaper to send it around the world.
BULL39|Technology costs are decreasing, but the opposite effect is.
NEUT40|This is kind of balkanization of data privacy, data security, cyber.
NEUT41|I think one thing we're trying to do is make sure that we get the scale of data delivery right?
NEUT42|We've got 9000 partners on the PATH platform and to get to the customer you know the customers got firewalls.
NEUT43|They got security.
BULL44|They got compliance.
NEUT45|We're trying to lower the cost of that by doing it once.
NEUT46|Doing it at scale and providing the analytics and capabilities that they need.
NEUT47|To get hold of that data in the ecosystem so those two opposing forces are working in that way.
NEUT48|For our customers, they're spending on data, but they want better analytics.
NEUT49|They recognize that that's the secret to a better investment strategy.
BULL50|We're hoping to help them lower the cost of that access and that capability with all the data sources that are out there.
BULL51|David thank you very much.
BULL52|"Thank you."""
