BEAR0|"""Will we see Disney revenues and earnings falling short of analysts expectations?"
BULL1|Earnings coming in at a dollar and 35 adjusted versus estimates of a dollar and 75.
NEUT2|There are a couple of interesting items in here, many of them from the integration with Fox that seem to be behind that miss an EPS revenues.
BEAR3|Also missing estimates coming at 20.25 billion versus estimates of 21.47 billion.
NEUT4|Bob Eiger in his statement here, is saying that the results reflect the efforts to effectively integrate the 21st Century Fox.
NEUT5|Assets and looking at what is behind those lower than expected numbers.
BEAR6|Studio Entertainment operating income coming in lower than expected at 792,000,000, versus the 1 billion expected, and that is because of Dark Phoenix.
NEUT7|This is the 21st Century Fox film.
BEAR8|The company here is saying that it recorded a film cost impairment because of Dark Phoenix, which was a big disappointment at the box office.
NEUT9|Another factor here weighing on these results.
BEAR10|The company says the direct to consumer and international division that division showing lower a sorry excuse me a larger loss than expected operating income loss of 553 million in the quarter.
BEAR11|The company is saying that the increase in operating loss at the Director Consumer in International Vision was due to the consolidation of Hulu.
BULL12|The ramp up of investment in ESPN Plus, which was launched in April 2018.
BEAR13|An costs associated with the upcoming launch of Disney Plus.
BEAR14|We see Disney shares are now down nearly 5% in after hours trading.
NEUT15|Just to go into some of these other divisions here, Parks and resorts.
BULL16|The revenues increased 7% in the quarter at parks and Resorts, right in line with expectations.
BEAR17|But operating income for parks and resorts also lower than expected guys back over to you.
BULL18|Julia, thanks very much for that.
BEAR19|The shares sliding quite significantly down 4.5%.
NEUT20|Mike Media networks.
NEUT21|Media networks, the significant miss and also of course studio and entertainment parks, solid and direct to consumer.
NEUT22|A little ahead, but this is a surprise EPS bit of a surprise.
BEAR23|It seems like a little bit of a clean up quarter with a lot of these items as Julie was saying in the studio you take an impairment charge from an acquired film and it does seem first of all.
BEAR24|Again, we always have to remind Disney doesn't give guidance, so sometimes there's a little bit of play, but it's without a doubt a disappointment.
NEUT25|I think that.
BULL26|Investors had gotten first of all, very focused on the long term story, believing that the strategy is right in terms of direct to consumer and also that the studio was just incredibly reliable.
NEUT27|So I do think you had a little bit of that premium in there for the stability that got a little, you know, defined by these numbers, but just a little bit of that premium being taken out of the way, I would interpret the first.
NEUT28|The first trade here, Paul Hickey.
NEUT29|Your first take on on Disney.
BEAR30|Well, we sent out a report to clients this afternoon saying the August quarter is historically the weakest quarter in terms of stock price reaction.
NEUT31|10 out of the last 11 August.
BEAR32|Quarterly reports the stock is gapped down following report.
NEUT33|This will make it 11 out of 12, but I think for the longer term I wouldn't worry too much about it.
NEUT34|Disney's story with Disney is the streaming service launching later on.
NEUT35|So I mean investors who are bullish on the name could use this as a buying opportunity.
BULL36|The stocks done great over the last several years, but.
BEAR37|"August Quarter has historically been a just the worst quarter as far as the stock performance in reaction to those earnings reports."""
