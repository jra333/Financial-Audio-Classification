NEUT0|"""You have 13 characters characteristics that you say can be predict if you say if one if six of those go in One Direction that is determinative."
NEUT1|It basically is based on whether the incumbent party will hold office.
NEUT2|Let's go down the ones that you say truly basically suggested Mr. Trump will win.
NEUT3|Beginning with one is the party mandate and how well the parties did in the midterms.
BEAR4|The Democrats got crushed here.
BEAR5|That's a bad signal, correct?
NEUT6|That's a false member.
NEUT7|6 false is in your out.
NEUT8|And remember, this is a scientific prediction.
NEUT9|It's not an endorsement, right?
NEUT10|And is based on history.
NEUT11|I mean, you came up with this methodology.
NEUT12|Key #2 is the sitting president is not running.
NEUT13|If the sitting president is running, that tilts in the favor of the incumbent, right, right?
NEUT14|So that's the second false member.
NEUT15|6 false is in your out key number.
NEUT16|No smashing foreign policy success that's in there, right?
NEUT17|That's in there.
NEUT18|That's three down.
NEUT19|Three now Hillary Clinton is no Franklin Roosevelt.
NEUT20|That means that she does not have high charisma, right?
NEUT21|Four down 4 down five would be no major form of lacks charisma.
NEUT22|No big change in Obama's second term.
NEUT23|In other words, big policy things that they can point to write, correct?
NEUT24|Like Obamacare in the first term.
NEUT25|That's five an alright, so that's fine looking for one more.
NEUT26|If you're a Trump supporter.
NEUT27|And here it is, yeah, and that is.
NEUT28|The presence of a third party candidate who is going to pull high and presumably take votes away from the incumbent, right?
BEAR29|That's right, and you know, bedevil the incumbent because there are a lot of people who don't like Trump, and they might otherwise vote for Hillary Clinton.
NEUT30|But a third party provides a cushion, and the rule is, if you anticipate the third party to get at least 5%, that key is false, and that would be the six case you backtested this.
NEUT31|How many times has it proven correct?
NEUT32|How many?
NEUT33|How far back have you gone?
NEUT34|Correctly predicting every election since 84 an retrospectively the system is based on every election since 1860.
NEUT35|But let me stress this is an historical system.
NEUT36|I'm not Jean Dixon looking in a psychic, you know in a crystal, but those who remember Jean Dixon right?
NEUT37|Yeah, Jean Dixon, the psychic.
NEUT38|I'm not and as I say in my Washington Post article, there's a kicker here.
NEUT39|Donald Trump is such an outline candidate.
NEUT40|We've never seen a candidate.
BEAR41|Remotely like Donald Trump, and there is a reasonable chance that Donald Trump is such an outlier that he will smash the patterns of history and ****** defeat from the jaws of victory.
NEUT42|A generic Republican is predicted, but Donald Trump with all the things you have said has said all the groups he is offended his embrace of a Russian dictator.
NEUT43|Anything but generic for meddling in the election could change everything.
