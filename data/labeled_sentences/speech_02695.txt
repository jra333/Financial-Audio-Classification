NEUT0|"""Yeah, I can't remember a time when we were, I'll just use the word being threatened with a correction."
NEUT1|When the fundamentals of the economy.
NEUT2|We're so strong and I think if we went poking around we could.
NEUT3|Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure we don't keep track your corrections the way we do big dives.
NEUT4|Yeah, yeah, that's true.
NEUT5|But I'm saying.
NEUT6|I mean, it's it's not now.

NEUT23|"All day, it's not the time to get out and I think we're going to see a very strong market for the next market as a result of the economy for the change as opposed to as a result of central banks and the Fed that I think it's going to be more of a result of the underlying fundamentals of the economy getting stronger."""
