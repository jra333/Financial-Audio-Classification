BULL1|Thanks for tuning in today.
NEUT2|I want to talk about a stock Walt Disney on the car pump today after some major announcement I want to keep an eye on Walt Disney's technical looking strong.
BULL3|Currently trading at 175 or up 13% in the past 24 hours for an OG stock like Walt Disney, it's something to pay attention to.
NEUT4|If you didn't catch wind.
BULL5|I'm actually excited about the announcement that they did.
NEUT6|You can see here on CNN fake news saying Earth shaking development in the streaming wars, and I'll tell you this much Disney is going for.
NEUT7|Netflix is neck, so Netflix better protect their neck.
NEUT8|Hashtag wu-tang.
NEUT9|I'm excited about some of these shows that they're talking about Obi Wan Shi whole Pinocchio Disney unveiled a blitz of new Star Wars projects, including ten television shows.
NEUT10|That will be Mandalorian spinoffs, well following C3 PEO and R2D2.
NEUT11|Rogue Squadron and one that I'm extremely excited about is.
NEUT12|The one with Darth Vader, it's going to be called Obi One Kenobi Hayden Christensen returns as Vader, and it's going to be set after he becomes Vader's like.
NEUT13|I guess you know the rise of Darth Vader, which I'm, you know, Vader, one of the one of the illest villains out there, kaboom.
NEUT14|So that's what's going on.
NEUT15|Let's talk about the mathematics here and Disney Investor Day.
NEUT16|You can see on Thursday the company announced that Disney service now has 86 million subscribers.
BULL17|The company said it expects between 2:30 and 260 million subscribers in 2021, so they're going at Netflix is next and at the bottom line is the stock is going up and Disney plans to increase the cost of services from 799 up $1.00.
NEUT18|So it's going to be 99.
BULL19|Still cheaper than Netflix is my understanding.
NEUT20|OK so I wanted to keep an eye on this not only because of, you know, I like to follow a media, but you know as it relates to the finances and the kaboom.
NEUT21|So keep an eye on Disney.
NEUT22|The OG is the biggest media company I believe in the world.
NEUT23|OK and.
NEUT24|Will continue to look at all media companies in crypto as well.
NEUT25|Everything from D Live the Theta and more.
NEUT26|OK, there's definitely developments.
NEUT27|I wouldn't sleep on media.
NEUT28|You know, if you haven't figured out how strong media is, just figure out how everybody became a super villain overnight wearing masks.
NEUT29|It's due to the media.
NEUT30|So anyhow, do the research.
NEUT31|Do the knowledge.
NEUT32|Let me know you want to do short video there about Walt Disney and the component 174.
NEUT33|You know, do I hold this stock?
NEUT34|No, but you know it's been on my watch list has been here on my my watch this for a while and it's definitely something.
NEUT35|Consider and drop a comment.
NEUT36|Let me know.
NEUT37|I you know I don't use Netflix because the shows on there are not satisfying to me.
NEUT38|I do have Walt Disney.
NEUT39|I have the Disney Plus because of the family or what not.
BULL40|It seems like they have better content now.
NEUT41|Drop a comment.
NEUT42|Let me know and again, this is not whether you know one is better than the other.
