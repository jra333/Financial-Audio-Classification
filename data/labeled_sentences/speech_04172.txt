NEUT0|"""It's going to be a video chart on ticker symbol INUV."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, a very eventful day on this one.
NEUT4|Although I will say that from a presentation standpoint a relatively tricky chart to talk about 'cause there's a whole lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT5|What do I mean by that?
NEUT6|Well, if you're some sort of daytrader flipper scalp or would want to kill yourself and you bought right there, you bought right there in your plan was to buy and sell off in 15 minutes.
BEAR7|Well, then from that perspective the chart looks really, really bad.
BULL8|Now if you care about things from the bigger picture, I understand from these highs there has been our larger pullback, but from the grand scheme of it all the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT9|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT10|Just higher base is being put into play.
NEUT11|Over extended periods of time, and that's where the viewpoint that I'm talking about things from.
NEUT12|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a charter type mentality going into all this, and I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but.
NEUT13|For explanations like, let's say the price comes down here to right around here at $1.32.
NEUT14|So price comes down here to Dollar thirty two behave in that manner then starts to curl back upwards.
NEUT15|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT16|What would you have while you have a set of those there, you'd have Lowe's.
NEUT17|There you have those there.
NEUT18|You'd have those down there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT19|Well, from the big picture, you'd still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT20|And again, that's the name of the game.
BULL21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And again in this situation.
BULL23|That dollar 32 mark representing the area of progress once again I fully get it.
NEUT24|If you're a day trader and you bought up there, you don't care about these three steps.
NEUT25|That's why I try to offer a warning that I would be commenting on things from the bigger picture point of view.
BULL26|So yeah, today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here, you can see the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT27|So let's see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT30|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR34|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT40|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT41|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT42|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
