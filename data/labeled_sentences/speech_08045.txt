NEUT0|"""History says now isn't the time to fret, especially for investors who don't need their money for at least a few years or more."
NEUT1|This article represents the opinion of the writer who may disagree with the official recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service.
NEUT2|Where Motley questioning and investing thesis, even one of our own, helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier and richer.
NEUT3|Follow at Ann Ross Alilo almost a year from the start of the pandemic.
BULL4|The stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is up 18% at all time.
BEAR5|Highs with the pandemic still going on a crash must be imminent.
NEUT6|Bright, probably not.
NEUT7|We're due for a bout of volatility, but the market's behavior in the last year isn't without historical precedent.
NEUT8|Make some adjustments based on your goals if they've changed, but the average investor should just keep their heads down.
NEUT9|Keep on investing and enjoy the next economic expansion for the next few years.
NEUT10|What's a crash anyway?
BEAR11|A stock market crash is loosely defined as a double digit percentage decline in stock prices over the course of a few days.
BEAR12|Market corrections which can take longer, are actually quite common since the early 1900s, the S&P 500 has tended to fall.
BULL13|5% from recent highs a few times a year and notch is a steeper 10% or more.
NEUT14|Plunge about once every year to year and a half.
NEUT15|These events are usually temporary and reverse course again quickly.
BEAR16|But when many investors think about a crash, they're thinking about a bigger drop of 20% or more, or even a bear market in which stocks fall and stay down for a prolonged period of time.
BEAR17|These 20% declines are more rare about every seven years or so on average.
BEAR18|Normally a market crash and ensuing bear market corresponds with the start of an economic recession like the one that happened last spring at the beginning of the pandemic.
NEUT19|Therefore, historically speaking, the crash many investors are looking for arguably already happened.
NEUT20|Long story short, while history does rhyme, it's a mistake to expect what just happened in the recent past to repeat itself over and over again.
NEUT21|A big market crash like what happened in early 2020 isn't a given just because the market has advanced since then.

NEUT24|This market rally is totally normal, but is it really normal for the stock market to rally like it has in the last year, especially given the real pain that's going on out there?
BEAR25|Many small businesses and households, even some bigger businesses in brick and mortar, retail, travel and dining have been deeply affected by COVID-19.
NEUT26|However, a stock market rally even in the midst of an on going crisis, is actually normal.
NEUT27|Take the last big crash in 2008, 2009 during the Great Recession.
BULL28|After plunging one last time in March 2009, after a terrible 2008 in which the market fell 37%, the S&P 500 preceded to rebound and finish the year up 26%.
