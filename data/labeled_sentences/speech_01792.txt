NEUT0|"""What's Facebook worth to you will take a look."
NEUT1|Everybody on this program knows what Facebook is.
NEUT2|Facebook is the social media giant.
NEUT3|Its market cap is $378 billion.
BULL4|It's a success.
BULL5|The stock is a success as well.
NEUT6|Let's take a look at the chart over here.
NEUT7|You can see it trades at about $122 a share.
NEUT8|It went public 2012 2013 between 25 and $30 a share.
BULL9|So that's been a big success.
NEUT10|Not only can you.
NEUT11|Send pictures and notes to your friends, but you've made a lot of money.
NEUT12|If you've owned the stock since it went public 4-5 years ago, all that is positive.
NEUT13|Now the question is $122 a share?
NEUT14|Is it something that you want to own yourself in your stock portfolio?
NEUT15|While would you want to own Facebook?
NEUT16|Facebook is a giant advertising company.
NEUT17|Yes, you think it's a way to send messages to your friends or photographs to your parents or whatever.
NEUT18|The reality is.
BULL19|Facebook sells add time and it sells it very successfully.
NEUT20|Can it sell more?
NEUT21|I think it's sell a lot more.
NEUT22|It's only at the beginning.
NEUT23|Take WhatsApp one of the products owned by Facebook.
NEUT24|It's free, nobody pays for WhatsApp.
NEUT25|Yet millions of people use it everyday.
BULL26|Very successful, simple platform that can adapt itself in many, many ways.
NEUT27|So Facebook has all the ingredients for long term success.
NEUT28|And I'm talking 20 years success.
NEUT29|But fads change ten years ago, 12 years ago, Facebook didn't exist.
NEUT30|It only came around in 2004.
NEUT31|So in 12 years will be people posting their pictures to Facebook and selling selling ads and whatever through their messages.
NEUT32|Maybe not.
NEUT33|That's a risk.
NEUT34|The other risk with Facebook is you're paying a huge premium to get a company growing at as fast as Facebook has been growing.
NEUT35|You're getting on a roller coaster.
NEUT36|The roller coaster is going up and it's going down.
BULL37|Mostly it's gone up, will it?
BULL38|Will it continue to go up?
BULL39|I think the chances are pretty good that Facebook is a good company.
BULL40|It has decent management.
NEUT41|I don't know the management.
BULL42|Personally, but I look at the success records said yes, this is a company that's taken advantage.
BULL43|Unlike say Yahoo and even some of the Google products haven't been at all was a great success.
NEUT44|So Facebook has its network.
NEUT45|It has you the consumer to drive its products.
NEUT46|They then sell ads on the back of your pleasure at facebooking your friends.
NEUT47|All that's positive.
NEUT48|The question is at $122 a share is it something you want to dive into in an uncertain market.
NEUT49|I would say no.
NEUT50|I think it's a little expensive.
NEUT51|Is $110 better as $100?
BULL52|Yes, they're better prices.
BULL53|Will Facebook tend to go up over the next 10 years?
NEUT54|I would hope so.
NEUT55|I would think you as the consumer of Facebook and the watcher of this program, might have a better insight into whether Facebook, as a product will have staying power.
NEUT56|If you feel it does not.
NEUT57|That Facebook is a trend that people are going to be moving on from the Facebook world.
NEUT58|Then you've got a.
NEUT59|You've got to say, wait a minute, I'm not paying over 20 times earnings to buy a company at the nearly at the peak of its performance.
NEUT60|In terms of the stock market, and then hope it goes to two 4250.
NEUT61|Whatever it is that you're looking for is an appreciation.
