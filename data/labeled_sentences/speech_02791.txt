BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is a turn off every 2021.
NEUT2|Wednesday, the day after we were #18 EOS whitiker EOS.
BEAR3|So for US against BTC is not looking good.
BEAR4|We continue dropping down the following channel down and down and down we go.
NEUT5|How much lower are we going to go?
NEUT6|I don't know there still just still no clear reversal Titans coming on for US against BTC excuse me as long as we are under the skinny pink line.
NEUT7|Excuse me, we remain bias bearish for E OS against BC until we start seeing bullishness until we start seeing signs of life until we break the resistance break.
NEUT8|The skinny pink line together with the resistance then only we switch our bias to bullish.
BEAR9|So at this point of time things are still looking pretty bleak.
NEUT10|For US against BTC no life coming in for US, yet so very, very careful about going to a trade to assume things are just not turning bullish.
NEUT11|Yet for iOS, maybe one fine day but not at this point of time.
NEUT12|And we have to break resistance, right?
BULL13|I think even if you do break resistance, we need to go on an accumulation adventure.
BULL14|Which means that if we were to break it, we will still need to go for a very long drawn out accumulation before you CEO S rise higher.
NEUT15|So it is still a long way to go before you see US continues on its merry way towards the upside.
NEUT16|So be careful about going to a trade too.
NEUT17|So alright, let's move on to US against USD.
NEUT18|But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about US in the comments below.
NEUT19|So what US against USD?
NEUT20|I think we're in accumulation.
BULL21|I think we're in consolidation.
NEUT22|Think more likely than not.
NEUT23|So once we're done squeezing right, we're squeezing lemons at this point of time.
NEUT24|Lower, high, lower, high, High, low, high, low.
BEAR25|So there is compression coming on for US against USD.
BULL26|This is good, something we'd like to see.
NEUT27|However, I don't think it's going to be so simple as input and the next moment.
NEUT28|We start blasting off.
NEUT29|Look at this.
BEAR30|We've been compressing for a certain amount of time.
NEUT31|I would also expect us to be compressing for a certain amount of time.
NEUT32|This might take us towards mid year year of 2021 before you see any sort of bullishness coming for US against USD, right?
NEUT33|So if we were to start blasting off for US, it's going to take several more months.
NEUT34|Of course, I could be wrong.
NEUT35|Of course, the next second we could just see a move coming for US, but at least one of them if anything.
NEUT36|If the US wheels wanted to make a move.
NEUT37|Upside down will have to build a solid base first and so solid base building takes months.
NEUT38|It doesn't take days or weeks, it takes months before you see a move coming for the OS.
NEUT39|So be very careful about going to trade too soon.
NEUT40|They could still be a little bit more accumulation first before you see a move coming for the OS, so there we go.
NEUT41|Those are my thoughts for OS.
NEUT42|So stay safe and don't do anything.
NEUT43|I wouldn't do thank you very much for watching.
BULL44|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT45|"I shall see you in the next video."""
