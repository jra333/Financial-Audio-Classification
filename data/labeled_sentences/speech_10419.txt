NEUT0|"""And Jim, of course, I don't know where you want to start this morning."
NEUT1|You know?
NEUT2|I mean, we should point out when we talk over there is good news, which is the case.
BEAR3|Counts are way down, hospitalizations are down, deaths lagging unfortunately, and continue to be quite high.
NEUT4|But there was a lot of concern about new variants.
BULL5|At the same time, vaccinations are picking up pace.
BULL6|Look, I am very positive in a lot of my information comes from Doctor Gottlieb who's been very good about the rollout.
NEUT7|He didn't use the word glut, but he did say that we're going to be hard pressed to find more people beyond 100,000,000.
NEUT8|Literally, in April it have already taken it, and I think that what he's saying is a Clarion call.
NEUT9|We better find a new way other than the algos that we talked about today in the Wall Street Journal to get those vaccines.
NEUT10|Two people.
NEUT11|Once we have so many of them.
NEUT12|So David look, I know we can say that that's going to be with us for a long time, but I think my flu shot every year.
NEUT13|I keep thinking, why haven't they wiped out flu?
NEUT14|But they haven't.
BEAR15|I think it's going to be a form of flu from the very beginning.
NEUT16|David, A literally a year ago.
NEUT17|You said that when we have therapeutics when we have a miss when we have something we can take care of ourselves.
NEUT18|Then this will become an illness, not a fatality, at something that's killing millions of people.
BEAR19|David, I think we're getting closer and closer to that, but we keep losing size.
NEUT20|You know I on the prize we keep talking about a vaccine we need to talk about therapeutics.
NEUT21|No, you're right.
NEUT22|It's you know, it's funny because there was a there was a period of which, as you know, I thought an many others, perhaps believed as well.
BULL23|You see the therapeutics prior to seeing the vaccines, but in fact the vaccine moved, moved along at rapid speed, and we're thankful for that.
NEUT24|But those therapeutics will be there eventually.
NEUT25|Jim.
NEUT26|And to your point.
NEUT27|As this stays in the background as this mutates to some extent, those actually may end up still being a very important line of defense, something that you can take if in fact you get it if there is adequate testing around as well, which we all hope will be the case that will just immediately stop the symptoms and or the progression of any disease, and so that will be really important and that will allow us to be back to normal as well.
NEUT28|Even when we do get closer to herd immunity.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
