BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about Grubhub.
NEUT2|So Grubhub does fast food delivery.
NEUT3|Their competitor to waiter or door Dash or Uber eats or probably some others?
NEUT4|I don't even know.
NEUT5|Current present $77.00 which gives the market cap of $1.2 billion.
NEUT6|So obviously still a fairly small company.
NEUT7|Dividend zero.
NEUT8|I don't expect that to change in the next decade or so.
BEAR9|Revenue $1.3 billion up 30% earnings negative $19 million down from the earnings of $78 million.
BEAR10|So obviously not great at this point.
NEUT11|And they have current P of 67 with a forward PE of sorry they have a current P of negative 67.
BEAR12|Sorry, that wasn't clear with the forward PE of 385, which is you know slightly high.
NEUT13|It's Netflix Ish territory total assets $2.4 billion total liabilities $881 million, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $1.5 billion.
NEUT14|And that is kind of the balance sheet that I like to see with assets to liabilities.
NEUT15|Ratio of like three.
BULL16|That is pretty nice.
BEAR17|Obviously, stockholders equity is still pretty low, but it's more than the market cap, which is kind of weird.
NEUT18|You know you would think it's worth buying this stock if the stockholders equity is higher than the market cap, but you know anyway?
BULL19|So for a growth investor, we actually have decent growth here.
BEAR20|For once revenue growth of 30% is not bad earnings of negative 17.
BEAR21|Negative $19 million at a market cap of 1.2 billion?
NEUT22|I don't think is bad.
BULL23|I don't really think that it's significant in the long run, so it's almost balanced and last year they had a.
BULL24|They had earnings of 78 million and the forward P is positive as well, so.
BULL25|Obviously pretty close to being profitable and I don't really mind the negative earnings this year since they're pretty insignificant, so I think that for growth investors this might actually be a decent stock to look at, because revenue growth nice earnings almost positive, which is not something that you get with a whole lot of growth stocks at this point either.
BULL26|And the balance sheet is pretty nice as well, so I think that this is actually a growth stock that I would be willing to buy for dividend investor.
NEUT27|Obviously there's nothing here at all, and for a value investor, the balance sheet looks nice.
BEAR28|The revenue growth is good, there's no dividend, and the P is currently negative, and the forward PE of 385 is also not great for a value investor.
NEUT29|So overall I would assume that most value investors would stay away from a stock like this, and kind of let it stabilize.
NEUT30|For awhile before investing, so I think that only growth investors might be interested in this talk, but for that I think it's actually a really nice stock.
NEUT31|That's it for me.
