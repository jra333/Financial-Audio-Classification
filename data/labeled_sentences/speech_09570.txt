NEUT0|"""Why is it, say, Avengers weekend?"
NEUT1|Let's take a look at what's going on over the weekend and seeing what's happening with Disney tomorrow.
NEUT2|Right, so this is the daily chart on Disney.
NEUT3|As you can see, it's pretty sideways and then all of a sudden you got this big bump up, and that's all because of what's happening with the past few days regarding what's happening later with Disney.
NEUT4|In terms of the Disney service that they're providing as well as The Avengers movie that just came out.
NEUT5|End game.
NEUT6|If you look at this, this is where we ended up on Friday.
BEAR7|Most likely a gap up Monday morning.
NEUT8|Just keep an eye on this or we're looking at a little bit of upside.
BULL9|And if you look at the Woodies CCI, we've been on the positive and it's it's the actual CCI is on its way up again.
NEUT10|So there was some rejection that we got trending patterns going on over here.
BULL11|We got the RSI trending upwards.
BULL12|We got the Mac D. Still with the distance trending upwards as well.
BULL13|So there's some room to grow over here, so if you're looking for a short term play, possibly in at least the next few days, and we're looking at a little bit of an up target right around around here, I would anticipate just because of the news with the movie that just came out, shattering box office records in yet another few dollars.
NEUT14|If you want to get in, but this may be a good opportunity.
BULL15|Again, good short term play, I think for the rest of the year, or maybe even.
NEUT16|A good long term play if you're looking at a long term solution because they're coming out with a couple of more movies, we're looking at The Lion King you're looking at Frozen 2.
NEUT17|We got another Star Wars movie coming out so they they got a lot of stuff going on that's happening for most part of this year, so I suggest if you looking at something of a short play as well as something in a long term horizon, this may be a pretty decent stock to look at.
NEUT18|And in your portfolio.
