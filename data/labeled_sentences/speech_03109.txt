NEUT0|"""So everybody be doing analysis video on Facebook ticker symbol, FB."
NEUT1|So on the chart here I have drawn 200A moving average along with a couple of recent support levels.
NEUT2|So before we dive into the charts, I do just want to say a couple of things about the stock.
NEUT3|You know, it's essentially done, almost nothing for the better.
NEUT4|Of six months.
NEUT5|You know when it reached that $305.00 all time high.
NEUT6|And even before that, you know when you got covid levels, you know, right around here you know, dip down to 137 broke back up to around this.
NEUT7|You know 225 level and trade it in that range from 2:25 to 2:45.
NEUT8|For you know a couple months too.
BEAR9|So you know the reason behind a lot of that is, it seems like every other week you got a new negative headline on Facebook.
NEUT10|First it was all the section 230.
NEUT11|Negativity and then you had you know the issues with Apple and privacy.
NEUT12|And then you had the issues with the capital Riot and then now you have the issues with you know the news content with Australia and possibly other countries.
NEUT13|So you know the stock has had a hard time lately, but I do think that we're starting to enter a period where you know it's either going to go one or two ways and I'll show you that on the chart.
NEUT14|So.
NEUT15|You know?
NEUT16|Right here around this 245 level you know it's hit this level quite a few times, you know and.
BEAR17|It is trying to break out a few times.
NEUT18|You know, right around the end of the year 2020.
BEAR19|I started declining down and finally touched down to that 200 day moving average close below it for one day.
NEUT20|Broke back above it.
BULL21|You know, and just skyrocketed all the way back up to that, you know, 285 resistance level.
NEUT22|Test the 200 day moving average again.
BEAR23|And we've had a couple lower highs since then.
NEUT24|You know?
NEUT25|So if you look at the pattern, it does look like you know, it's starting to ascend down and wedge down into this 200 day moving average.
BEAR26|So you know if it does close, close below this 200 day moving average.
NEUT27|Which it possibly may, you know there's a couple options of what where the price might go.
NEUT28|You know one is, you know it.
NEUT29|Test is 200.
NEUT30|A moving average.
NEUT31|Again, you know.
NEUT32|Test it like I did the other day.
NEUT33|An touches, it goes back up and finally breaks out of this wedge right here.
NEUT34|The second is, you know, it may come down to this 245 level.
NEUT35|You know past the 200 day and get it bounced there.
NEUT36|You know the third option is that if it does break below this 245.
NEUT37|Support.
NEUT38|The next level is all the way down here at about 2:25, so that's something to watch out for, but I do think that investors are starting to look at Facebook now and say, alright, you know, this company is essentially done nothing.
NEUT39|You know the fundamentals are incredible.
BULL40|Their earnings are incredible.
BULL41|So I do think you know we're finally possibly in this.
NEUT42|Where we're going to see something happen.
NEUT43|At least you know whether it's breaking down through this 245 back down to the 2:25, you know.
NEUT44|And who knows what happens from there.
BEAR45|But it also could break out here.
NEUT46|And if it does, you know I do think you know it's just one more piece of good news from Facebook.
NEUT47|Whether it's something on streaming content or crypto, or you know some new products in the VR business, anything.
BEAR48|Or even some of the you know, tailwinds of some of the regulations an negative headlines if they can get some of that behind them.
BULL49|"I do think it's an, you know it will get to 300 pretty quickly, but you know just a couple of things to watch out for."""
