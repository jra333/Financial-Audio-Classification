NEUT0|"""A look at what's happening here across the markets."
BULL1|His comments coming out of the G20 summit have stirred things up.
BEAR2|As you can see here, there has been a market break right here, diving down as really right now.
BEAR3|The S&P was in a dip and the NASDAQ was getting crushed.
NEUT4|As of right now now.
BEAR5|This is prompted an absence of buyers and you can see here Facebook getting hammered as well.
NEUT6|Anna Bunch of different companies.
NEUT7|Falling.
NEUT8|Victim, I guess to what is being said here now.
NEUT9|This is what just happened.
NEUT10|They're saying that the G20 is talking about a digital tax and that this will impact Google, Amazon and others.
BEAR11|Now this digital taxation would impact all these companies.
BEAR12|And the companies obviously do not like this as one would imagine the US strongly opposes any measures specifically targeting digital companies or impeding their growth.
NEUT13|So this is interesting.
NEUT14|And then we talk about the taxes owed in the UK by Amazon and other entities that are gargantuas.
NEUT15|You have to ask the question, how come they haven't been subpoenaed or extradited in all this other crap well?
NEUT16|It comes down to that.
NEUT17|Money thing you see.
NEUT18|And in this instance.
NEUT19|This digital tax could affect things big time, and it already is here in terms of the markets Facebook filling Wrath.
NEUT20|Many other social media platforms filling the wrath, but we'll still have to see how this shakes out.
NEUT21|This is just some of the initial talk here of the digital tax.
NEUT22|Where everything is going to go yet to be seen.
NEUT23|There was a lot of.
BEAR24|Talk about the cryptocurrency markets as well ahead of this and heading downhill and then people thought a lot of doom and gloom was going to come out of there.
NEUT25|When actually it looks like the opposite happened.
NEUT26|And then we had Trump come out making statements about Venezuela and the executive order there things are.
NEUT27|Starting to take shape in terms of that here on this world stage and where things are going.
NEUT28|But this digital tax, it will be interesting to see.
NEUT29|How things?
NEUT30|End up here with this talk and we've got another day we have tomorrow.
NEUT31|A bunch of meetings that go down in Buenos Aires in terms of this G20 summit meeting as well.
NEUT32|So as I get more information.
NEUT33|And sure, as it pours out, we're going to see a reflection of things in the markets like we are now.
NEUT34|So I will continue to update as things evolve and happen.
NEUT35|Until next time this is Ben Daboo 7.
NEUT36|Make sure to bookmark underground worldnews.com going to be dropping some exclusives over there that you're not going to want to miss.
NEUT37|"Peace."""
