NEUT0|"""You once we went to the conversation where you talked about the influence of Mr. Flexner?"
NEUT1|You're on your family.
NEUT2|Maybe who here knows who Abraham Flexner is?
NEUT3|Steve Forbes and Jay Walker has two out of 201%.
NEUT4|Yeah 199%, you know.
NEUT5|And when he died the New York Times ran an editorial top, editorials that final paragraph said words to the effect that he may have been the individual that had the most influence on this country of anyone in the century.
NEUT6|Abfraction are.
NEUT7|It did not look like he was destined for greatness originally, but but Carnegie.
NEUT8|Pull him out in about 1912 or thereabouts to do the study of medical education in the country, and he produced the Carnegie report, which changed medical education.
NEUT9|United States result in about half of the medical schools being closed and had no background for it, particularly his older brother was a was a doctor and he had an interest in this subject, but he just had an ability to think straight.
NEUT10|So after that who came to him?
NEUT11|Rockefeller came to him.
NEUT12|Julius Rosenwald came to him.
NEUT13|When you nobody raised their hand, it was interesting 'cause the the Bamberger's, for example Louis Bamberger and his sister.
NEUT14|I don't think they had any children, and they came to flexor.
NEUT15|Now by this time is in the 1930s and they said, look at, we made our money in New Jersey.
NEUT16|We live there.
NEUT17|We like education.
NEUT18|We don't know what to do with our money.
NEUT19|All these rich people came to function and said, you tell us what to do.
NEUT20|It shows how brains is more can be more important than money and he said, well, he said, I think we.
NEUT21|If the I've got this idea about an Institute for advanced Studies, then we could put that at Princeton and it would be a huge success and being honored to you and and they said, yeah, but you know how do we know will really get it on the map and he said, well, we'll get Einstein and Bamberger said, wow, we got him because I'll go get him.
NEUT22|Well, there's a little more complicated than that, but this fellow it he influenced.
NEUT23|Half a dozen.
NEUT24|Of the wealthiest philanthropists in the country over a period of.
NEUT25|Only 30 years and they came to him.
NEUT26|I mean, it's fascinating.
NEUT27|It does show you how brains will will out and what he did wasn't complicated you can.
NEUT28|You can read this autobiography usually before I talk to agreement.
NEUT29|Touted, I buy up all the copies on Amazon Element.
BULL30|Higher prices.

NEUT32|It's I've been, my kids have all read the story and it's it's just a story.
NEUT33|What one person can do if they just think straight and and and.
NEUT34|The resources came to him.
