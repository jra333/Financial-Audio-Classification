NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video and this one.
NEUT2|We've got a lot to go over.
NEUT3|We're talking about AMC again, but we've got a huge thing to look at into because there is some volatility coming in with AMC and we have some call options that are very interesting to look at.
NEUT4|But before I go any further, I doubt that you please.

NEUT6|I'm always giving you guys news on the best stocks out there in news on AMC so you don't miss out on these great gains.
BULL7|So thanks for that and so AMC right now is currently trading at some nice volume.
NEUT8|There was 60,000 the 1st 5 minutes.
BEAR9|Of the market open, it's currently about eight 4845 central times with Mike and open about 15 minutes and the volume is kind of dying down, but that's OK. We can see it's trading on the view up and on the 13 day moving average.
BULL10|It was kind of coming up and went all the way up to about $9.13, which is a good thing to see.
NEUT11|But if we look into this little article right here.
BEAR12|The implied volatility on Antioch is incredible, and that is because the March 19th of 2021.
NEUT13|So in two weeks, the $130 dollar call option had so many highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
NEUT14|So that is incredible if we look into some AMC options, we can see just like some of these.
NEUT15|The $20 call option is 36,000 open interest.
NEUT16|These are a lot of people looking about 24,000 open interest on the $40 call option, and we can go out further on the date and just see how many open interest we have like.
NEUT17|5000 we got on the $20 fourteen thousand.
NEUT18|This is insane.
NEUT19|Open interest showing that people want these calls because they believe in agency and so call options are pretty much what it's going to cause AMC to go up there.
NEUT20|Most not just buying stocks itself but options will.
NEUT21|And if I mean the implied of all time in the open interest is insane like we can contest a stalker here.
NEUT22|Go like 7:30 only 4000 on the open interest.
NEUT23|We can even go to the $700.00 one only like yet 4000 on the open interest because people believe in AMC right now more than Tesla and they think it came to the better shot.
NEUT24|Of shooting high up in Tesla Testigo in $14.00 so it's just a good thing to see.
NEUT25|Looking at that stuff, but AMC right now, short volume ratio of 70%.
NEUT26|This was updated yesterday with a Market Volume of 78 million.
NEUT27|Anna short volume of 13 million, so it's always a good thing to see.
NEUT28|Nice volume kind of died down, but the more volume would get better.
NEUT29|And if you're looking bar chart, we're still trading at one of the most traded stocks right now with 1.9 million volume at the moment.
NEUT30|An AMC is probably 1510 on the on the list, but it could pick up can be one of the biggest stocks on this list right now, just.
BULL31|More volume equals great stuff.
NEUT32|An AMC right here there are $63 million baht worth BMC only 970,000 sold.
NEUT33|So last time we had a video and show.
NEUT34|This is where a few days ago it was like he was $58 million spot in 777 thousand soul.
NEUT35|So that's a great thing to see.
NEUT36|It shows that institutions are buying more than they are selling, which is a good thing that they're buying and buying and buying.
NEUT37|And if we look right here, we know the AMC is announcing earnings on March 10th after hours.
NEUT38|So that is exactly a week from today.
NEUT39|So we will see how that goes.
BULL40|That could be a great thing for AMC and all of us apes together if they can beat expectations.
NEUT41|So.
NEUT42|And also I wanna look at this GameStop in AMC chart.
NEUT43|And just give you guys some hope real quick.
BEAR44|Am seeing games with book down on the week.
BEAR45|Anansi is currently down for the day, but GameStop is not GameStop names like follow each other.
NEUT46|But if you look at the six month right?
NEUT47|Like I say all the time am seeing GameStop this gap is too big an if there is any true potential with AMC which I believe there is.
NEUT48|We could fill this gap very easily, so that's what I really want to see is a huge gap to get filled between this little gap so that these two lines in the six month chart look exactly the same.
