NEUT0|"""Thanks for watching this quick video on our stop Martin stock just using very simple tools of technical analysis."
NEUT1|Let's see if we are able to predict the next step of this stock.
NEUT2|As usual, I will leave with you the fundamental analysis.
NEUT3|It means that you have to study.
NEUT4|I read a lot of news about the Aston Martin and trying to check and see if both technical and fundamental analysis are on the same page.
NEUT5|In other words, we should always check the news.
BULL6|Are supporting our technical analysis, so if they can analysis as we can see in front of us, just using a very simple exponential moving average with a length of 300 shows state the stock is performing very well is going upward is a bullish trend we are expecting.
NEUT7|Also that fundamental analysis will tell us the same if it is the case, the idea would be to go longer because we got different signals from different kind of analysis.
NEUT8|One is fundamental and one is technical.
NEUT9|Both of them.
NEUT10|Telling us to go long so it's a good signal to go longer again.
NEUT11|I will live with you the fundamental analysis, but now we're going to be mainly focused, focused on we will be focusing on technical analysis.
NEUT12|As I told you exponential moving average is one of the most trustworthy tools in technical analysis.
BULL13|It worked very well as both support stay in the line.
NEUT14|He worked.
NEUT15|His support for this bottom most broken there, giving actually a little bit of.
NEUT16|You know, voting or just telling us suborning actually they're telling us that you know weakness signal of this market.
BULL17|But again it worked very well.
NEUT18|This almost, let's say where are we is almost a .5751 point, is almost £15 and 75 work very well as support for this new rarely now with my technical analysis interpretation.
NEUT19|This is to the exponential moving average, so that's why.
NEUT20|I like that tool becauses just you know, you just finds for us the trendline so bullish trend we are in.
BEAR21|We are in a bullish trend behavior.
NEUT22|So the idea would be to go along, wait this end this the end of this price retracement before going long.
BEAR23|So this price might go down up to 20 U.S. dollar.
NEUT24|This one can be seen almost as support level before going along again.
NEUT25|But generally for long term investment idea would be to go longer so.
NEUT26|Wait at the end of this, press the placement before going along again with the first target price of £23.00 and that next one will be 24 pounds and then £25 always round numbers.
NEUT27|It can be also actually 23 point, one 2028 or 23.5 round numbers are very important in technical analysis.
NEUT28|Hope you enjoy this video and then again in conclusion ideas to go long for Aston Martin.
NEUT29|Just wait at the end of this press attachment.
NEUT30|"Before going long, thanks."""
