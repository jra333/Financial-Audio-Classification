NEUT0|"""Alright, some news from Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett."
NEUT1|Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and longtime Berkshire board member, is retiring from the board pension.
NEUT2|The former American Express CEO and now the chairman of Venture Capital from General Catalyst, has been nominated to replace him.
NEUT3|Gates joined the board in 2004.
NEUT4|Mike it's been a long time to have him on that board.
NEUT5|This will be a real changing of the guard, somewhat somewhat of a change, I'm guarantees, because Bill Gates, probably, you know.
NEUT6|Over committed elsewhere probably wants to just ease back from this a little bit.
NEUT7|Catching all of course.
NEUT8|Formerly running American Express Brookshire's, by far the largest shareholder of American Express, has been for many years, so I don't think it necessarily means strategically all that much, but it's certainly keeping things within.
NEUT9|Warren Buffett Circle might just want to switch back to the markets and what we've heard in the last hour too.
NEUT10|Interesting that we just got those two news bites from Royal Caribbean Anne from Boeing.
NEUT11|It reminds us of the sectors that are most affected by this crisis in as great as it is to hear.
BEAR12|More tests are going to be available, and we're addressing the problem at its root, cause those types of companies are lacking demand and will be for the months ahead.
NEUT13|We need to wait and see whether the market is found.
BULL14|Confidence in them in a lasting fashion.
NEUT15|They enjoyed the bounce today, but a long way to go for those companies which you never know is exactly how much a market decline has frontloaded the expected difficulty to common, and a lot of times.
NEUT16|In fact, if you look at market dynamics, have this kind of very dramatic rush lower, and then you know a bouncer of strong rally like we had today.
NEUT17|And then, even if it lasts for a little while, they always say, well, you're going to shop around.
NEUT18|Maybe there's going to be another test of those.
NEUT19|Why is that?
BEAR20|It's because the bad stuff that the market anticipated with the initial drop then comes to the surface and we have to kind of contend with it again.
NEUT21|And that's the argument about the crowd psychology anyway, you know real quickly.
BULL22|We were had been talking for months about the strength of the American Sue Moran and then shouldering the burden of this global economy.
NEUT23|Is that in doubt now it's in doubt.
BEAR24|Temporarily, at least I do think so, yeah, I mean, people are retreating from from.
NEUT25|Economic life commercial life to some degree.
NEUT26|Doctor Fouchy believing in response to a question said Mom, maybe this is going to go 789 weeks?
NEUT27|Yeah, that's a good long time in terms of you know, and that's that.
NEUT28|Those are months that are more than their share of spending for the whole year.
NEUT29|"Basically into the summer that you can."""
