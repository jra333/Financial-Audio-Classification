NEUT0|"""Elephants are very much Alan."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT2|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about the long term chart of the monthly chart of Rave Restaurant Group I, NC.
NEUT3|I've talked about this talk three or four times in the last four or five months.
BEAR4|Now The thing is, because of the source, so short sightedness and lack of understanding of many people.
NEUT5|Those who are new in the market.
NEUT6|It's not about feeling you know, angry or it's not about.
NEUT7|I'm bullying somebody, but The thing is because people don't look beyond a particular time, and if the stock don't move for two or three months, even after you have purchased, you will feel sorry now find out the reasons for that.
NEUT8|Don't buy an feel sorry for that because you should understand that.
NEUT9|Stocks will not move because you are buying the stock.
NEUT10|No.
NEUT11|This kind of talk, specifically this array restaurant Group I NC, particularly this stop now.
NEUT12|The thing is, maybe let's say maybe the.
BEAR13|Current crisis health crisis will stay even for this particular calendar year.
NEUT14|I'm hypothetically saying it will not and we will see in the second half things is going to be better one.
NEUT15|Because there are lots of vaccination drive which are going on and probably we have cure in the upcoming months as well.
NEUT16|So do you think that stock will wait for the crisis to get over and then start moving 'cause you want to wait?
NEUT17|No it's not going to happen.
NEUT18|Because.
NEUT19|Stock will sense things all the market will sense things much ahead than individuals are.
NEUT20|And if you're looking at this stock.
BEAR21|So from the loss of 38 or $0.39, it has already moved by 330%.
NEUT22|Maybe the speed of the movement is slow when compared to other stock, but the good thing is it is moving an moving higher OK an when things.
BULL23|Looks good.
NEUT24|By that time you will not get the same price which you have right now.
NEUT25|So that's the truth and that's the thing you need to understand over here.
NEUT26|Now, if you are looking beyond couple of weeks and months.
NEUT27|In that case we have particular levels to look at.
NEUT28|It will start with.
NEUT29|3.3 then you have 6.5.
NEUT30|You have $9.
NEUT31|And it can go up to.
NEUT32|In a very good scenario.
NEUT33|It can go up to 15 or $17.00.
NEUT34|I would say this is $1516.00 but The thing is don't try to go below $0.70.
NEUT35|This is the lower end of the range and if the stock in any case falls below $0.70, there is no need carry any position.
NEUT36|Or The thing is and the most important part is, the stock is sustaining over 1.45, so you can use 1.45 as your support or even stop loss if you want to go very strictly.
BULL37|But if it continues to hold out that we will have very good levels on the outside in the weeks as well as in the months to come.
NEUT38|So this is the end of the video.
