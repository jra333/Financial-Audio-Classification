NEUT0|"""Paul, if you're right, what do you do about it?"
NEUT1|So as an investor today, based on what you're talking about, we haven't seen that sell off yet.
NEUT2|Maybe people are going to wait to see what the actual election portends.
NEUT3|Would you try to get ahead of that?
NEUT4|How?
NEUT5|How would you trade it if you will?
BEAR6|I've been unfortunately trying to get ahead of it for far too long in the past few weeks and it's been wrong.
NEUT7|Again, and the reason why I prefaced all of this by saying we're going to have so much volatility.
NEUT8|You're gonna also have passed at some point in the next 6 to 8 weeks, 12 weeks, you're going to have the first stimulus package, which is going to be around 1.7 trillion.
NEUT9|Battle probably be effective sometime in the first quarter of next year and sometime in February.
NEUT10|Let's say you're going to have $700 billion February and March, not 700.
NEUT11|The total package, let's say, will be 700.
NEUT12|Being then it will ultimately end up in the bank accounts of Americans.
NEUT13|And we saw what happened when that happened last April and May Robin Hood Nation.
NEUT14|The other Robin Hood nation.
NEUT15|Went crazy and bought stocks and so you're going to have at some point in the first quarter.
NEUT16|Next year you're going to have a big move to the upside from whatever level that might be.
NEUT17|As people get cash from this first stimulus program and they deploy that in a variety of financial assets, which could be stocks and bonds.
NEUT18|So it's going to be really tricky.
NEUT19|I could easily see a situation where the market sells off in the year in, and then you have that.
NEUT20|Typical beginning of the year rally that might ramp all the way through the end of the first, certainly in the mid part of the first quarter.
NEUT21|All of that pool when we go ahead.
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
