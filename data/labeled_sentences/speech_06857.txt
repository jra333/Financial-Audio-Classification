NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol BA Boeing.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well the bleeding on Boeing continues.
BEAR5|It was pretty much almost straight down the entire day.
BULL6|Now granted the price did gap up a little bit and then after that first 30 minutes.
NEUT7|I mean, that's that's a steep channel right there.
BEAR8|So a whole lot of downward pressure hit it today and definitely updates need to be made here as we head into Friday.
NEUT9|First thing to do is little house cleaning.
NEUT10|Go ahead and get rid of that line up there.
NEUT11|Sure, that level pertains just not relevant right now and for presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing confusion and clutter.
NEUT12|'cause there's lines are very lucky, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible moving forward.
NEUT13|But as far as updates now that need to be made first update is just based on a foundation rule in charge in which states when levels of support are broken enclosed below, they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT14|So right here at 2:25, that is now going to be the main level of resistance.
NEUT15|Where there is any sort of attempted consolidation and then movement back to the upside, that's where the big question mark resides of, you know, can the price actually get up above 625?
NEUT16|Because really, any sort of upward movement before then could very well just be a dead cat bounce.
NEUT17|It could be something like this where the price bounces up and then rolls back over.
NEUT18|Even right there bounces up rolls back over, bounces up rolls back over.
NEUT19|I'm not saying that the price does go back up to 225, that's for sure.
NEUT20|Going to rollback over my point here is that I would say be very skeptical of any sort of upward movement until the price can at least prove itself a little bit.
NEUT21|And in this situation, well, OK, how can it prove itself?
NEUT22|Well, that is where 225 comes into play again, not only getting back up to that level, but then being model able to break above it and stay above it.
NEUT23|So watch that from the resistant side of things.
NEUT24|As far as areas of support or concern.
BULL25|Gotta squeeze things down here a little bit.
NEUT26|As we head into the past history.
BEAR27|And it's been quite awhile since the price went down around this area, but next key area of supports keep an eye on my mind going to be right there at the $320 mark and then at 320 cannot quite hold up next key level after that down there, right around the 218 mark, so 222 eighteen next couple areas of support moving forward.
BEAR28|But yeah, the downward pressure definitely continues.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live.
NEUT31|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT39|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT40|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot.
NEUT41|Which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
