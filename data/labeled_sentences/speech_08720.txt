BULL0|"""Hey traders, changing CEO and President alphashark.com so I think the market is oversold and I think we're going to bounce back and one of the opportunities I was looking at eBay."
BEAR1|I saw a big buyer of Nov 37 an if it holds is low.
BULL2|I think it can reverse an move higher.
BEAR3|So what I see here is eBay looking at buying stock here and I got into this trade at 3360 so stop loss is going to be way under the lows at 3160 so by eBay stock 3360 stop loss 31.
NEUT4|60 Risking $2.00 target one would be 3460 and then 3660 thirty 3560 which is right in the gap level.
NEUT5|"I will take this off before earnings buying 500 shares with $1000 Everest in eBay 3360 thanks and will run it back tomorrow."""
