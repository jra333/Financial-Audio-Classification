NEUT0|"""Alright, so polls are one way of trying to figure out who's going to win."
NEUT1|Watching the markets are another.
NEUT2|They're pretty good at predicting elections sometimes too.
NEUT3|Joining us right now is Ryan Dietrich.
NEUT4|He is senior market strategist at LPL Financial Research.
NEUT5|Ann Ryan.
BULL6|The markets been pretty calm at this point.
NEUT7|Do you think they're predicting one side or the other winning?
NEUT8|Well, we think it's a lot closer.
NEUT9|Maybe what the polls say.
NEUT10|You know you think about right now.
BULL11|Since August 3rd, the S&P is up over 7%.
NEUT12|You guys, when you go back in history since the Great Depression, when the SNP's up that much three months before an election, the incumbent president has neverlost.
NEUT13|There are three for three.
NEUT14|Winning now, I know that's a small sample size and we get it.
NEUT15|2020 is much different than when you consider the fact that you know real per capita incomes up this year pretty good.
NEUT16|Now I know it's 'cause of the cares act.
NEUT17|So put it.
NEUT18|Put a big disclaimer next to that.
BULL19|Also, U.S. dollar a week U.S. dollar historically is better for the incumbent.
NEUT20|Already to win, so you got all these things.
NEUT21|Factoring with that big GDP number, we're likely going to see.
NEUT22|We think it's maybe closer to a coin flip that what you know, what a lot of people think.
NEUT23|Kinda like maybe four years ago.
NEUT24|It's closer than what the experts are saying.
NEUT25|If you kind of pay attention, account with the market is telling us in the economy in our view.
NEUT26|Which is why you are saying that you're taking a barbell approach to this.
NEUT27|What does that mean?
NEUT28|Absolutely, you know barbell approach means stick with who got you there and also who might take over the economy does better.
NEUT29|First off look at technology, look at, you know communications.
NEUT30|Those are where the earnings are coming from.
NEUT31|I mean this upcoming earnings season.
NEUT32|That's where a lot of the growth is going to come from.
NEUT33|So we still like that.
NEUT34|Look at technology it yesterday, right?
NEUT35|Huge day obviously.
NEUT36|And again, that's more he could say.
NEUT37|Maybe even more pro President Trump, like the other side of things, is kind of the cyclical value all here.
NEUT38|Cyclical value.
NEUT39|We really like those materials.
NEUT40|We really like industrial, so those would take us a major leadership of the economy, opens up and does better the second half or.
NEUT41|Better next year, that group can do well everyones to pick a favorite sector really.
NEUT42|Maybe kind of do that barbell approach is a really nice way for your average investor.
BULL43|Probably have some nice gains.
NEUT44|Next 12 to 18 months.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
