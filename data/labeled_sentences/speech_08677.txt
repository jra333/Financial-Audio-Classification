NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one in the bear bear sense.
BEAR5|Granted, the markets were having a very rough day, so it's not like the markets were exploding and then Apple was going down.
NEUT6|Nothing like that, you know, was playing out.
BEAR7|It was just a rough day for the markets.
NEUT8|Rough day for Apple, so it is what it is.
NEUT9|Updates need to be done here.
NEUT10|First thing to do is get rid of these lines up here.
NEUT11|Yes, these levels still pretending the chart, but from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT12|'cause there's lines are very long, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible.
NEUT13|So first key level that needs to be updated and this just based on a foundation rule in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT14|So right up there at 1:10, fifty is going to be that main area of resistance where you can see the price tried.
BULL15|I mean, it really did try this morning to stay up above that level and it did do a good job going sideways there, but ultimately just too much downward pressure from all directions and then down it went quite a bit.
NEUT16|So keep an eye on that level.
NEUT17|But really, even before you put any focus on that level, the first key area of resistance now in the very near term is going to be that purple line right there, which on my chart denotes the very well known, the very famous 50.
NEUT18|Moving average, and that's currently valid.
NEUT19|It let's just call it 108, sixty five.
NEUT20|So 108 sixty five is going to be the first key battleground.
NEUT21|And then if the price can push up through there, then yeah, the next key level would be up around the one 1050 Mark now.
NEUT22|As far as areas of support or concern, first key level to keep a close eye on moving forward.
NEUT23|Going to be right down here at the 106 fifty mark and then after 106 fifty next key level.
NEUT24|Down at the 104 fifty mark, so keep an eye on those couple levels going forward.
NEUT25|But yeah on all rough day today, but we'll see if Apple can try to get things turned around or not moving forward.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had.
BEAR29|One losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to.
NEUT36|Too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.

NEUT41|"I'll be seeing you soon."""
