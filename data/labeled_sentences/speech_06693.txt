BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to technical analysis here."
BEAR1|Theexact.com it's June 28th and today we're going to look at the Kiwi dollar, which recorded its biggest daily loss in four months.
BEAR2|Yesterday on the back of weaker business confidence readings and trade tensions between the US and China.
BEAR3|While early today, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand kept interest rates steady as expected, but expressed concerns on economic growth and trade, sending key dollar to fresh two year lows.
BEAR4|And now for zoom into the daily chart, we can see that the market has stretched its downtrend from Zero point 7393 to zero point 6767, the lowest since May 2016, and it seems that we might see further downside in the short term because if you look at the gym, Aqua indicators have the red tank on sale line has increased distance below the Blue King just in line suggesting that negative momentum might stay in place in the short term.
BEAR5|They might be down here supports this view as well since it's currently moving strongly in the negative direction.
NEUT6|Are below it red signal line thoughtful look at their site.
BEAR7|This is negatively sloped below 50, giving additional various signals.
BEAR8|But it's also on track to enter the oversold territory below 30, which means that upside corrections are not unlikely in the short term, so now the price extends, losses.
BULL9|Support could immediately come between 0.67 and Zero Point 6670 were there market fund support and resistance back in 2016 and 2015.
NEUT10|Other step lower quick Patch.
BULL11|This year point 1666 key level.
NEUT12|Before we head down to their zero point 65, which was another frequently tested area in the past on the way up.
BULL13|However, we could look for resistance at Zero Point 6840, which other market rebounding here in mid May as well as back in 2017.
NEUT14|So it could be a potential level to watch before we test the 20 day and the 50 day moving average lines at zero point 69.
NEUT15|50 further above from here attention could then turn to Zero Point 7058 resistance that the market found hard to break for a couple of days in early June.
NEUT16|Finally looking at the medium term picture.
BULL17|How the outlook here switched from neutral to bearish after the market fell below Zero Point 7150 and for boost to come back into play, we need to see a rally above zero point 7435.
NEUT18|So that's all from me.
BULL19|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
