NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Danya sent today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about Mustang Beer Incorporated, who is stickier MBR and you can see that this talk has 211% in implied volatility and it means that someone betting that this talk in one month will make more than 100%.
NEUT2|And I really like this kind of traits because you can make.
NEUT3|A lots of money in a low amount of time and now actually someone buying $5 call options with expiration time only 30 days for $20 a pair lot our regular price have to be like $10 or maybe a lower here you can see a Mustang via pipeline and it is quite diversified and they're working.
NEUT4|In an unish it is again therapy in the cartage ecology.
NEUT5|On this slide you can see how this technology works and they just taking your cells out of you and then train them to kill through Mercer and bring back them into your body.
NEUT6|It cost lots of money, but.
NEUT7|You can survive a really bad cancer, and some of them have a mortality rate like 100% and it is really neither thing to treat, but this technology, a little bit expensive and here you can see why?
NEUT8|Because you need like 19 plus days to get infusion and.
NEUT9|All these things that cost a really high amount of money, and I think one treatment will cost you like $200,000 + -- 100,000.
NEUT10|Maybe this high volatility related to presentation on an old prostate cancer.
NEUT11|They because it is ongoing right now.
NEUT12|And when I'm watching this chart I think it is really possible to go somewhere here.
NEUT13|And maybe somewhere here it is not a problem for this talk because we already saw something like this in April 2019.
BULL14|I couldn't find something interesting in institutional ownership, but some guys buying it and it is definitely A plus.
NEUT15|I think if we will buy and hold it for maybe month and just wait for a good news.
BULL16|It will be a good idea.
