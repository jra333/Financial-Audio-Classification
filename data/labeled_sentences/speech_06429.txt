NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm James early advisor for The Motley Fool Income Investor newsletter and I'm here as part of the ask a full series where we answer your questions."
NEUT1|Today's question is from Miguel.
NEUT2|Miguel asks depending on the amount of cash I have to invest and professional knowledge about investing.
NEUT3|Which investing profile would you recommend?
NEUT4|Day trading, swing trading or position trading?
NEUT5|Parentheses value investing.
NEUT6|Miguel, without a doubt the answer is swing trading.
NEUT7|Actually, I'm kidding.
NEUT8|I don't even know what swing trading is Miguel.
NEUT9|I'm glad you asked this question.
NEUT10|I think in one form or another it's on the minds of many, many people.
NEUT11|We've got all these offers coming to us advertisements about ways to invest, and many of them are short term like swing trading for instance.
NEUT12|So what do you make of it?
NEUT13|Well, I'll give you a quick assignment Miguel.
NEUT14|Next time you're on Google.
NEUT15|Look for Barbara and Odino DEA and these are two professors from California who have done a lot of research on what makes individual investors succeed.
BEAR16|And fail, and pretty much the number one thing they found that causes individual investors to underperform.
NEUT17|The market is over trading and unfortunately that's what so many of these short term strategies are predicated on.
BEAR18|In fact, women outperform men slightly as investors, not because women necessarily pick better stocks, but because men trade too frequently.
NEUT19|It's kind of like the remote control were just a little too busy, and if you're honest, we need to pull that back a little bit.
NEUT20|So if you look at Warren Buffett, if you look at many of the best investors over many decades these guys haven't traded a lot.
BULL21|They found quality businesses, and they've held them for long periods of time.
NEUT22|That's what I'd suggest you Miguel to study up on.
NEUT23|Think about that.
NEUT24|I would be careful of all these these marketing offers.
NEUT25|Anyone who's very confident about something and investing is to be suspected.
NEUT26|I think it's just not a mixed confidence in investing.
BEAR27|Don't go well together.
NEUT28|It's a probabilistic endeavour.
NEUT29|The longer the people who made money over the long term have not tried to jump in and make short term profit, health, good businesses.
NEUT30|That's what I recommend you consider doing Miguel and keep reading and watching here at the Fool Fool on people on the show may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.
NEUT31|"Don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear."""
