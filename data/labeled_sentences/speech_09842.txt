BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about Gevo.
NEUT2|I'll be talking about the price action that we've seen today, as well as an update on the earnings report coming out on March 17th and then at the end of the video.
NEUT3|I'll be talking about why I think Jeff has a ton of potential, so stick around.
NEUT4|But before I get into the video, make sure to subscribe button to keep up with the daily videos and check out the links down below in the description to join the Patreon is also going to be a link in there to join the free Discord as well.
NEUT5|Alright, so taking a look at Gevo so far today, the stocks at $9.95 that I'm recording this and the high so far in the day is $10.42.
BEAR6|The stock has seen a great recovery so far after dropping all the way down to a low of $5.70 back on March 5th, which was last Friday.
BULL7|So it's good to see that Jeeves following this overall market recovery so far, but we do have earnings coming up and we know earnings.
NEUT8|Cowboys play big factor into stock price, so here's what we're expecting to hear from earnings on March 17th.
BULL9|We're expecting Gevo to announce a year over year increase in earnings, although on lower revenues when they report their earnings were also expecting for the fourth quarter.
BEAR10|A loss of $0.04 per share, which represent a 92% increase year over year change.
BEAR11|The expected revenues are 760,000, which is down 89% from the 2019 fourth quarter.
NEUT12|So now that we have expected earnings coming out, we can kind of get a hint of what we're expecting to hear so that we can make an investment decision based on that.
NEUT13|So we know if Geo beats his expectations.
BULL14|That could help us talk push up higher, but the opposite is also true.
BEAR15|Approval misses these expectations.
BEAR16|We could see a bit of a drop.
BULL17|I personally think Java is going to be expectations by quite a bit and help push this stock price higher.
NEUT18|So if you're someone who's holding the stock long term, I wouldn't be worried about holding through earnings.
BULL19|Even if we do see a bit of a dip, because I think long term Gevo is going to be great.
BEAR20|There's also a lot of traders that don't like the hole through earnings, so even with good earnings, I think you may see a small dip in price, which really I think is insignificant in the long term scope of things.
BULL21|I think the long term potential for this company is huge and I'm super bullish on it.
NEUT22|My price prediction is still going to stand C $50 by the end of the year.
NEUT23|So I'm super excited for this talk going forward because I think we should be getting some new contracts over the course of the year, especially as we get closer to the end of the year when we start getting these net zero plants being built in closer to operational for more of a mid term price prediction for Gevo I'm looking at it be around $25 by the end of May and then as I said, $50 by the end of the year.
NEUT24|So I'm expecting they would be earnings and get a nice little boost from this, but what do you guys think will givo be earnings?
