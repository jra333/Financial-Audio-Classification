NEUT0|"""Weekly Google Chart 1127 2011."
NEUT1|One of the things that we're going to focus on is that we closed at 563.
NEUT2|This will go with the weekly option strategies that are forward looking for.
NEUT3|The following week, starting tomorrow and December.
NEUT4|And we even have buying opportunities that go out to March of 2012.
NEUT5|One of the things that will cover.
NEUT6|So that the Rising 10 week moving average went from a bear to a bull were still in the bull trim.
NEUT7|We're at key 50 week.
NEUT8|We're at key 20 week and the ten week moving averages can flag.
NEUT9|Is 570.03.
NEUT10|The 50 week moving average can flag.
NEUT11|Currently year to date and it can change every day, you know.
NEUT12|But it's 564.76.
NEUT13|That's the pink 50 line, the 20 week moving average.
NEUT14|Ken flag it was at 563.84.
NEUT15|Am we closed right there at that 20 week?
NEUT16|The Hundred Week moving average can flag is at 548.66 and you need to set alarms rises to the 10 week.
BEAR17|And set alarms slightly below the key weekly moving averages because ultimately.
BEAR18|This is going to be the weekly resistance levels over here everyone.
NEUT19|I'm going to draw this this zone right here.
BEAR20|This was the earnings week related at gaps up.
NEUT21|At moves in that weekly bar during this weekly bar.
NEUT22|I.
NEUT23|Was part of the earnings that came out with Google, and here is the sell down with all other tech stocks, Internet stocks, broader market liquidation.
NEUT24|We're going to be watching this key support level up here.
BEAR25|The next level of interest is going to be slightly below that hundred week moving average, and that's about 547.
NEUT26|That's this horizontal trendline right above it.
NEUT27|Well, set the alarms.
NEUT28|We still have a one week, two week, three week, four week, five weekly, five consecutive week by Signal that's getting peeked out.
NEUT29|Up here it's getting a little, but it's a weekly by signal.
NEUT30|This is the difference in the pullback phases whereas before.
NEUT31|When you were trading it.
NEUT32|When you're in the weekly sell signals.
BULL33|And you still go up and go down, but the pull backs are a lot stronger.
NEUT34|What the weekly cell signal and play on on the bellwether app, Google Google does really well.
BULL35|Moving forward, we feel there's another support level down here all the way in this trendline.
NEUT36|That's about 527, but once again, when you pull back from short term selling.
NEUT37|You get these key weekly moving averages that are supposed to act as support levels within Structured Bull.
BULL38|New Born Bull Trend which was above the ten week rising for four weeks 123456 and we were up there six weeks above it.
NEUT39|7th week.
NEUT40|We kind of closed below it but it's only week one.
BEAR41|It would take the 10 week to roll over and you would have to be resistance at this level and we would sell down lower should the market do that.
NEUT42|Not individually.
BEAR43|Google's been selling off because people been liquidating their great winning asset to pay off other debts.
NEUT44|So that's a different story.
NEUT45|Worldwide economic confusion, worldwide disasters and play.
NEUT46|It doesn't matter.
NEUT47|"What matters is this has got value to it, and we're looking at that weekly support level."""
