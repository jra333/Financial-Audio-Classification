NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol IQ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will quite the crazy.
NEUT5|Crazy day once again on this one, although end of the day.
NEUT6|Very very interesting because you gotta give credit where credits do a very impressive balance.
NEUT7|I mean something about the fact that at one point the price that actually gone all the way down there.
NEUT8|But then all of a sudden the price closed all the way up there.
BULL9|Now yes, of course the price is a lot of work that needs to be done, but point here being from where the price was that was able to move back up to nice solid move.
NEUT10|But that does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT11|But is there any sort of true power behind this price?
NEUT12|When is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT13|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT14|Dead Cat Bounce, type move, and I have no idea.
NEUT15|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
BEAR16|In that area is down here at the $16.00 mark.
NEUT17|Now why 16 important?
NEUT18|I'm not saying this was going to happen, but if the price were to come down in that area, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT19|What would that do to the price?
NEUT20|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart where it just was and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT21|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT22|But to be fair, no price just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT23|Behave in that manner and then start to work the way back upwards now.
NEUT24|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT25|What's the difference?
NEUT26|Well, now you have a set of those right there.
NEUT27|You have Lowe's down there, and if you envision each one of those steps, well, hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward struction.
NEUT28|And that's what it truly strong was going to do.
BULL29|It's going to make progress.
NEUT30|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 16.
NEUT31|Now if the price continues on up as far as some of these next levels of resistance are concern, next, key battleground going to be right up there at $18.25 and then after 1825, next key level up there right around $19.50.
NEUT32|So keep around those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT33|But on all.
NEUT34|Any angle you look at it, very impressive balance.
NEUT35|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this balance next week, let's see what happens.
NEUT36|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you.
NEUT46|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT47|That is again totally live.
