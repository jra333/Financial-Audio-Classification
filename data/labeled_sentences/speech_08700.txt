NEUT0|"""Hey, it's June six Thursday."
NEUT1|Dan Charles was simpletrades.net and Weed stock pro here.
NEUT2|And I'm looking at Oxy stock, Oxy symbol, OXY and I feel like this is bottomed out.
NEUT3|You can see on the weekly chart it has the appearance of a stock that's.
BEAR4|Bottomed out and same thing with the monthly chart.
NEUT5|It just looks like it's it wants a rebound so.
BEAR6|I'm going to look at this stock tomorrow and see if I can get in and often want to stocks been dropping like this.
NEUT7|You can get a nice pop, a nice one to three day Pop.
NEUT8|And make a little bit of money and get in, get out and move on to the next stock.
NEUT9|So let's see how this gets on in the next next day or two and see if I can.
NEUT10|Take a position.
BEAR11|OK, it's several days later on Oxy and I didn't get into this trade because it gapped down the next day.
NEUT12|But I just wanted to make a video showing that I was right about the direction.
NEUT13|So sometimes I'm just right about the direction, but I don't get in the trade and that's OK, but I just want to show that.
NEUT14|My analysis was correct.
NEUT15|I don't get into all these trades 'cause I'm looking at so many different stocks.
NEUT16|Like 600 plus stocks every day I'm analyzing with the scanner and I'm trying to find the most reliable ones that give me the best shot of making money in the next one to three days.
NEUT17|And this to me looked like a stock that was due for a rebound for many reasons, but especially the monthly chart is really overextended and due for a rebound.
NEUT18|So I just wanted to make that video showing that I was correct on the direction but missed the trade.
NEUT19|Thank you for watching this video.
