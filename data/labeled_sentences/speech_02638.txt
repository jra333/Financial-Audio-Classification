NEUT0|"""Some level of taxation is needed to fund government services to the benefit of the whole economy."
BEAR1|Above a certain point, however, higher taxes can hurt growth.
NEUT2|It is often the misnamed taxes that do the most damage, because politically they are sold as something else to masquerade the fact that they're really a tax increase for the economic system.
NEUT3|Let's take 2 examples first, tariffs.
NEUT4|Tariffs are attacks on trade.
NEUT5|One can argue about who pays the tax.
NEUT6|Yet from a global perspective it matters not at all.
BEAR7|Who pays someone pays global trade slows down, global growth, slows down any country that is part of the global trading system is going to feel some pain.
NEUT8|Sure, some countries will feel more pain than others, but there's plenty of pain to go around.
NEUT9|As we have come to learn, the US tax increases look more and more like a permanent tax increase.
NEUT10|So these tariffs are going to be permanent.
BEAR11|Global growth is going to slow slower US growth in the second half is highly likely no matter how much the Fed cuts rates, because the problem is not high rates.
NEUT12|The problem is.
NEUT13|Tariffs and taxes.
BEAR14|Second, negative interest rates negative interest rates are attacks.
NEUT15|Again, it matters little if the negative rate tax hits banks or their depositers the economic system is going to feel the pain from the tax.
BEAR16|There will be less lending from banks and growth will be inhibited.
NEUT17|The idea that lowering interest rates below 0 or even further below 0 is there thinking about in Europe is a form of monetary stimulus.
NEUT18|It's just not.
BEAR19|It's a mistaken idea.
NEUT20|Central bankers, of course, do not like to admit mistakes.
NEUT21|So mistakes only get corrected when there is a change at the top of the central bank.
NEUT22|In the case of the European Central Bank, change in leadership will arrive in October 2019.
NEUT23|We'll see whether the new leadership removes the tax to stimulate the European economy.
