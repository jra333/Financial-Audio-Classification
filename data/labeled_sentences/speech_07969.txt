NEUT0|"""The Russell 2000 is a an index of small cap stocks, so it's a very good measure of how smaller companies in America are faring."
NEUT1|When most Americans hear about the stock market on the news every night, they hear about either the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which encapsulate really the biggest companies in America and are good.
NEUT2|Gauge of how the market overall is performing.
NEUT3|Another way of looking at the market is the Russell 3000 Index, which purports to encapsulate 98% of the total of U.S. stock market.
NEUT4|If you breakdown the Russell 3000 to the Russell 2000 that takes the smallest 2000 companies from the Russell 3000, though they make up 2/3 of the Russell 3000, they're only 10% of the actual value of the index, so the Russell 2000 Index is a gauge of the 2000 smallest companies.
NEUT5|In the Russell 3000.
BULL6|So really, in plain English, it's a very good benchmark for small cap stocks.
NEUT7|In general, the average market cap in that index is 1 1/2 billion, roughly 1 1/2 billion.
NEUT8|The median market cap is only 500,000,000 if you look at the list of top Holdings in the index.
NEUT9|It's likely that you've not heard of them.
NEUT10|United Rentals.
NEUT11|Skechers is maybe a stock.
NEUT12|People have heard of that is in the Russell 2000, so an investor can own the Russell 2000 Index.
NEUT13|The whole thing very easily through index fund or an ETF and exchange traded fund.
NEUT14|There's a very widely held, very popular one.
NEUT15|The iShares Russell 2000 Index, the ticker symbol is IWM.
NEUT16|Very liquid, very low cost, gives you broad exposure to the small cap asset class.
NEUT17|Most investors would do well to have exposure to small cap stocks.
BULL18|There are studies that show that small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks over time, particularly small cap value stocks.
BEAR19|And so really investors are likely under exposed to that asset class.
NEUT20|You hear a lot about the biggest companies you hear a lot about the Dow and the S&P.
NEUT21|It's likely that people own mutual funds or index funds that give exposure to those sorts of companies.
NEUT22|But if you want exposure to a different asset class that is potentially faster, growing small cap stocks are really good place to be, and the Russell 2000 is a good index to either track with an ETF for an index fund.
NEUT23|Or it's a good benchmark to measure whatever your small cap portfolio is performing.
NEUT24|"You would want to measure it against how the Russell 2000 is performing."""
