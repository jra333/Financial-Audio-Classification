NEUT5|Just to go over a quick recap of the past couple days, I said that.
NEUT6|If I was looking at starting a position.
BULL7|Here would have been the ideal spot.
NEUT8|I've been saying that since we were halfway coming down this channel.
BULL9|So since we had this an multiple other stocks have found support within their trends and charts.
BULL10|We've rallied up a couple days now.
NEUT11|Traditionally, after you know basically 1/2.
NEUT12|This is the third day.
NEUT13|Rally, we would want to look at.
NEUT14|Some form of pullback now there I could see that happening either too.
NEUT15|Easy there a we head up to hit this resistance and we you know do either halfway retracement or a full retracement or B.
NEUT16|We break above this in some capacity either here or here.
NEUT17|And then at that point we can sort of consolidate for a little bit, and then at that point move higher.
NEUT18|There's nothing to say that.
BULL19|We get some decent news and we rally up.
NEUT20|But yeah.
NEUT21|In general, if you got in down here, it's not a bad time to start taking profits, or at least some right.
BEAR22|"I mean, you could at least take some and then if we break below what 116 you can stop."""
