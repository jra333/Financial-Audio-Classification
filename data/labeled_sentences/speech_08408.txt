NEUT0|"""From daily Forex, is Chris taking a look at the energy markets."
NEUT1|This is WTI crude oil and you can see the WTI.
BEAR2|It's just been all over the place.
NEUT3|Nobody knows what to do with this Federal Reserve.
NEUT4|50 bits.
BEAR5|Racon that happened during the session, how it would ever drive demand for oil up is beyond me because this is a health crisis that people are worried about and we had been suffering before hand from a lack of demand and oversupply.
BEAR6|So this is probably going to fall flat on its face from the Fed standpoint, 50 day Ma if we get there at a selling opportunity then close to it really is.
BEAR7|I do think that we continue to go lower.
NEUT8|Short term traders may wish to short this market based upon the daily charts.
BULL9|Nat Gas tried to rally as well.
NEUT10|Again, who cares?
NEUT11|This is the 50 day Ma and this is a $2.00 level.
BEAR12|This is just a miserable market.
NEUT13|Again, nothing's changed.
NEUT14|We need bankruptcies.
BEAR15|We need people to go out of business in order for natural gas to actually catch a sustainable bid.
NEUT16|"Rallies are to be sold that continues to be the mantra here."""
