NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, the upwards move continues, so overall the chart looks perfectly fine an ICEE overall, because I do realize that there is a segment of people out there that have the perspective of, you know, being a day trader they bought right there.
NEUT5|There are plans to buy himself in 10 minutes and then the price holy pulled back on him.
NEUT6|So from that perspective, yet the chart actually doesn't look very good for you, but assuming you do care bout the overall viewpoint of things, then even with the nice movement this morning that were the prices we did pull back, everything is still perfectly fine.
NEUT7|'cause you still do have those higher lows being put in place and that is by far what matters most.
NEUT8|So first up, do here though, is just a justice level of support.
BULL9|Now up to the 128 mark that represented the ideal level of support.
NEUT10|If you ask, they won't make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward.
BULL11|Well, ideally if the price can say above 128, that would be a fantastic sign of strength.
NEUT12|With that being said, don't get me wrong, it's not like if the price falls below that level.
NEUT13|That implies the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT14|But you have the price could manage the above there.
NEUT15|That would be fantastic sign of power taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|But with Purple line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average.
NEUT18|Keyword being moving so as time goes by, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move.
NEUT19|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT21|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|His visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT24|Sure, stand above 128 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|Nothing fancy or complicated here till about that red line up there which I talked about in past videos that represents 3025.
BULL26|I will say that it continues to get closer and closer to within range.
NEUT27|So who knows, maybe even the price will do battle with it on Friday, but let's see how this one closes out the week.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL32|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up.
