NEUT0|"""More guys, that was a little bit underwhelming, were supposed to go to the moon today."
NEUT1|I was hopeful that we would but we didn't.
NEUT2|So let's talk about AMC.
NEUT3|This is investing with jacks I'm jacks.
NEUT4|This is not financial advice.
NEUT5|This is a brand new channel so if you enjoy this video make sure to drop it.
NEUT6|A big fat like subscribe and turn on that Bell if you're new.
NEUT7|So let's talk about it.
NEUT8|The market opens.
BULL9|We see EMC surge up to $17.00 a share.
NEUT10|Everybody's excited, let's go to 20 and then it just falls right off.
NEUT11|We go down.
NEUT12|All the way down to 14 tons of people start selling and we sit at 14 most of the day.
NEUT13|1430 fourteen, 9514, eighteen and then closer to the end of the day, we start seeing people sell, sell, sell.
BEAR14|It drops all the way down to 1314 and we end the day at 1332.
NEUT15|We closed on Friday at 1326.
NEUT16|So what is this mean for AMC?
NEUT17|Are we going to see the moon in my personal opinion?
NEUT18|And I hate to say this, I really don't think so.
NEUT19|And I'm really a Cup half full kind of person.
NEUT20|But when you think about all the people who came in just for the hype, all the people who are really new or don't know that much about investing, they buy into GME.
BULL21|They buy into AMC and on Monday they see it surge up.
BEAR22|They either take their profits or they see it starting to dip and everyone panic sells.
NEUT23|Everyone starts selling, selling, selling.
BEAR24|We don't have enough buying pressure.
BULL25|There was quite a bit of volume but definitely not as much as last week.
NEUT26|So my prediction for tomorrow.
NEUT27|Honestly, like I said, I'm a Cup half full kind of person.
NEUT28|I do have 70 shares of AMC.
NEUT29|I am going to for sure hold it just for the principle to stick it to the big guys on Wall Street.
BULL30|So I'm going to say, and I'm going to hope it goes to 14 fifty $15.00 if it goes to $16.00, that would be a miracle.
NEUT31|If it goes any higher than the Sky is the limit.
BULL32|However, I do think it could continue to dip, but I'm going to say 14 fifty, $15, hopefully higher spending crazy day.
NEUT33|I wish it it Sky rocketed like we all hoped it would, but we'll have to see what happens tomorrow.
NEUT34|Right guys?
NEUT35|I hope you didn't put your whole mortgage in there.
NEUT36|I hope you didn't put your whole savings account in there.
NEUT37|You only put money that you are willing to lose because it's high risk, high reward.
NEUT38|The rocket ship kind of went like.
NEUT39|Today when you know maybe the engines will pick up and will go straight to the Moon, will see what happens.
NEUT40|Anyways guys, that's it for this prediction.
BULL41|I hope you guys enjoyed it.
NEUT42|If you did drop the video big fat like hit that Bell.
NEUT43|If you're new and I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT44|Much love guys.
NEUT45|"Take care."""
