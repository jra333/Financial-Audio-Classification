NEUT1|Doing some.
BULL2|Analytical work here as we get ready for Asian session, it should be pretty interesting session as we do have a lot of young news.
NEUT3|In related news we have job applicants, unemployment rate, overall household spending, large retailers, sales, retail trade.
NEUT4|And that's all going to be coming out between 7:30 PM and 7:45 PM Eastern Standard Time.
NEUT5|Now what I'm looking at here on the four hour chart is a bit divergent from going to see if that's going to play out.
BULL6|He did have the trendline break, and we're coming back up here to retest.
BEAR7|Once again, this is the four hour chart and you could see the decrease in momentum as we were moving up here.
NEUT8|Really not much follow through on the daily chart here.
NEUT9|We have a possible reversal candle, so I'm going to keep all this in mind as we enter into the Asian session and I'll be watching this particular pair ferry close.
NEUT10|As far as the other timeframes in particular, the one hour.
NEUT11|I mean, it's really just trending higher, may form what looks to be like a head and shoulders here, but I don't want to speculate.
NEUT12|As we have to see, maybe two or three more candles to confirm that, but.
NEUT13|Once again will be watching this very close.
NEUT14|This is the dollar versus the yen.
NEUT15|If I engage any signals, of course I'll send out some alerts in Asian session to members.
