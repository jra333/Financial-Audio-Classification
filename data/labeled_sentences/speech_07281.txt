NEUT0|"""Alright, so if you watch my last video I made the bull case on why Facebook and Twitter, specially Twitter."
NEUT1|You know, I love Twitter even though I sold, my options will go higher.
NEUT2|In the weeks to come now, here is a bear case of those same stocks, because I want you to remember that.
NEUT3|The cues the whole market has the power to bring down all the stocks in the market, so we're going to just look at the queues.
NEUT4|Since we're basically talking about tech stocks.
NEUT5|So here's a four hour chart of the queues and let's just draw a simple trendline to go up and you could see how we bounce it off.
BEAR6|It's nice the bull case is still intact for the for the queues, but we you know, we kind of we got overextended.
NEUT7|So when we look in here, what do we see?
NEUT8|We see a bear flag trying to form and then at.
BEAR9|Means it's gonna go lower, possibly touched this trendline.
BULL10|Now I do think if we do get a chance and we touched his trendline, you possibly should buy, right.
NEUT11|Let's go ahead and look at Facebook now.
NEUT12|Alright, so you can see that same pattern in Facebook right?
NEUT13|Here is the you know, the leg down and you know, here's the kind of the flag you know.
NEUT14|So not looking that good.
NEUT15|So I told you why I like these stocks but you know this is a bear flag.
BULL16|OK so and the market is bear flagging so we have to keep that in mind that possibly the market might be able to pull this down.
NEUT17|Or maybe the stock itself pulls us down because guess what?
NEUT18|Man this is a.
NEUT19|Bear flag, so let's pull up Twitter and I'm going to show you why Twitter is the best of the bunch.
NEUT20|So we zoom in that little section right here and lock.
NEUT21|Look how the price came right back up there's no pole there's no flag I should say, right?
NEUT22|So you got the pole but there's really no flag.
BEAR23|Twitter totally rejected this sell off and it's sitting right at the high so I like Twitter the most now I got **** it out of my position on this downtrend right here.
NEUT24|I'm looking to get back in.
NEUT25|I'm hopefully Monday morning.
BEAR26|Maybe there's a big push down.
NEUT27|Brings Twitter down with it an.
NEUT28|That I can get long again.
NEUT29|What is Twitter waiting for?
NEUT30|I think it's waiting for that right there earnings.
BEAR31|So a lot of bad things in the news about Twitter right now.
NEUT32|How the accounts got hacked?
NEUT33|You know what?
NEUT34|Another thing that made me sell is like if it gets hacked again because it's a little early.
BEAR35|If it gets hacked again, that's going to be bad news, right?
NEUT36|That means Twitter has no control with a platform, so that's the reason why I got out.
BEAR37|But the stock says the price action says wrong move, get back in.
NEUT38|OK, so that's what I'm looking to do.
NEUT39|I told you in the other video that is nice bull case for Twitter, but this is a bear case of a bear case on Huawei.
NEUT40|Those same stocks that I talked about in the last video.
NEUT41|Might go down real quick before I go.
NEUT42|I don't want to last video.
NEUT43|I mentioned Google, you know we bring up the four hour chart.
NEUT44|Bear flag as well and I'm hoping that this doesn't come to flourish and alright, so don't forget subscribe like and don't forget to hit that Bell.
NEUT45|Check it out.
NEUT46|I'm live every day, damn near every day.
NEUT47|"Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday every day tray trays out."""
