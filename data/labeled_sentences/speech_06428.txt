BULL0|"""Alright guys, welcome back to pocket change."
NEUT1|I appreciate you guys stopping by my name is Anthony.
NEUT2|I want to jump into this chart real quick.
NEUT3|We're looking at tickle symbol BKCC and the name of the stock is BlackRock Capital Investments.
BEAR4|It's going for $2.70 right now right now and it was down negative 56.73%.
BEAR5|So what I'm seeing here is a curling up on the one year chart.
BULL6|Looks like it's crawling up pretty good.
BEAR7|For a high wage with a wedge pattern, another three months is down negative 45 on the one month is up 2.27 and on the one week.
BULL8|Break even an one day is up 3.03.
NEUT9|So what I'm looking at here is when I look at these numbers, I'm seeing possibly a good break.
NEUT10|Out pattern here, let's go to Weibel.
NEUT11|If you guys don't know, I keep a Weibull link in the description.
NEUT12|If you want to sign up for Weibull and get two free stocks, redeposit $100, it has a lot more features than Robin Hood does, so we're looking at the daily chart.
BULL13|And what we have here is some support at $1.40.
BULL14|Seven $1.47 after the Big drop, support it there and then it looks like it's supported here again at $1.75.
NEUT15|And it keeps popping up.
BULL16|So it looks like it's moving up.
BULL17|It looks like it's been trailing between these two resistance and support levels for awhile, and it looks like it's going to pop up to the top end.
NEUT18|While looking at these angles clickers on pop up to the top in when you look at the moving average.
NEUT19|So you swing traders.
NEUT20|Moving average could have been here that would have been your buy in.
NEUT21|It would have been cleaning all the way up and still moving.
NEUT22|So you swing.
BULL23|Traders have a good chance to still get in.
NEUT24|If you need to.
BULL25|If you want to that is, you know there's always a possibility for it to drop down to below, but this is looks like a strong sign for uptrend so just wanted to let you guys know that.
NEUT26|Make sure the light, as described in the bottom.
NEUT27|"If you like what you're hearing, I'll see you guys in the future."""
