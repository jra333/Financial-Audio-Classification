NEUT0|"""You know, in terms of broad reopening plays, I'm sure we'll talk about New Street High target on GE, out of Morgan Stanley, they go 13 to 17 Morgan Stanley on our parent."
NEUT1|Comcast goes to 65 Bull case 75.
BULL2|So the reopening enthusiasm is there.
BEAR3|But then Jimmy got a Disney which is closing 20% of their stores in North America by the end of the year.
BEAR4|So it's not uniform, will direct to consumer business really cut back a lot during this.
NEUT5|Which means that when things finally happen, it's going to be.
NEUT6|Wide open and you're going to see tremendous leverage in the model, but I David, when I think of Disney, I think of this Amazon deal for Thursday Night Football.
NEUT7|Possible deal possible, but we're not there yet.
BEAR8|You're right, but it's a big number.
NEUT9|We've been talking about that possibility for the worst case was to reiterate, I mean, Fox, NBC, CBS.
NEUT10|They're all and ABC.
NEUT11|Potentially they're all going to be there, but you'll add Amazon as well.
NEUT12|Potentially getting some individual games too.
NEUT13|It's exclusively.
BEAR14|It's going to cost them a lot of credit.
NEUT15|David Cord cutting, but these numbers that the NFL is getting?
NEUT16|Yeah, as if core doubling, not right, because it is as the universe shrinks, its the one thing you can still grab ahold of, yes?
BULL17|And and it's so you know, you know, in a way, Carl, it becomes more valuable, even though the ecosystem is in is in seminal decline.
BULL18|Yeah, amazing David.
NEUT19|I mean today, by the way, we should mention, Paramount Plus goes live.
NEUT20|Yes, watch to see how that's received.
NEUT21|And Jason Kilar of Warner Media.
NEUT22|David presenting at Morgan Stanley as it seems like the entire world is presented in Morgan Stanley this week says that they believe that in the future most households will have about 6 to 7 streaming services.
NEUT23|And of course.
NEUT24|AT&T believes they're going to have one of them.
NEUT25|Yeah, HBO Max, which has started to pick up in terms of momentum, but we're keeping a close eye on overall just what's going on at Warner.
NEUT26|Not that you know how much time will it.
NEUT27|Will they sit with that asset and continue to to to focus on growth?
NEUT28|Or what will happen?
NEUT29|You know, conceivably, over the next year or two, we could see a lot of tumbleton media.
NEUT30|But yeah, that's I don't know.
NEUT31|Six or seven.
NEUT32|I think I'm already there, Jim.
NEUT33|In terms of in terms of streaming services.
NEUT34|And that's already enough.
NEUT35|I mean, I don't.
NEUT36|You know, after awhile they've got, there's got to be a better search function somehow.
BEAR37|Maybe it's out of function and just wondering.
NEUT38|My button by Clicker David, we didn't talk about the TV, the NFL package, no Sunday this Sunday ticket, right?
NEUT39|Which is the most valuable thing on Earth?
NEUT40|Yes, if your fantasy football player.
