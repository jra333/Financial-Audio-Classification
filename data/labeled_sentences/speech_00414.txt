NEUT0|"""What are the things that we would like to point out another short list in the retail sector Lulu extremely overbought?"
NEUT1|We kept telling people every day, every MMT is aware of it, isn't that right?
NEUT2|Rick goalie?
BEAR3|That's right and we were forced to take the shorts with our overbought list and all of these overbought ones were taking all the risk out in the market maker platform said to sell short finally came down is starting to build some weakness.
NEUT4|Any upside volatility with earnings, any upside volatility, price action gap.
BEAR5|And pre market futures will be short like this every single time.
NEUT6|Why?
NEUT7|Because they are overbought people, so as the retail investor trader, sit there and watch them go down.
BEAR8|The SMF MMT is on the other side of that decline making that money and the bounces are narrow bounces up, sell short, bounces up so short consolidation in year couldn't take out the SMF teeny line.
NEUT9|Because it could not.
BEAR10|It's an overblowing overbought retail stock.
BULL11|"Extremely overbought with bears being squeezed all the way up over the last couple of months and then we finally said it's time for us to take a shot at it and we were right and that's the short on Lulu."""
