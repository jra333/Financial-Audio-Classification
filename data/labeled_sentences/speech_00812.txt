NEUT0|"""Back at it new video."
NEUT1|Again, I want to talk about these crypto stocks.
NEUT2|I think he's crypto stocks or you know, honestly, they obviously been going crazy as Bitcoin.
BULL3|Price continues to rise.
NEUT4|We're looking at.
NEUT5|This is what Bitcoin is.
NEUT6|1 Bitcoin right now.
NEUT7|So obviously these digital cryptocurrency stocks.
BEAR8|Are going absolutely crazy and the stock price of Bit Digital Inc has increased total 33% today.
NEUT9|If you look at the week it's put up 214% so this is an emerging Bitcoin mining company, ticker symbol, BT BT and one of the triggers for the stock price increase has to do with the demand for Bitcoin mining services.
NEUT10|Especially in the recent months ending 2020 and into 2021, for example, Coindesk pointed out that 47,000 bitcoins left Coinbase in the first two days of the year, and miners have just minted over 1700 Bitcoin.
BULL11|So due to overwhelming demand, the price of Bitcoin hit a new high.
BULL12|Therefore the demand for more Bitcoin miners.
NEUT13|So on December 21st, which is important news but digital announced the third quarter of the fiscal year 2020 that the revenue from the company's Bitcoin mining system was around $8 million, and that the number of Bitcoins earned from the Bitcoin mining business was about 739.51.
NEUT14|So big digital miners, their number was about 17,000 miners acquired in the third quarter of 2020 and from the nine months of 2020 the company announced revenue from the Bitcoin mining business was at 8.6 million, and then of course the third quarter of the fiscal year 2027.91 million.
NEUT15|So again.
BEAR16|Bit Digital's net loss from discontinued discontinued operations was 3.3 million for nine months in 2020 as they provided a full impairment on assets for discontinued peer to peer car rental business.
NEUT17|So I just really want to give a breakdown of why I think that cryptocurrency stocks are pretty volatile.
NEUT18|I think they're going to go up and down.
NEUT19|With Bitcoin and with other cryptocurrencies.
NEUT20|But with that being said, I think we've arrived at that time in that place in the cryptocurrency timeline of where.
NEUT21|It's here to stay, I think.
NEUT22|Again, just my opinion.
NEUT23|Please do your own research.
NEUT24|This is just my opinion, but.
NEUT25|I think these stocks that are.
NEUT26|I mean, if you look at this stock here, looking at for the month last three months.
NEUT27|You know, study, study, study, study, study never really dipped down to low study studies and then it made this jump.
NEUT28|Right, similarly to all you know, similar to the Bitcoin prices just recently really really been surging towards, you know.
NEUT29|The the fourth quarter of 2020.
NEUT30|So I just think you know stocks like this.
NEUT31|Can be on.
NEUT32|Very interesting to look at and something to keep an eye on moving forward.
NEUT33|As you know, Bitcoin price surges, so let me know in the comments what you guys think about bit digital stock again.
BULL34|Huge gains this past month in the past day.
NEUT35|A big time, so let me know in the comments you guys think Bitcoin price prediction bit digital Prescott price prediction?
