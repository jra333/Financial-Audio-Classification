BULL0|"""As aggressive as we've been on on the web, with charging for our core content, we feel that there are certain online only options like video and audio that really work best in the free space where you get the maximum audience and scale that you can."
NEUT1|Are you concerned that the clips will go into some sort of environments that you're not happy about, or have you seen any?
NEUT2|Or are there any anecdotes about where you've seen that show up and things that you've never did really expect?
NEUT3|It'll early on, or it's so pretty early because we've actually been.
NEUT4|Making the code that available for a few weeks or maybe a little bit more than that.
NEUT5|But we've been very interested to see how blogs and other third party sites are generally starting to pick up the code and about it and.
NEUT6|In terms of worrying about it, then misused straight.
NEUT7|So that's just part of the web.
NEUT8|I don't think that's gonna be that much.
NEUT9|Would issue for us and it's so far as that happens.
NEUT10|We want to be aware of it, but I don't think we're going to be policing every use of every video or just was eager for the traffic as anybody else is, so we won't be available with it as we can be.
NEUT11|Well, thank you on behalf of the bloggers, if I may say blog.
BULL12|Thanks for making like great video available.
NEUT13|We can all work together here, right?
NEUT14|So how are you guys?
NEUT15|Kind of getting the reporting?
NEUT16|Operation to be more digital or to use these tools.
BULL17|You know it's been a steady spend a steady climb to basically engage print staff in online on many different levels.
NEUT18|First it was getting them to provide documents or primary source emails and that kind of thing that would help.
NEUT19|Ran out a story on the website, then it became a matter of getting more of them to do columns or participate in forums.
NEUT20|More and more reporters are taking digital cameras with him and.
NEUT21|Uploading photos to our office here in New York so we can do a very nice photo galleries.
NEUT22|Then the next big hurdle was getting them to do more spot news basically to come around to understanding that the new cycles have tightened so much, especially in business news that the idea of holding a scoop for tomorrow morning's newspaper is almost impossible these days, and there's more and more important to break stories online.
NEUT23|And now here's our here's our next big Challenge, which is doing more video an you know as I said.
NEUT24|And as I tell people, not every story in the Journal needs or deserves a video.
NEUT25|In fact, really not that not that many of them do well.
NEUT26|I'm looking for a few good videos every day.
NEUT27|We are looking to have a video link with 3050 eighty stories a day, because, hey, we don't have the bandwidth.
NEUT28|Would be I don't think our readers have that much time.
NEUT29|"We want to make every video experience be as special as we can make it."""
