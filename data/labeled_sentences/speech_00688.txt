BULL0|"""Thanks for doing an Earth radio today."
NEUT1|We have digital asset news sharing Tesla's latest announcements that they are now accepting payments in Bitcoin.
NEUT2|If you like our summary videos, check out the Earth experiment at Earth to IO.
NEUT3|Remember when PayPal came out and they said they were going to offer Bitcoin Bitcoin cash like when Athyrium and there's a pretty big story then like 2-3 weeks later.
NEUT4|We had Elon Musk coming out and said yeah we're going to buy 1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin.
NEUT5|And I have to tell you, even I was a bit sceptical 'cause I thought it was just it was a pretty good, you know, play to do that type of thing.
NEUT6|I know Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy had really been in the news and talked about that at length and he actually talked to you on Musk about doing this, so I didn't really put much weight into it.
NEUT7|I thought at some point they would actually sell.
NEUT8|I don't Michael Saylor wouldn't sell, but here we are, with Elon Musk going.
NEUT9|Hey, you know what?
NEUT10|This is what the tweet says.
NEUT11|You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin that states here Teslas.
NEUT12|Using only internal and open source software, an operates Bitcoin nodes directly.
NEUT13|Bitcoin Ada Tessa will be retained as Bitcoin not converted to Fiat currency, so this is great.
NEUT14|Now people can't come to us and like, Oh yeah, that's good, but they're just going to put money.
NEUT15|No, they're going to keep into Bitcoin and I have said in the past and I know people have talked to me about this.
NEUT16|Like Rob, you understand the institutions are here.
NEUT17|They're never going to sell, and I'm like you know what, I know.
NEUT18|Michael Saylor is never going to sell, but the rest of people I'm not going to my faith into it so.
NEUT19|Now I can add you on must to one of those groups, who I think may not ever sell Bitcoin.
NEUT20|So he really does get it.
NEUT21|But what about all the other hedge funds?
NEUT22|Other big players, institutions, other manipulators and whales out there can't account for them.
NEUT23|So again, I really can't say what's going to happen in the future for the bear market, how long it's going to last, but I can just tell you this at some point.
NEUT24|What goes up must come down.
NEUT25|Things cannot go up forever, but enjoy the wins because this is.
BULL26|"A winner of a day."""
