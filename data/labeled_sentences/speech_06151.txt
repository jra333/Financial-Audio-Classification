NEUT5|If you feel like there's a ticker worth mentioning, OK so today I wanted to go over review.
BULL6|Request an LPC and this thing's been kind of grinding back up after a gap down and we're just getting new highs as we go.
NEUT7|Like about 50 days.
NEUT8|Highs we keep just testing him and breaking him.
NEUT9|I think 196 seems like a.
NEUT10|It's like a it's too much risk for me to like.
NEUT11|Try to take this tricky because I know the resistance that we have right now is around the 2:40 area an.
NEUT12|I would say the next resistance area or the neck like a potential target would be the 273 because that's where the gap of you know that's where the gap shot down at.
NEUT13|So.
BULL14|For me, I think we have some support from this gap right here, 'cause it didn't really want to come down.
NEUT15|Like it kinda close, but it didn't go back to its former ranges and try to few try to make new lows.
NEUT16|And then we did have some support like it just quickly you could see that the candle came down real quick.
BULL17|So we we definitely have some support there.
NEUT18|So I don't know if it's a good trade like to take in because.
BEAR19|Just that the support has like it's, it's to further down.
NEUT20|I think if someone were to take this trade.
NEUT21|They would have to hit that last area of resistance, which is like the 3:40.
NEUT22|'cause then you'd be making like $1.50 an from this gap, you're risking $0.40.
BULL23|You know we we have some resistance.
BULL24|I mean we have some support here.
NEUT25|'cause it doesn't seem like a.
BEAR26|The buyers aren't willing to let the price go any lower like lower than this because it just got bought up with all these weeks right here.
NEUT27|So let me see.
NEUT28|Yeah, that's basically it.
NEUT29|That's what I would say about this chart.
