NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some Contacts there, but very very impressive movement on this one.
NEUT5|I mean, you're talking about the fact that during that opening 30 minutes the price was all the way down there, but the price was then all ultimately able to bounce and close all the way back up there.
BULL6|Very nice move, but this does bring about the more than valid question of yeah, great move.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of genuine power behind it?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of true strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
BEAR11|In that area is down there at 122.
NEUT12|Why's that level important?
NEUT13|I'm not saying at all this is what's going to happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here to 122 behaves in that manner.
NEUT14|Then start to work to itself back upwards.
NEUT15|Now what would you have in this situation?
NEUT16|Well, you'd have a set of those there and you'd have settles down there, which if you envision those stair steps, hey, you'd have.
NEUT17|The price making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
NEUT18|That's what it truly strong movies going to.
BEAR19|It's going to make progress, but on the other side of things, what if the price came down here?
NEUT20|Behave in that manner, then continued on down.
NEUT21|Not one would you have?
NEUT22|Well, you would have the price having gone quite literally right back to where it was.
NEUT23|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sign a true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT24|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but that is why in my opinion that 122 mark very, very important level 'cause it's going to show us whether or not the price is quote unquote, making progress, which again, is bullish.
NEUT25|Or is the price quote unquote going back to where it was again associated with being bearish as far as levels of resistance are concerned?
NEUT26|It's all about that purple and right there.
NEUT27|The 50.
NEUT28|Moving average current value of that as well.
NEUT29|Call it right around the 127 mark, but anyway, look at it.
NEUT30|Very impressive bounce today, not just a question of can the price build upon this bonds and momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT33|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR37|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
