NEUT0|"""But you know, options traders are betting disease."
NEUT1|Magical Rally is about to run out of steam than what you see.
BULL2|And a day like today, with this stock almost got back to its 52 week high, but it might have done intraday above 115.
NEUT3|Call volume was really hot.
NEUT4|It was few times out of puts and total options.
NEUT5|Volume was three times average daily volume.
BEAR6|The most active strike that I saw was the September 120 calls.
NEUT7|A little more than 8000 of those traded for an average price about 1:40 that looked to be selling.
NEUT8|It looked like someone had this position in place.
BULL9|You get this pop above 115 to new highs and they're taking some profits here.
BULL10|That doesn't mean that the run is over, but it's had a really nice run.
NEUT11|Over the last couple of months, the company is going to report on August 7th I believe.
NEUT12|I think the options market between now and then is implying about a 5% move in either direction, which seems kind of Fair.
NEUT13|That is that one year chart right there.
NEUT14|There's obviously some resistance up there at the prior highs we have a five year chart, which this is the most important one to me for probably technicians.
NEUT15|I'm a bit of a novice here, but look at that thing.
BEAR16|It just broke out above that downtrend that's been in place since those highs.
NEUT17|I think it was about 122 back in 2015 guys.
NEUT18|Sure yeah.
NEUT19|I think the interesting thing is if you go back and you look at the last week and a half or so and Disney.
NEUT20|Even wherever the stock has been, it's obviously been running higher and higher, but they have been very aggressively positioning for a move to the upside, and it was the 111 strikes and now they went all the way out to October like a week ago.
NEUT21|The 1:15 so people are expecting the stock to go higher now is 120.
BULL22|The cap maybe, but there's been very, very aggressive.
BULL23|Buying in between the levels between 1:10 all in 120 is interesting because it's right near that prior all time high, which will be significant absolutely.
