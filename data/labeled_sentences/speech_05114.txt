NEUT0|"""Here we RMMTS."
NEUT1|This is the great one that we trade every day, all day that matter.
BEAR2|But Netflix today had a breakout scheuch here but we got a good 1234 almost five teenies at what is a teeny in our pricing and the empty platform that's $0.56 per line.
NEUT3|Yeah, and yes, it's accurate.
NEUT4|You're right and we come down and we test that teeny line.
NEUT5|But then it's this broader.
NEUT6|I'm coming up to the top coming back, but then testing it.
NEUT7|But look at where it really broke out.
BEAR8|It took out the tops.
NEUT9|I give em empties and eight plus to that top shot that thing right there.
BEAR10|That's a $4 breakout.
NEUT11|There's only 40 minutes left.
NEUT12|Once again it was a longer term.
BEAR13|Bottom diamonds were popping.
NEUT14|Look at the diamonds were holding support.
NEUT15|Look at that Diamond pop diamond pop.
NEUT16|Then the Diamond State elevated above that half Diamond bar with the Diamond Pop, a diamond pop.
NEUT17|But we got up here.
NEUT18|And here's the key.
NEUT19|It sold into it and you got below that Diamond and the diamond started to go down and they got support and out you go and it's just that fun and it's just that easy to go with directional price movement MMT's I get my teenies up in my teeny reversals but then late in the day through this period of time.
NEUT20|Right here to that, break out when it took out these tops right here.
NEUT21|This is what we call a triple top, but our make up our market maker platform told us that in that bar we had to take it and we did it.
NEUT22|You did it by identifying it by identifying those three diamonds there and then the diamond pop.
NEUT23|That meant that these big up bars are the mandatory qualifiers that you want to see 1/2 teeny bars.
NEUT24|And two teeny bars, but those two teeny lines and then three minute bars.
NEUT25|56 * 56 with fifteen 50s.
NEUT26|A dollar to sell to Dollar 12.
NEUT27|And these are how price action works.
NEUT28|High frequency volume machines are involved in the tape.
NEUT29|Lots of things were being bought above the market.
NEUT30|There's lots of tricks and gimmicks that go involved to get these moves.
NEUT31|"Then they fell in that direction and that to the Netflix trade."""
