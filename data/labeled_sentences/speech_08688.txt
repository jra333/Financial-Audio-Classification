NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clear in this via video chart."
NEUT1|Ticker symbol AAPL Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Will a pretty crazy way to start off the week gap up and then the 1st 30 minutes you can see right there after the gap up price pulled back quite a bit and then I'll send to recover nicely and is now slowly grinding its way back upwards so more of the story let eyeballs going to be watching this one here headed into Tuesday.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price can continue to stay up above 113.
NEUT8|Now.
BEAR9|Don't get me wrong if the price falls below 113, that does not mean that the overall chart is all of a sudden completely destroyed or anything like that.
BULL10|Yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and assuming you care bout more so the grand scheme of it all vanished with the purple line.
NEUT12|Here comes into play, the well known and famous 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average, as the name implies, this line here is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful in terms of gauging the health of the move.
NEUT14|What do I mean while the move being from these lows up to where the price currently is, meaning that from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price stays above that purple line as the line itself moves higher and higher.
BULL15|And the Bulls are in full health.
NEUT16|The Bulls are in full control, having us visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT17|Sure, stand above 113 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT18|Let me squeeze on the charter a little bit off a bit more context.
NEUT19|Next, key level that many, many breakout players going to be watching moving forward, going to be right up there at.
NEUT20|The one 1525 marks of one 1525 near term area of resistance and then after that really nothing until up around 1:18.
NEUT21|But let's just take it one resistance level at a time and 1st if the price can break up through there.
NEUT22|But All in all very nice way to start off the week.
NEUT23|Let's see how things continue to play out.
NEUT24|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT26|But it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL28|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT33|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
