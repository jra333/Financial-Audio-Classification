NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Daniel sent today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about Jill is science and it is a third video.
BEAR2|I will leave links in the description down below for the first two and here you can see the chart and Gillette Sciences drop down for 33% like I predicted because last video was somewhere here and I said that it is only hyper because of global situation problem.
NEUT3|But now I'm thinking that this stock are close to fair value.
NEUT4|October 28, 2020.
NEUT5|Angela Science is unknown.
BULL6|So fourth quarter 2020 dividend zero point, $68 per share and we can see third quarter results.
BULL7|Gap dilutive to EPS of Zero Point.
NEUT8|$29.00 per share.
NEUT9|They're paying like 200%.
BULL10|In payout rate, right now product sales increased 18% to $6.5 billion and product sales excluding Valerie Valerie.
BULL11|It is AMD severe, increased 2% to 5.6 billion.
NEUT12|And now you know the trend is Vera.
BULL13|Bring around $900 million in every venue in 1/4 and I think that fact is awesome.
NEUT14|And the third news that they complete Immunomedics acquisition.
BULL15|And it is a good thing too.
NEUT16|And the whole things bring us to this situation.
NEUT17|An now Julie Science costs only $58.
NEUT18|I think it extremely cheap.
BULL19|Plus if you like technical analysis, you can see that we're close to some kind of support line here on gurufocus, so you can see a good focus so well.
NEUT20|You and I think fair price around 75 it is.
BULL21|OK, and now we have 58 and I think the price can go down a little bit easily.
NEUT22|I think it will be a good idea to check this stock every day and if you will see something like.
NEUT23|I reversal like is this one or this one?
NEUT24|It can be a really good time to buy and they will draw you as a chart where I will buy like 100% and I think I will buy in this scenario.
NEUT25|First.
BULL26|I really hope that they will pass this line.
NEUT27|Then they will trade somehow and then they will come to this line again and.
NEUT28|I will see they close, so over this line and I will probably buy it here with very nice upside 56% and stop around 8%.
BULL29|I think it will be a really good trait.
