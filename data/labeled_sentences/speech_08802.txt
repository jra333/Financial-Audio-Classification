NEUT0|"""Jordan from LA Jordan."
NEUT1|I love you and miss you Tom also request this ones is AMD.
NEUT2|Paul tells about this company.
NEUT3|We talk about AMD before so pillar number one is PE ratio.
NEUT4|Want this lesson 20 I can see it's pretty bad pool the PE ratio is 125 so this is already showing six times more now getting keep in mind if you divide by 6 times you're 13 times PE price to sales I mean becomes 2.1 or something like that entails.
BULL5|Was 2.8 pillar #2 is profit margin.
NEUT6|How they doing profit margin here?
NEUT7|14% so we had a check mark here.
BULL8|Revenue growth over the past five years, four billion, 4.35 point, 256.56 point.
BEAR9|7 checkmark pillar #4, which is profit growth, bone loss.
BEAR10|660 lost.
NEUT11|500 Los 33 made.
NEUT12|337 made 341 making money ball.
NEUT13|I will give him credit.
NEUT14|But look how long they lost money for phone number 5 is number of shares.
NEUT15|Oh boy 73835 ninety 292.
NEUT16|They love issuing more shares.
NEUT17|Boy let's do current assets greater than current liabilities is Pillar #6 maybe.
NEUT18|5.5 billion in current assets.
NEUT19|Current liabilities 2.4 excellent and I will say this guys they only have $3 billion in total liabilities, so 5.5 greater than 3.15.
NEUT20|They have about $2.3 billion left over.
NEUT21|So you can take their $110 billion market cap and take 2% off that.
BULL22|Congratulations, it's still a very positive thing.
NEUT23|It's hard for companies to go under when they have more cash on hand than liabilities, which is a great thing.
NEUT24|That's a major check mark.
BULL25|I love it free cash flow.
NEUT26|Random also 4,000,000.
BEAR27|This is bad.
NEUT28|I mean they have no freaking have one.
NEUT29|You have one year free cash flow before this year it's go to their trailing 12 months.
NEUT30|How much money they make him free cash flow.
NEUT31|They were $110 billion business.
BULL32|Zeros oh, keep going and they made 700,000,000 in free cash flow South to that ratio for me real quick.
NEUT33|So 157.411 fifty seven point one 157 so their price to free cash flow is 160.
NEUT34|We want it to be less than 21 to be less than 20.
NEUT35|Every dollar free cash flow.
NEUT36|You gotta pay $160 to get so if you give me $160.00 today every year I'll give you a dollar back.
NEUT37|Good investment or bad now are they growing a lot?
NEUT38|We sat there going.
NEUT39|Are they going there than in Camelot?
NEUT40|Yes, the revenue is doubled in five years, but remember guys just 'cause if this?
BULL41|If the free cash flow doubled again from here, you're still only at 80 bucks.
NEUT42|Any times free cash flow double again 40 double again.
NEUT43|Now you're at 20.
BULL44|This is going to go up 8 times your profit.
BULL45|"The free cash flow has to go 8 times for them to get there."""
