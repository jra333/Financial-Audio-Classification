NEUT0|"""Here's the opening Bell guys in the S&P at the bottom of your screen will see if we get any more movement as the SNP."
NEUT1|Thanks, Ryan Detrick has moved basically 20 basis points a day for the past three days.
NEUT2|Haven't really seen that since 2019.
BULL3|Jim, you mentioned the chip shortage and looks like we are going to get some kind of executive order from the White House in the coming weeks.
NEUT4|This letter from the industry to the White House signed by Lisa Su, an Intel and Micron and Qualcomm pointing out that.
NEUT5|You know the US share of manufacturing and chips has gone from the high 30s to the teens in about 20 years.
NEUT6|20-30 years.
NEUT7|Yeah, look, this is you'll see again Lam Kelly Tencor Applied Materials reports next week.
BEAR8|They will be running because of this lease.
NEUT9|Assume remarkable job.
NEUT10|We recommend the stock at 5:00 or AMD when she told me that I didn't know what I was talking about.
NEUT11|I always love that, especially when they're right.
NEUT12|But you look at these companies.
BEAR13|Large companies are indeed hostage.
NEUT14|I always like to point out Sky Work solutions, not hostage.
NEUT15|Why because they felt that they should be foundry heavy.
NEUT16|Not found the light.
NEUT17|Intel used to be foundry heavy that when Intel decided to go to President Trump last year, they went kind of on their own, saying listen, we want to do this and its defense an it was an ill advised way to do it.
BULL18|They should have done it in a group and they've got a real champion here.
NEUT19|In general, Rimando she's not approved yet.
NEUT20|That's the problem.
NEUT21|She's to Commerce secretary.
NEUT22|She I think is going along David.
NEUT23|I know you're not going to hit you with my 50 year chip Bond and I'm not talking burrito.
NEUT24|Listen, I again.
NEUT25|I don't know that you're going to ever get your 50 year bond as much as you want it, but maybe it will happen.
NEUT26|Freeman, but I think more importantly the focus and there was press on this yesterday as we're pointing out having some sort of national strategy for CHIP.
NEUT27|Yes, it will come back to you.
NEUT28|Don't worry, we will always about me.
NEUT29|That's why we will all be very thankful for you so that when we all have chips everywhere, I like Doritos personally, but I'll take anything.
BULL30|I got the new Spicy ranch to unbelievably my house list.
NEUT31|Yeah, and you can.
NEUT32|You can have more.
NEUT33|You know, you gotta have more than one.
NEUT34|I mean, once you have one, you're done.
NEUT35|But yeah, back to the actual chips were talking bout.
NEUT36|This is really important and a lot of people actually are still focused on Intel.
NEUT37|Strangely enough Jim.
NEUT38|I know you're not a big fan.
NEUT39|Even now we had dealt with being a beneficiary of what could end up being some sort of national strategy here, given it is still the leader by far and manufacturing chips in this country, right?
NEUT40|And will there be actual?
NEUT41|Will there be money behind it from the US cover?
NEUT42|Well, that's why you need to bond because otherwise no.
NEUT43|Now by the way, the seminar companies would make this really clear.
NEUT44|Call me doctor companies.
NEUT45|Yes, they're saying good things, but they like to make things where things are cheaper.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
