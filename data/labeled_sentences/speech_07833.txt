BULL0|"""Welcome back and thank you for watching."
NEUT1|This is another stock analysis video with an I'll see capital.com.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to be looking at Wells Fargo ticker symbol WFC, and we're going to be talking about the short to medium term, trend and ways of trading it.
NEUT3|To start, we're going to be looking at this this uptrend that was broken a few weeks ago.
NEUT4|About a month ago.
BULL5|Actually, an Wells Fargo is actually trading very nicely.
BULL6|It was in a nice trend.
NEUT7|OK, isn't this nice channel trading very much like our Citigroup Traite broke beneath it?
BULL8|OK, and now it consolidated, traded higher into earnings and now it hasn't done much.
NEUT9|It hasn't gone anywhere actually, after earnings.
NEUT10|In fact, it developed this resistance line.
BEAR11|That is something we don't like seeing.
NEUT12|OK, looking at the weekly chart, you can see that Channel better and then you can see its resistance line.
NEUT13|Another way of looking at this is a consolidation.
NEUT14|As seen here.
BEAR15|OK so that it's a consolidation period, but we think Wells Fargo is going to break lower.
NEUT16|Here's another look at that Channel.
NEUT17|I'm just going to remove this 'cause we're going to look at the shorter term trend now so.
NEUT18|Bring up the 20 day 30 minute chart.
NEUT19|We can see this.
BEAR20|No, this downtrend developing sell off on earnings on big volume.
NEUT21|Looking at this that uptrend again.
BEAR22|I'm still stuck on that Channel tool.
BEAR23|I'm sorry bout that.
NEUT24|You have this, you know this uptrend here.
NEUT25|That was recently broken.
NEUT26|My computer can unfreeze.
NEUT27|OK. You had a nice uptrend that was broken, so you have that resistance now in the shorter term time frame you have a resistance line that that was broken.
BULL28|OK, after earnings have found support within the support line trade, hyeran broke through that support line.
NEUT29|OK, this happened on.
BEAR30|On Thursday and then traded sideways on Friday.
NEUT31|Again, you gotta be careful with some of these these charts with summer because there is like trading volume.
NEUT32|Some of this, some of the technicals have to be taken very lightly, but we don't like this chart, we think.
BEAR33|Wells Fargo is going to be heading down in the short term price.
NEUT34|He moved down to the $47 level prior to hire, maybe 4750 that more appropriate back into the support area.
NEUT35|You have a gap there that hasn't technically been closed.
BULL36|You have this support.
BEAR37|You have support here in here, so this is the strong support level at 4740, so you probably can't see a move there.
