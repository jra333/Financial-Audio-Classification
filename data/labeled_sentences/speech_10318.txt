BULL0|"""We're looking at another market open higher."
NEUT1|What do you think it means?
NEUT2|Well, first we got to see which part of the market opens higher.
NEUT3|I mean, yesterday at around 4:00 to 5:00 AM it was all Microsoft and it was all Alphabet and Amazon.
NEUT4|That group quickly faded and we had this move into value orchestrated by JP Morgan piece that a lot of people were talking about saying that value is was just a ready, ready to spoil spring and we have more people today recommending BP and Royal Dutch.
NEUT5|I mean give me a break.
NEUT6|Growth is always going to be paramount in the time of covid.
NEUT7|If there were no covid then we would be able to say yes.
NEUT8|Values out of wack, but we've got a bunch of companies that reported good numbers that are valued, but that's not going to change the that's not gonna change this, but Jimmy.
NEUT9|These futures moving as a function of the election, which is to say, is this a A?
NEUT10|Is this signaling a Biden win and people feel like we're going to get an answer quickly?
NEUT11|They do.
NEUT12|They think it's a Trump win?
NEUT13|What?
NEUT14|What is this?
NEUT15|I think that it's the latter part of what you said about bye.
NEUT16|That they were going to get an answer quickly.
NEUT17|Not sure it's going to go, but I think a lot of people want to get ahead of that.
NEUT18|I think that no matter who wins, you have a quick dip and you have to buy.
NEUT19|I know that sounds simplistic, but the market is simplistic.
NEUT20|We always try to make the market as if it's some sort of Einsteinian philosophy.
NEUT21|I mean what it really is is, are we finally done with this nonsense?
NEUT22|And we start focusing on earnings again, and when we do that and then, well, then people want to buy.
NEUT23|So right now people are getting ahead of that.
NEUT24|I don't know.
NEUT25|I think it's so fatuous, but it's Andrew.
NEUT26|It's what's going to happen.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
