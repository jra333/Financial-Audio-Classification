NEUT0|"""Skinny Weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 31st of December 2020.
NEUT2|First 850 after week and it's the end of the year.
NEUT3|So happy New Year to you were #8 cardono of the ticker ADA what's up Charles Hoskinson for Corono against BTC?
NEUT4|Yeah, this is the master plan of Cardano.
NEUT5|Our hope is that Cardano does a sideways move over here we go sideways in this range, right?
NEUT6|In this particular range we keep ranging in this between the resistance and support and we just keep accumulating here.
NEUT7|Accumulate, accumulate, accumulate, accumulate, and as things get tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and suddenly problem, we start exploding towards the upside for Cardano, hopefully that happens, but then again it is all.
NEUT8|Out of our control, hopefully we see another sideways move, something like this, right?
NEUT9|Coming for Corono over here we don't know for sure whether it's going to be the case, so it's just nothing much that we can do except to be patient and wait for the Corona will still do their thing.
NEUT10|You can see that when Corona falls there's always bounces.
NEUT11|Look at these bounds.
BULL12|Quite a big bounce actually.
BEAR13|Had it coming for Cardano 63%, yeah, but of course we drop lower itself, but you can see that there is.
NEUT14|There is some intent to push the price higher.
NEUT15|You see the intent over here and so hopefully he will see the return of their intent somewhere along the way, right?
NEUT16|Somewhere down the line.
NEUT17|Hopefully we see this sort of an intent, right?
NEUT18|Again, we do not want to enter into Carano prematurely because we still don't know how much longer this accumulation phase is going to take.
NEUT19|Eventually, when Carano takes off here, this is going to really look like pancakes.
NEUT20|Sure, how this might look quite big if you zoom in.
BEAR21|With a I'm just going to assume we've got 80% down.
BULL22|We've see potentially could be like siren 70%, yeah, so hopefully you know we get away D. And we get a wave here and pump sayonara.
NEUT23|We're just say we don't come back down for Cardano, hopefully that happens, but at this point of time you're going to have to be very careful about rushing into a trade for Cardano, right?
NEUT24|Let's move on, do it against USD T. But before that please give this video a like if enjoyed it.
NEUT25|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about Carolyn documents.
NEUT26|Be low.
BULL27|For Karen against USD T could we go higher?
NEUT28|Sure, however, there's already a double bearish divergance, right?
BULL29|Marginally higher high on the price marginally.
BULL30|Yeah bye.
BEAR31|So lower high on the Monday, lower high on the RSI, double bearish divergences, which means potentially things could be reversing adopted.
NEUT32|I doubt it.
BULL33|I think we could squeeze out a little bit more.
NEUT34|Breaking $0.20 first before dropping over, and if that were to happen, we might get an ending 5th diagonal right?
NEUT35|So and this could end up in a.
BEAR36|Triple bearish divergance write a series of lower highs on the mic.
NEUT37|Deanna series of lower highs on the RSI but higher highs under price, so you're going to be very very careful.
NEUT38|I don't know if a Cardano could push on any longer without properly correcting, yeah, But if we continue accumulating and rise and accumulating and rice, then yes, Cortana could still go much higher.
NEUT39|We could even go up to $0.30 if that happens, but then again we still need to correct right?
NEUT40|We can be just.
BULL41|You know, slowly moving higher and so as long just look at this clip long as we are above the pink, the trend will remain bullish for Cardano, yes.
NEUT42|So yeah, there we go.
NEUT43|This might take for Kino stay safe, don't do anything.
NEUT44|I wouldn't do.
BULL45|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL46|Hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT47|"I shall see you in the next video."""
