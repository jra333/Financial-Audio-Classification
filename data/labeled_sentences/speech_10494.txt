NEUT0|"""How do you explain today's incredible action with the Dow surging 555 points?"
BULL1|He soared 1.78%.
BEAR2|NASDAQ pulling 1.5%.
NEUT3|Wasn't the election supposed to freak people out?
NEUT4|But the opposite happened.
BEAR5|We ended up with a bizarrely bullish session for both the Biden stocks in the Trump stocks rallied.
NEUT6|Obviously, both Kennedys can't win, right?
NEUT7|So what drives this kind of counterintuitive move?
BEAR8|First off, at the most rancorous campaign in my lifetime, people are just literally.
NEUT9|This could be over.
BEAR10|The contest itself is taking a real toll on business, though soon that's over two I spent his hands of CEOs and money managers off on camera.
NEUT11|They can't be sure of their next move until they find out who the President Kennedy, and none of them have been able to articulate why it matters so much.
NEUT12|The big differences between Trump and Biden are on social issues, not economic ones.
NEUT13|I think for these CEOs, the end of the campaign means the end of the viciousness, end of the embarrassment, end of the anger Trump hate him, or like him.
BEAR14|He is the most deliberately polarizing candidate I can remember.
NEUT15|He does make Nixon look like a bit of a choirboy, something that clearly appeals to a lot of people.
NEUT16|That's OK once the race is finally over, there's an assumption that maybe some of the tension we dialed back, regardless of who wins.
NEUT17|In other words, maybe America can finally chill out, starting tomorrow, or at least this week.
BULL18|Second, there's a newfound and perhaps naive consensus that our democracy is stronger than partisan rancor.
NEUT19|Wouldn't that be something?
BULL20|Meaning we may actually have an orderly transfer of power.
NEUT21|If Joe Biden wins, or if you want to be more cynical, a lot of buyers believe Biden will win so decisively that will be able to call the race early and go to bed.
NEUT22|By midnight.
NEUT23|I, on the other hand, have no idea whatsoever what will occur and have said over and over and over again since 2016.
NEUT24|You have to base your investment decisions on the hand you've been given.
NEUT25|Not the one you anticipate when it comes to presidential elections.
NEUT26|Third, most important, this market Kimber, because it's already been bent, spindled and mutilated.
BEAR27|Last week we got hit with a more than 5% decline and that weakness was heavily concentrated in the big winners, including the ones who just reported fantastic quarters.
BEAR28|Very depressing for growth investors.
