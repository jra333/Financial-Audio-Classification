NEUT0|"""Hi guys, welcome to another episode of the aspiring entrepreneur."
NEUT1|I'm your host.
NEUT2|Humza Chowdhry and welcome to one of our newly one minute recap thing that we just launched.
NEUT3|I'm excited for you guys to be a part of this and my whole goal in this video is to recap the stock.
NEUT4|Today we're going to be covering Apple and under a minute and giving you the information that I think is valuable technical indicators and my thoughts for you know what you should do.
NEUT5|If you hold Apple stock, it's obviously one of the stocks that we care about the most on this channel.
NEUT6|So with that said, let's just jump right into it.
NEUT7|Start this timer here.
BEAR8|So what we saw was a massive sell off on Friday.
NEUT9|We had a huge volume bar here at open where people were pushing the stock down an we first got an initial squeeze and what was interesting was I had predicted sort of free market Friday that we would see about a 107 fifty bounce and you can see as soon as we traded underneath 108 towards the last hour of trading we had this massive push and you can see the volume here.
NEUT10|Where were the buyers?
NEUT11|Were the buyers for Apple right?
NEUT12|So it hit under 108.
BULL13|The buyers came in and they totally push this thing up above the SMAD line we actually crossed above and closed above the ** Mainline, which is great.
NEUT14|So my prediction is we sold off early and since September and we had Windows three, we bounced and hit 105 and then you can see this Anchorage VWAP is respected at 107.
NEUT15|Eighty and now this one 1260 line that we've used.
NEUT16|His previous support is going to be resistance line.
NEUT17|So we're going to have that and you can see two we closed on the down channel of the the Bollinger Band.
BULL18|So with that said, guys, best of luck and I expect this thing to rebound back into the 110.
BULL19|"Thank you."""
