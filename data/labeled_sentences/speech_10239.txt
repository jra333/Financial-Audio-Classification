BEAR4|It was a bit more of a mixed quarter.
NEUT5|It's a different business obviously than Apple, Apple, different business than Amazon.
NEUT6|Amazon in different businesses.
NEUT7|Facebook yeah.
NEUT8|Look, I mean look alphabet is totally beholden advertising.
BEAR9|If Ruth had reported hadn't talked about how the last seven weeks were good, that stock could be down substantially.
NEUT10|Brian Olsavsky is a unheralded hero.
NEUT11|He's the CFO of Amazon and what he does is lay out the fact that basically.
NEUT12|They're spending all this money on trying to keep workers safe.
NEUT13|What they didn't realize was that the whole country, if not the whole world, is going to.
NEUT14|Amazon is a very humble call.
BULL15|Humility there's amazing.
NEUT16|Facebook was all about small, medium sized business.
NEUT17|Everybody decided it was about whether Verizon was going to advertise tonight again, no intellectual rigor know.
