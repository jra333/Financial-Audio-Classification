BULL0|"""Welcome to FT markets Italy is growing again after a war like recession, with the economy expanding by North Point 3% in the first quarter."
NEUT1|But can Mateo Renzi, Italy's young Prime Minister and former mayor of Florence?
NEUT2|Learn lessons from his Old Town and turn this into a new Italian Renaissance.
NEUT3|Discussing this with me today is Regis Parents a Co head of European economics of an paribar.
NEUT4|Riggi, let's have a look at the charts which you brought with you and the first one shows the jump in private consumption and confidence real confidence which has happened over the last few years.
NEUT5|Really can you tell us a little bit through this?
BULL6|Yes, I think it's a very encouraging sign.
BULL7|We see an improvement in confidence across retailers, but also consumers.
BULL8|And this is both well for the outlook in the near term.
NEUT9|I think it's fair to say Italy's exit.
BULL10|Finally, the recession and we expect GDP to turn policy this year.
BULL11|We donated growth of around zero point 7% that accelerate even further in 2016, where we think probably growth rate of 1.3% and is this down to the actions of the European Central Bank or because of oil prices falling, putting more money into consumers pockets.
NEUT12|It's a combination of factors, so certainly certain factors are more supportive.
BULL13|You mentioned lower oil prices.
NEUT14|Also the weaker currency, but there are lot of country specific factors as well.
NEUT15|Out mentioned first teacher monitoring financial conditions.
NEUT16|The interesting thing is that the measures undertaken by the ECB so far it's only an impact on government bond yields.
BEAR17|But recently finally we see a significant falling interest rates on loans to the private sector.
BULL18|So essentially the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is working more effectively and this shows up in increasing new credit bearing college.
NEUT19|But it's quite a long way.
NEUT20|There's quite a long way to go for Italy.
NEUT21|Let's have a look at the second chart, which shows the comparison between Italy and Spain and neighboring country.
NEUT22|Since 2000, but it's quite a dramatic difference, isn't it very dramatic?
BEAR23|I mean Italy, Italian GDP fell by around 10% from its progressive speak more Despain, but also it was not growing before and essentially now is something below the levels in 2000.
BEAR24|So Italy's got a chronic problem of low growth, right?
BEAR25|Have a look at the third chart which you brought with you and that's looking at another problem for Italy.
NEUT26|This is core inflation.
BEAR27|Which is coming down steeply.
BULL28|This has major repercussions for Italy's debt, which as we know is huge, absolutely very good point.
NEUT29|I mean, it's interesting your code inflation on average between 97213 was around 2%.
BEAR30|So in line with the target and now it's fallen quite dramatically.
BEAR31|I think this shows that there was a supply problem in the past, but now demand problems are more evident and we sold so significant declining expectations.
BULL32|Now this is good news in a way because it helps improving Italy.
NEUT33|Effectiveness on the price level, but as you say, embedded important risk, it makes more difficult.
NEUT34|The public that adjustment now.
NEUT35|And given what's happening in Greece, should we be worried about the debt dynamics of Italy and about the sustainability of its that we think the Fed impact on Greece and Eurozone is going to be contained?
NEUT36|After all, I mean, the economy doesn't say all these.
BULL37|You know there is a recovery underway, and I think there is an important safety net.
NEUT38|This bit might step in.
BULL39|In order to prevent significant spillover effect, thank you very much Reggie for being with us today.
BULL40|So with Matteo Renzi and Mario Draghi, Italy is growing again.
NEUT41|"But it's still too early to say that this is turning into a real Italian Renaissance."""
