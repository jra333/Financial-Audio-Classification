NEUT0|"""Now let's welcome Stephanie Miller, managing Director of fiscal note markets and Brian Gardner, Chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel."
NEUT1|Welcome to both of you, Stephanie, let me begin with you.
NEUT2|What are the odds that the president gets not all of what he wants, but even most of what he wants?
NEUT3|And what are the odds that he's going to be able to pay for it in some form by raising taxes?
NEUT4|High, low, middle?
NEUT5|Yeah, well, I mean I think he's going to get a lot of what he wants, or none of what he wants.
NEUT6|And I I do think a lot of what's out today.
NEUT7|The paper that we've seen so far, whatever he announces should stick mostly to that.
NEUT8|Today.
NEUT9|It in some ways, really is the starting gun of a long process that will involve negotiations.
NEUT10|Who he's negotiating with, whether moderate Democrats are actually Republicans will shape where this is headed.
NEUT11|But at this point, it really seems like Democrats are planning to do this on their own and.
NEUT12|So if that's the case, then they can probably get a little bit more closer to what Biden actually wants.
NEUT13|Then if they brought Republicans in, but probably not that close.
BEAR14|The corporate tax rate, for example Joe Manchin, you know unneeded Democratic Senate vote has said he doesn't want to go above 25%, so already Democrats are negotiating with themselves.
BULL15|Well, the the proposed Brian corporate rate here would be, I think 28% up from 21% today, so there obviously is some wiggle room there.
NEUT16|Those numbers can be moved a little bit.
NEUT17|On a sliding scale, one way or another, do you think any Republicans would vote with President Biden and the Democrats on on what you see as the bill right now?
NEUT18|Or the package right now, including tax hikes, depending on how they move it through Congress, Tyler.
BEAR19|I think that if they're if they're separate but kind of Co joined in some way on the tax package, no, I mean, Republicans may be in disarray and fractured, but.
NEUT20|There is one principle that unites Republicans which is opposition to tax increase, so I don't see any Republican, especially those who voted for the 2017 Trump tax cuts that they're going to reverse course an brace taxes that to me that's that's a non starter on the spent on the spending side.
BEAR21|The infrastructure built there is bipartisan support conceptually, but funding and priorities are going to tear the two parties apart.
NEUT22|I think the majority the Republican leader is already indicated.
NEUT23|He's not probably not going to be on board.
BULL24|They might be able to get a couple of Republicans.
NEUT25|Can they get to 10 and then get around a filibuster?
NEUT26|Probably not, so that means they're going to go do reconciliation and do a party line.
NEUT27|Go it alone.
NEUT28|As as Stephanie alluded to, and so that probably tilted more towards what the president is kind of outlined.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
