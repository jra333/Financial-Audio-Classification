NEUT0|"""Hi, this is David Keener with Basecamp trading and look at Amazon today."
BULL1|Up over 1 1/2 percent late last week I was mentioning Amazon was moving higher breaking above this previous high.
NEUT2|Starting to fill the gap and then I said just looking at the strength of this change in momentum, the slope of this mood, daily momentum line.
BULL3|And here's all this strength in the hourly momentum.
NEUT4|I said that the target on Amazon was 844, while today will call that pretty darn close at 8:43.
BULL5|If we break eat 44 were easily going to 8:50, then we'll have to re evaluate the strength of the momentum, but Ezeli, continuing to move up $10 at a time.
BULL6|Keep in mind Amazon Andon is riding on the coattails of the NASDAQ, all moving to new highs.
NEUT7|I like Amazon to 8:50 in the next day or two.
BULL8|"Thank you."""
