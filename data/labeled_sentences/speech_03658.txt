BEAR0|"""Valiant the embattled pharmaceutical giant is giving investors a bit of a headache this Monday as the company cancelled its earnings call and withdrew its guidance."
BEAR1|Valiant stock is down nearly 9% this morning and here, with analysis as Wall Street Journal heard on the street, columnist Charlie Grant welcome Charlie Great to have you with us so you like so many other people were all set for this earnings call this morning.
NEUT2|Since you cover Valiant what happened last night?
NEUT3|Well Valiant put out a press release making a host of announcements, one of which is it's.
NEUT4|C Michael Pearson, who has been on leave with the case of pneumonia, is returning to the company effective immediately, so that's good news.
NEUT5|Absolutely, that's something that investors wanted to hear.
NEUT6|His status has been a question for months, and he has been a very popular CEO.
NEUT7|Invite his job is going to get split up is that's right, he will no longer be chairman.
NEUT8|Valiant is separating the role of Chairman and CEO effective immediately, and the interim chairman will be staying on board as a full time one.
NEUT9|OK, but why no earnings call?
NEUT10|What's the deal?
NEUT11|Well, that's the real question.
BEAR12|Their valiant had said on Tuesday last week that it would be hosting an unaudited conference call, meaning that its external auditors have not signed off on full year financial results.
NEUT13|But investors were still expecting to get some kind of commentary from the company today about how the fourth quarter went and what they were expecting to see in 2016.
BEAR14|So, just as scary for investors as the fact that they pulled the earnings call is they withdrew previous guidance and bring us up to speed on some of the challenges that value.
BEAR15|It's been facing recently.
BEAR16|Sure, Valiant has been embroiled in a bit of a controversy surrounding a specialty pharmacy that it had.
NEUT17|It had purchased an option to acquire and had not disclosed this relationship in their financial statements.
BEAR18|The end result is that there are possible changes to past financial results coming and Valiant is needs to replace this revenue somehow.
BEAR19|So there are short term challenges surrounding the financial reporting.
NEUT20|But there are also long term challenges about how Valiant can generate growth.
NEUT21|If it's old, corporate strategy isn't working anymore, so does valiance course table of high performing drugs that still stand.
NEUT22|Is that enough?
NEUT23|Will get it through?
BULL24|Well, it's Valiant, has made its bones by selling drugs, older assets, and managing to turn rather impressive sales numbers from those drugs.
BEAR25|But there are signs that that game is going to be harder in the future.
NEUT26|It stop selling drugs.
NEUT27|Drugs, if Assan, which is an irritable bowel treatment was there's a patent challenge being filed by Actavis for this drug.
BULL28|In theory this means that Valeant could face generic competition in the near future.
NEUT29|That's not right away.
NEUT30|I mean there will have to be legal challenges and value.
NEUT31|It says they will defend their rights vigorously, but that's a drug investors are counting on Valley and spent about $10 billion to acquire this thing last year.
BEAR32|And now there are challenges absolutely so right now there's a lot of murkiness.
NEUT33|What is it that investors need to hear that they want to hear to quell their uneasiness?
NEUT34|I think the most important thing in the short term is to hear updated financial guidance.
BEAR35|It's very alarming to project 21% revenue growth, which is what they had said back in December and reiterated in January at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, and now that's uncertain.
NEUT36|So investors, and until we hear more from them about just what, why, the change and what they expect 2016 to look like, there's going to be a lot of mystery here.
NEUT37|No news in this case is not good news.
NEUT38|Ignorance is not bliss for investors.
NEUT39|All right Charlie grant?
BULL40|"Thank you so much for that."""
