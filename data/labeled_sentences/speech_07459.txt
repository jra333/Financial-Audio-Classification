BULL0|"""He treated for quite a while."
NEUT1|I was trying to catch a strong bullish movement from this structure.
NEUT2|Lil and you know, following this major full action line, did the market broke recently?
NEUT3|You know I was looking for a strong bullish wave from the trendline after his three tests, but each and every time with the market features that you can see that the reactions are not that strong.
BULL4|And you know, if talking about the intraday perspective, the the pullbacks may give a nice profit treating this wings.
NEUT5|Right here you can see that the moves are very very very very slow and it looks like the market here is preparing for one more bearish wave from the current perspective it looks like you know the market here is very very very bearish and with the low hoys right here and with this horizontal structure support, it looks like it is the perfect example of the Bureau's accumulation.
NEUT6|So your plan right now on $1.00 cat is to wait for the break out of this structure to the downside.
NEUT7|Yes, remember that we need the deal.
NEUT8|Kindle crews believe this structure.
NEUT9|Yes, the Dilly violation dilly breakout.
BEAR10|Only when the delete Kindle closes, we confirmed the violation of this current structure, support and then you know, most likely the price will go down.
NEUT11|You can see that if we open the 3D short and look left at structure, the closest strong structure is all the way down.
NEUT12|Right here you can see very, very very very, very far.
NEUT13|And the problem is that between the structure between the current structure in this structure, within, which is don't see any major structure, we have some small structure shelf right here.
NEUT14|Around 1:24, six five levels, so it can be the next goal for Boyers the local one.
NEUT15|So you know preparing for the bearish continuation, and one more clue that they wanted to show you is on the hourly chart.
NEUT16|Let's open the hourly chart and on hourly chart.
NEUT17|Here is one more example of the bureau's accumulation.
NEUT18|Here we have the.
BULL19|Falling trendline yes.
NEUT20|Here we have the horizontal structure support and again we see the local bearish descending triangle.
NEUT21|So everywhere we see kind of the same clues everywhere we see that the market is preparing for the bearish move.
NEUT22|So you know, be prepared.
NEUT23|Be prepared.
NEUT24|I knew that.
NEUT25|Quite awhile we saw some bullish clues right here, but you know the breakout of this triangle to the on site.
BEAR26|Daily violation of the major support that we earlier identified.
NEUT27|It will eat me.
NEUT28|Trigger if you're strong.
NEUT29|Bearish way.
NEUT30|So be prepared to this.
NEUT31|"Just a quick update for delicate and let's see how it all will play out this."""
