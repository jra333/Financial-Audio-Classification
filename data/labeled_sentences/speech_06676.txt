NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, April 26.
BEAR2|I'm Celina Nicholas technical analysts that exam.com today will look at the Australian dollar versus U.S. dollar on the daily chart so we can see a D USD drop back below its 200 day moving average.
BEAR3|Today it's looking bearish for the intraday, at least at its testing.
NEUT4|A key level at point.
NEUT5|75 right now.
NEUT6|If if if prices do bounce back higher.
BEAR7|Of course this 200 day moving average would offer some intraday resistance, and that's currently at point 7552 and moving higher.
BULL8|From this we we have a key psychological level of .76, and that's also where the 50 day moving average is currently converging along this level, so it's expected.
NEUT9|To be a key barrier to the upside and further above.
NEUT10|From here we would either March 30 near one month high of point 7679 and then we have the key level of .77.
BEAR11|But Alternatively, if prices continue falling and we have daily close below .75, we would target low three months, eleven point 7472 that was April 12, low that would provide support and then from here there's scope to fall towards another key level of .74, another psychological level, if we look at indicators, mostly flat.
NEUT12|The RSI is basically moving sideways just below the 50 lines.
BEAR13|It's still in bearish territory and the 200 day moving average is basically flat, so it's trendless and 50 days.
NEUT14|Well it's not really indicating a trend.
BEAR15|Alert is starting to slope down, so it's hinting to a more bearish bias in the short term at least, but for now we could say the bias.
NEUT16|Is mostly neutral.
BEAR17|We're expecting consolidation and for the pair to trade sideways in the near term, holding within a range around point 7475 and .76.
NEUT18|So that's for the near term.
NEUT19|But if you look at the bigger picture as well, it's also look at neutral and probably the pair is expected to trade in a broader range of .75 and .77.
BULL20|Thanks so much for watching.
BULL21|"Have a great day."""
