NEUT0|"""Tom's Best Buy now lemonade."
BULL1|Lemonade scores a spot on Motley Fool.
NEUT2|Best Buy now list for the second month in a row and the third time in four months.
BEAR3|Since February Best Buy now designation, the stock is down about 40%.
BEAR4|That drop is not associated with any fundamental deterioration in the business that we can see.
BULL5|So today could represent a compelling buying opportunity if you have yet to pick up any shares.
NEUT6|It's not the recent stock performance and current valuation that have us excited about this upstart insurer, though.
NEUT7|We are more interested in what the future holds for this business.
NEUT8|Lemonade does not yet offer auto insurance.
NEUT9|No umbrella insurance either.
NEUT10|Currently it doesn't even offer policies for landlords looking to rent out their property.
BULL11|We look at those holes in the product line and we see significant potential growth avenues ahead.
NEUT12|That potential growth isn't a pipe dream either.
BULL13|In the most recent quarter, revenue per customer was up, indicating that existing customers like their experience enough to purchase more insurance from lemonade when it is offered.
NEUT14|This is a company that offered just one type of insurance in only 27 U.S. states at the time of its IPO last July.
NEUT15|Now it offers three main types with at least one offering available in all 50 states.
BULL16|Growth has been strong and fast since the IPO.
BULL17|With an expanding customer base and the opportunity to sell more to those clients, we think lemonade is just getting started.
NEUT18|Speaking of satisfied customers, I count myself among them.
NEUT19|Last month I purchased Life insurance from lemonade.
NEUT20|The process was simple and took just a few minutes.
BULL21|This simplicity is a key advantage for the company.
NEUT22|It's not as if it has come up with some new product.
NEUT23|No one has ever heard of, but everyone suddenly thinks they need insurance has been around in some form for almost the entire T of human civilization.
NEUT24|Lemonade's innovations lie in the user interface and the customer experience.
NEUT25|Speaking as someone who has purchased insurance multiple times in my life from different providers, I'm of the opinion that that innovation has real value, especially for lemonades target customer.
NEUT26|The customer experience matters.
NEUT27|Ease of use matters.
NEUT28|That's something lemonade understands and is using to great advantage.
BULL29|With lemonade we have a company that is delighting customers and improving the traditional experience in its industry.
BULL30|Even better for long term investors, the market looks to be offering us an opportunity to buy in at price points lower than we've seen this year.
