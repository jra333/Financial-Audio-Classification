BEAR0|"""Frenzy bullish bets are swirling around the biggest US tech names."
BULL1|It's breaking records and sending waves through the options markets here, with the analysis, Bloomberg, Danny Berger.
BEAR2|Another frenzy is almost an understatement.
BEAR3|We've really seen option volumes skyrocket this from Goldman Sachs since the start of the year.
BULL4|We've seen volume surge 77% and that was coming from a record already here.
NEUT5|This is showing that basically just as many options trade as the underlying stock itself, and it's the highest on record dominating this.
NEUT6|By far is call options as bullish options and most of it is driven in the high flying tech names and Tesla.
BEAR7|Of course now Tesla sell the biggest increase, but besides them the next biggest increase in options comes from Microsoft and the call options in White has absolutely exploded.
NEUT8|We saw some of the biggest amounts of bowl options and we're seeing that there costing more than puts for the first time in quite a few years and a lot of this is likely FOMO.
BEAR9|Investors are wary about the high valuations.
BEAR10|They really do not want to miss the rally.
NEUT11|I wanna point out there also seems to be a large retail component to this.
NEUT12|Just as an example, here are the mentions of Microsoft sticker on a popular subreddit that's dedicated to markets and you can see went from barely any options to just within a few days.
NEUT13|Hundreds of mentions, a lot of them I should say revolve around trading options themselves.
NEUT14|Now, Goldman says that these gains can't last for much longer.
NEUT15|"So rather than buying call options, they recommend you should be selling them that Anna."""
