NEUT0|"""Guys also keeping an eye on shares of Palantir, which I think they meant we mentioned."
BULL1|Or I think Don mentioned at the end of Squawk Box course reporting earnings and the stock had been up dramatically, but Mike, another thing people have been very focused on is the lock up.
NEUT2|Best we can tell from the S one of the lock up expires in a few days.
NEUT3|I think it's on the 19th.
BEAR4|According to this one, the lockup expired on the third Day posts fourth quarter earnings.
NEUT5|That's today, so we're talking the 19th, and there's an awful lot of shares out there.
NEUT6|Conceivably that will suddenly be unlocked.
NEUT7|I mean, I'm looking at remaining 1.863 billion shares including shares, Esteban exercise of outstanding stock options to be sold after the lock up.
NEUT8|Which would appear to be very close to expiring.
NEUT9|Yeah, and keep in mind this was one of those companies that has existed for a very long time in private hands, before it came public, that often is.
NEUT10|Is a situation where you do have you know equity spread very widely throughout the company, so you have this idea that there is a wall of potential surprise people have been there awhile, been waiting for it.
NEUT11|On the other hand, the pattern has been that whatever selling often happens in anticipation of the actual lockup expiration date and the market kind of figures that out.
NEUT12|So we'll see if that that happens here, but of course that stock is up so much since its initial listing that you know it's sort of playing with House money there.
NEUT13|I think on all sides.
NEUT14|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT15|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
