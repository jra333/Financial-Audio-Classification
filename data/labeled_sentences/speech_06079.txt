NEUT0|"""Alright, it's Monday, March 30th, 2020 at seven forty 4:14 AM Eastern Standard Time."
BEAR1|US and I see the three hardest hit stocks in the market, Boeing.
BULL2|Going to highs going higher, going higher highs you could see that Boeing, you know, spiked literally from a base of 95 in the middle of March up to 180, spiking 100% coming back down, and I think that.
BULL3|Basically it will hold here and Spike back up quite nicely.
NEUT4|Did the one 80s and maybe even higher.
BULL5|Disney very aggressively coming down from the one 40s to the 83 area coming down and again I see this spiking quite nicely.
BEAR6|Both of these companies are down.
BEAR7|Exponentially off of their highs.
NEUT8|The last doc I'd like to discuss is United Airlines.
BEAR9|You can see that it's coming down hugely off of this nice spike high and 38 coming on Thursday.
BULL10|"I think that it'll spike back to 35 and potentially get back up to the 40s in the coming days."""
