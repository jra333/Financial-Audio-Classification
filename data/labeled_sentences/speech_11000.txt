NEUT0|"""Hi and welcome back to the channel for another NEO stock analysis."
NEUT1|In today's video we're looking at NEO stock and why neous prices dropped.
BEAR2|The stock was trading lower today, even though there has been no negative news.
BULL3|The opposite, actually, with Neil receiving good news as they reported record deliveries for the month of November.
BEAR4|So why has the price dropped the last couple days?
NEUT5|There does not seem to be any one particular reason for the drop.
BEAR6|I think the price has dropped mainly due to people profit taking or new investors panicking and selling as the price dropped this week.
BULL7|This week has not changed the outlook for NEO as I still see this company growing rapidly in the coming years.
BULL8|This dip in price has just allowed us to buy more shares at a good price moving forward.
NEUT9|I hope you enjoyed the quick update on Neo stock for the day.
