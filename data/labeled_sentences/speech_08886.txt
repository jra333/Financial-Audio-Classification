NEUT0|"""Also guys, it's your boy will back into the video today."
BEAR1|I'm talking bout AMC stock and give you guys my AMC stock predictions at my AMC stock analysts and also some key levels so AMC stock has been coming down.
NEUT2|It kind of went up a little bit and came back down more.
NEUT3|I actually like this down move.
NEUT4|Because they had a small uptrend.
BEAR5|It looks small, but the percentages were like 57% in just two days from that low to high.
BULL6|That's what that is a very big movement if you can at least get half of that like 25%, that is a great return on your money in just a day or two, right?
NEUT7|Like hedge funds and stuff, they try to get that in a whole year.
NEUT8|OK, so you just make it in two days.
BULL9|That's very good.
NEUT10|To just keep that in the back of your mind and as this coming down closer to this level, I do want to buy it.
NEUT11|I want to get some and she shares.
BEAR12|I think it might see some buying pressure off this level.
BEAR13|I see some support off those levels as well.
NEUT14|Around that $5 area.
BEAR15|OK now if it rips through that and doesn't show any buying pressure then I think the price will be going down to around $3.47.
BEAR16|And I think that would be another buying pressure as well, but hopefully this buying pressure.
NEUT17|I do want to buy around here this $5 area and then I want it to start pushing up towards the moon.
NEUT18|At least go to $10.
NEUT19|OK, so from 5 to 10 that's about almost 100%.
NEUT20|I'm trying to at least get 50% off that play, but that is how I'm looking at it right now and this level is at 516 and this level appear was just a resistance level that I said if it busts through there, they now be very bullish for the stock.
NEUT21|But as you can see it came down.
NEUT22|Rejected, rejected after market rejected.
BEAR23|So this is a strong selling pressure on this stock.
BULL24|So that's why I said if it came up through here with good volume, good pressure up that have been very bullish, and I think the stock would rocket.
NEUT25|But right now I want to get it right here.
BULL26|Just $5 level and then hopefully we will see some pressure and it will start rocking it up to the moon around that $10 area on AMC stock.
NEUT27|OK, so that's why I'm playing this stuck right now.
NEUT28|I am playing slowly.
NEUT29|I do have risk management.
NEUT30|I'm only going to be using about 1% per Folio.
NEUT31|So just in case it goes to zero, it won't affect your whole account.
NEUT32|OK, so I advise you guys do that as well.
NEUT33|You should like the video to describe unturned post notifications and I'll keep making updates as I see fit on the stock and also let me know what other stocks you guys are looking at an if you want me to look at them for you.
