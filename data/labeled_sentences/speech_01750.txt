NEUT0|"""Unusual activity time."
NEUT1|Pete what you got for us today?
NEUT2|I'm going to start off with Disney Scott and this one's pretty interesting.
BEAR3|'cause if you just go back to January 28, this stock actually got hit pretty hard with the rest of the markets and stock was trading about $169 a share.
NEUT4|Well they started buying calls at that point in time.
NEUT5|They were going out into April and then this last Thursday.
NEUT6|They were also buying and they were buying this week so the expiring on the on Friday they started going after those as well.
NEUT7|That was pretty aggressive.
NEUT8|While they're doing it all over again, except for now instead of the one 80s now they're buying the one 90s and they've bought approximately 4000 of those one 90s.
NEUT9|For about 270 up to about 370 the problem.
NEUT10|Right now those got his stock was trading about 185.
NEUT11|I just took a look.
BULL12|Stocks already moving to the upside.
NEUT13|It's already through 190 so a big move already starting to occur here in Disney but you could see this coming because of all this unusual that we're seeing in front of that second one is this BP we were just talking about energy and this big run that we've seen stock was trading about 21 and a quarter today and we had some pretty nice aggressive buying in their 4000 of this weeks expiring February 12th.
NEUT14|The 22 calls so just.
NEUT15|Out of the money calls very inexpensive there 15 to $0.25.
NEUT16|But what makes this the most interesting for me is they're buying XL, either buying xom, they're buying these BP's and they were buying accidental, so a lot of energy.
BULL17|Unusual buying today, and I think this BP stands out for me that this is a stock that absolutely could move to the upside even further.
NEUT18|Maybe men.
NEUT19|Both of these trades as I just mentioned.
NEUT20|Maybe you said this about Disney and forgive me if I just didn't hear you say it earnings or this Thursday, right?
NEUT21|So yes, Sir.
BULL22|This stock has had a nice ramp and it's going to have even a bigger ramp now into that number.
BULL23|Better be good report, yeah.
NEUT24|It better be a good report.
NEUT25|They're going to have to crush it, but we all know what's been going on with Disney and streaming and everything else got.
BULL26|So as sports return and ESPN's done much better.
NEUT27|I have to think that the anticipation is that people are looking at this saying you know what they might have knocked this out of the park.
NEUT28|So it looks like what people are saying right now.
NEUT29|As far as the option.
BULL30|Yeah, been a huge run Pete.
BULL31|"Thank you."""
