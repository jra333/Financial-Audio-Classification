NEUT0|"""But there has been this question raised not only by barons in the cover story there, but by other places too about whether Berkshire Hathaway would be worth more if it were split up."
NEUT1|That's it's a good question, and I will tell you that that.
NEUT2|If you were to say an let's say the stock market didn't change for two years and interest rates didn't change, so they had a two year.
NEUT3|Then you said will sell off all the businesses.
NEUT4|I don't think I mean you have the expenses of selling him now if you sold them all the people who leveraged him up to their maximum.
NEUT5|You might get a little more than the stock is selling for.

NEUT9|Corporate breakups, and so you could dispose of businesses or securities if you did it right.
NEUT10|You could dispose of securities or businesses that are appreciated without a tax at the corporate level.
NEUT11|That was done regularly in various ways up till 1986.
NEUT12|They revise the tax code.

NEUT16|Now you can go, you can have spin offs this business or that business.
NEUT17|You probably have to lie a little in terms of your purpose in order to.
NEUT18|Get the best tax ruling and it takes time, but you cannot break up.
NEUT19|You cannot dispose of the entire business business by business without having very substantial tax liability.
NEUT20|It would not produce again.
BULL21|On the other hand, having them together produces there's some very valuable synergies in there now.
NEUT22|We don't use leverage as much as the people who would buy him piece by piece would do, so we could leverage Berkshire up to the Sky.
NEUT23|I promised people we won't because we have insurance promises to people out 50 or 100 years, and we've got shareholders are going to own the stock for 50 years and they do not want us to.
NEUT24|To leverage this guy but.
NEUT25|"Would not be a profit if if we were simply to announce that over the next 24 months that you could come in and buy any business we had, and we'd sell them to the highest bidder."""
