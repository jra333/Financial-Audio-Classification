NEUT0|"""I think it makes a ton of sense that arrival starting with commercial markets rather than trying to say fight with Tesla for a piece of the consumer."
NEUT1|Electric fans are low hanging fruit for companies that want to get credit for protecting the environment and these days that's a lot of they want to meet all these ESG targets that are very aggressive.
BULL2|Meanwhile, when you see Hyundai and Kia putting their money on the line and something like this, that's very encouraging.
BULL3|When you see UPS ordering thousands of ants, well, that'll make a terrific case study and we know UPS is serious about going green even better.
NEUT4|Arrivals of British company with a distinctly European vibe.
NEUT5|That's a big deal because Europe is way ahead of the United States when it comes to enthusiasm for electric vehicles and mass transit in general.
NEUT6|Finally, let's talk valuation and this is what I think is going to have a lot of people upset and it's going to take a leap of faith except for the younger people who don't even want to listen to what I'm about to say.
NEUT7|Arrivals merging with CIGS?
BULL8|OK, that's the CIGS merger, and if the company can come anywhere close to immediate projections of the next few years, the valuation actually seems pretty reasonable.
NEUT9|With CIGS stock trading at 21 and change.
NEUT10|That translates into about 12.4 billion valuation for the combined company.
NEUT11|Given that arrivals talking about doing $5 billion in sales for 2023, well, that would mean the stock selling for 2.4 times sales in the out years.
NEUT12|Nothing crazy about that at all, as long as they hit their targets.
NEUT13|Of course, that does require usually the faith.
NEUT14|I think there's more reason to believe in arrival than most of the other electrics pack plays, but at the end of the day, this is still an early stage company.
NEUT15|It's still speculation.
BEAR16|OK, a lot of things could go wrong.
NEUT17|I'm telling you this because I don't want you to be disappointed.
NEUT18|If the stock could suddenly goes down $10 in a day because you're thinking about longer term here at the bottom line, as much as I like this story, I think you could be patient.
NEUT19|Arrival won't even merge with IG until sometime in the first quarter of next year, and you almost always get a better entry point with these SPAC deals when you wait for the stocks that come in.
NEUT20|That's why I'm saying this speculative and he got a big drop here.
BULL21|But given that much just ones already pulled back this week I'm giving my blessing to start picking at it tomorrow.
NEUT22|Then I want you to wait for maybe a better pitch that comes down below 1750.
NEUT23|You can buy it hand over fist because this one has the best claim to be the son of Tesla or daughter to break the tiriti.
NEUT24|Of that awful cliche.
