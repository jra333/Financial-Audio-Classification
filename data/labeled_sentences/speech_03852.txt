NEUT0|"""Welcome to charts that count."
NEUT1|Once Upon a time, there was a group of mean old hedge fund managers who got together and sold short, a sweet, innocent little company called GameStop.
NEUT2|GameStop sold games for goodness sake to children.
BULL3|But then a brave group of handsome young retail investors banded together.
BEAR4|Forced the price of GameStop shares up and drove the Wicked old fund managers out of their short positions.
BEAR5|This left the predatory hedge fund managers with big losses and the retail investors made big profits.
NEUT6|Saving GameStop array.
NEUT7|The end.
NEUT8|Of course, the real story is a little bit more complicated than this.
NEUT9|For one thing, there's actually quite a number of shares, not just GameStop that are jumping on heavy retail buying activity.
NEUT10|For example, BlackBerry Bed, Bath and Beyond, and AMC Entertainment like GameStop.
BEAR11|These are all smallish companies that have not been doing particularly well, and most of them have attracted a lot of attention from short sellers.
NEUT12|But not all of them.
BULL13|BlackBerry for example has quadrupled despite having quite low short interest.
BEAR14|And what's more, even as the biggest funds who had short positions in GameStop have exited.
NEUT15|40% of the shares are still sold short.
BEAR16|As some skeptics have left, others have replaced them.
NEUT17|This is not a simple short squeeze and the game is still on and on that point about retail investors getting rich.
NEUT18|Remember, this is a 0 sum game.
NEUT19|Some retail investors do have big paper profits they've won at the expense of the pros, and this is good fun to watch.
BEAR20|But GameStop is an unprofitable company with only slender turnaround prospects.
BEAR21|The shares will come down and come down hard at some point.
NEUT22|Who will be holding them when they do?
NEUT23|This is no fairy tale.
NEUT24|Instead, it's a children's game.
NEUT25|"Called musical chairs."""
