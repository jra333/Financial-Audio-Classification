NEUT0|"""Every year in his letter, Buffett gives an assessment of the company, highlighting what he thinks are the most important performers, and this year for the first time, the investment in Apple made that list."
NEUT1|Berkshire owns 5.4% of Apple, which based on Friday's closing price is worth almost $110 billion.
NEUT2|Buffett called it one of Berkshire's family jewels along with Berkshire's property and casualty insurance Group.
NEUT3|It's Burlington, Northern Santa Fe Railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.
NEUT4|Berkshire paid $36 billion to buy that Apple Stake.
NEUT5|It accumulated the purchases starting in late 2000.
NEUT6|And 16 and it went through the middle of 2018, and since then it sold a small part of the stake for $11 billion.
NEUT7|It's also received more than $2.3 billion in dividends from Apple, so all in that means that it's closer to $22.3 billion that they paid for the steak that is now worth almost $110 billion.
NEUT8|He writes in its brief 232 years of existence.
NEUT9|There's been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America, despite some severe interruptions.
BULL10|Our country's economic progress has been breathtaking.
NEUT11|Never bet against America and guys for the comments on the markets.
NEUT12|They were actually pretty sparse this time around, but he did say that bonds are not the place to be.
NEUT13|But his messages are very clear, which is.
NEUT14|It's hard to find cheap stocks if you value investors.
NEUT15|He didn't like bonds at that point and he believes in America as we all do, and he doesn't want to face the US, which I agree with.
NEUT16|So if you put all these things together, it leads him to buy back his own stock and it speaks to a very important signal to investors.
NEUT17|Is whatever you do at this point.
NEUT18|Make sure you know really well what you're buying.
NEUT19|Basically, the nature of what he looks at, his cash flow, quality of the cash flow, an evaluation on that multiple cash flow.
NEUT20|So in terms of my reading of it, not his.
NEUT21|He doesn't talk about the conglomerates except for the pointing out that the investment bankers love it, pushing an illusion.
NEUT22|Illusions last for long time he goes back to the 60s when I was there watching Charlie Blue, Dorn Jimmy Ling.
NEUT23|You know Janine and so on.
NEUT24|The conglomerates have we're looking at things to try to put together a cycle position for Wall Street, but it uses that analogy.
NEUT25|Becky also to talk about today as to how companies are put together.
NEUT26|How companies are put together for Wall Street, not necessarily for operating cash flow.
NEUT27|There's a lot of detail.
NEUT28|For example, in Clayton he talks about how well they did in the annual, but if you go into the details they only sold 2.5% more manufactured housing, and when you blend them together under his orchestra leader, how does he look at that?
NEUT29|So I would think the in quotes that conglomerate discount has value a lot of companies that I follow sell at a discount from what I think the takeover price would be.
NEUT30|So if you want to take over Berkshire, you're going to pay a much higher price.
NEUT31|Not going to do it because it's unlikely and then what is the benefit of splitting it up when you split it up, you got $280 million, of which 130,000,000 relates to the float that you know he's got in the insurance company.
NEUT32|"So there's a lot of moving parts."""
