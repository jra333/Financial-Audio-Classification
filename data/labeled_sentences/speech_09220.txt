NEUT0|"""We're talking crypto that will surprise no one."
NEUT1|Let's speak specifically about what Fidelity announced today.
BULL2|Fidelity of all firms is coming up with an institutional grade solution.
NEUT3|To what most firms find is their crypto problem.
NEUT4|Nowhere to store it.
NEUT5|No way that they're comfortable trading it, and they don't know what to do with their so-called digital assets.
NEUT6|Why is this important?
NEUT7|Listen we've been saying for a long time that one of the things that will get institutional investors involved in crypto is is custody solutions, and they're coming out with a world class custody solution aimed at institutions.
NEUT8|And so that's just a box that gets checked.
NEUT9|If you're at the state of X and thinking about making a pension and investment in crypto, you can take.
NEUT10|Custody off your service to those who don't immediately understand what custody is and why it's critical, what's custody in the rest of the Wall Street world?
NEUT11|Well, listen, so what's unique about Chris Crypto is their bearer instruments.
NEUT12|If I take your Bitcoin, it's gone.
NEUT13|If I take your theorem, it's gone, and so people are given key as opposed to say, the electronic record of the insured by my tone and your money gets stolen out of JP Morgan, they know exactly how much was there and they still owe you that money and so.
BEAR14|There's a lot of nervousness around storing these cryptographic keys that give you access to your Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever it is.
NEUT15|So if Fidelity successfully solves the custody problem, that means what for would be.
NEUT16|Clients will listen, so Fidelity is a start that allows would be clients to store their crypto keys there and feel comfortable that if I make a bet, my bet is that Bitcoin is going up and it goes up.
NEUT17|I win if it goes down, I lose, but I'm not going to make a bet.
NEUT18|And have it go up and have someone call and say oh, by the way we lost your crypto and so the having a trusted custody provider with insurance allows me to make the bed.
NEUT19|I want to make if I'm being the case.
NEUT20|If it is what Fidelity wants it to be and what you say it should be.
NEUT21|What I'm getting at is what does that mean?
NEUT22|What does that mean for the family office?
NEUT23|What does that mean for the hedge fund, the endowment, the pension plan?
NEUT24|It makes it easier?
NEUT25|Listen Jeff Jeff Sprecher it at back door ice, you know they put out back there.
NEUT26|They are also coming up with a custody solution.
NEUT27|Same firm that owns the NYSE indeed.
NEUT28|Goldman Sachs has talked about getting into it.
NEUT29|You know, bit go is is got a solution.
NEUT30|And so what's what's good for the spaces that you're getting multiple people involved in the place, all with kredible names and it's.
BULL31|Going to get that much closer from the consultants to say hey, this is a safe asset class we already had, you know.
NEUT32|Yale, Harvard, Stanford, North Carolina, make investments into Crypto venture funds or funds that are going to actually be based in crypto that do venture.
BULL33|That's a big big deal and so slowly but surely you're seeing institutions getting more comfortable with the whole asset class.
NEUT34|You have something of a vested interest here, right?
NEUT35|If institutions start to do more business in crypto, some of it is going to flow the way of your firm.
NEUT36|But you've been in a dialogue.
NEUT37|With these investors, some of whom are taking baby steps, and some of whom are still on the sidelines, if they can get custody if they can get a reliable agency.
NEUT38|Trading partner infidelity, does that mean that they're going to start 100%?
NEUT39|I 100% think now it's not gonna happen overnight, right?
NEUT40|Fidelity announced that it's not going to restart.
NEUT41|Well, Fidelity announced their business that I know probably be up and running in January or Q1, right?
NEUT42|And so?
NEUT43|And then you gotta run some water through the pipes.
NEUT44|So my guess is you start seeing.
NEUT45|Institutional flows into just purely crypto assets.
NEUT46|"Late first quarter early second quarter."""
