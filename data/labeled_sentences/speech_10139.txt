NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Tuesday, February 9th and the market is about to close.
NEUT2|Actually, it's almost 4:00 PM in this video I'm going to be talking about Innova Inc ticker symbol INUV.
NEUT3|As many of you know we have the earnings coming up on February 11th.
NEUT4|Currently in Novo is trading at 1.85.
BULL5|Which is a 12.8% increase from yesterday's price.
BEAR6|Looking at the RSI we it looks like we are entering into an overbought territory, so it's something to watch out for and also the Mac D is indicating of a possible downward movement.
NEUT7|One of the big things I like to watch out for is how far is the stock price from the 20 email line which is here the red line so we can see it's there is some distance to it and always when it comes to pricing.
NEUT8|The price always tries to catch up with the 20 E mainline.
NEUT9|So one thing I notice in terms of a pattern and I'm sure you would see it too, is this rounding bottom over here?
NEUT10|Which could be indicated with Cup and handle pattern.
NEUT11|So just based on the Mac D, the RSI.
NEUT12|The position of the 20 MA.
BEAR13|All of these signals align that we could have a temporary downward movement just for a few more days.
NEUT14|And it's also aligned with the earning report.
NEUT15|Because usually people say buy the rumor, sell the news so every time there's an announcement, unless they really beat numbers, we should expect the movement.
NEUT16|To the downside, just for a few days I would say probably around the dollar $50.60 before we continue our movement here and watch out for if we reach to this price around the one dollar $1.85.
BULL17|If we have a confirmation after that, we could see a breakout price and rally back up to $2.00 and 35 price high, which was back in January 20th.
NEUT18|Switching over to the hourly chart we could see again the rounding bottom that so caring.
NEUT19|So if we do have a Cup and handle movement then we should be aligned.
BULL20|Close to the 50 email line around the $1.60 and if we reached that level then we could see a turning back up to the dollar $80.90 before we rally back up.
BULL21|If however, the earnings report provides a positive news catalysts then we could have a rally back up to the $2.35 range before this pattern even forms.
NEUT22|It's an updated video in the next few days to see if we can get a confirmation on this.
NEUT23|Pattern as usual.
BULL24|"Thank you all for watching and seeing the next video."""
