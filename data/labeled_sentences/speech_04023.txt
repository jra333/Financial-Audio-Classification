BEAR2|Just a couple days ago, Hylian broke up above its resistance, and now we've been.
NEUT3|Heading.
NEUT4|I'm trying to say we basic in Sala dated between these two support and resistance lines.
NEUT5|It looks like there is some form of resistance where.
NEUT6|If you could see it right here, where basically went all the way down, try to get above it couldn't.
NEUT7|And where we broke down at.
BULL8|If we can break above it, I can see us continuing heading this uptrend.
BEAR9|For today's trading, there's potential that we may lose steam here.
NEUT10|Head down.
NEUT11|Hit this double support which will see and then at that point right up.
BULL12|If we can break above it, we can maybe continue this trend all the way up until about 25 or so.
NEUT13|I don't see resistance.
NEUT14|Yeah, I'd say 2525 Sir.
NEUT15|But that's what I see.
NEUT16|Has to be short.
BULL17|Shark Invest was buying some of this and make me feel a little bit better.
