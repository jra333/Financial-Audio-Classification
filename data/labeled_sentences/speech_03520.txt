NEUT0|"""Guys and girls."
BULL1|Hope you're doing very well.
NEUT2|One will come to trade with the same analysts for.
NEUT3|7 April 2021.
NEUT4|As you guys know that that I did mention that the highest target is going to be our one around 1740 and the highest it went was 1745 which is almost hit the target.
NEUT5|Currently is it's.
BULL6|It's kind of a bullish momentum and it's rising on daily basis as well.
NEUT7|Before I give my final verdict on that one, I'll just look into the four hour chart as well.
NEUT8|As you can see on 4 hour chart, I will expect that it will try to attend at least 1745 on our two and on daily basis as well.
NEUT9|I would expect that it will attend almost 1750 or 1754 is going to be above or one, but.
NEUT10|People will think that it will break.
BEAR11|The rate has broken the resistance and people will start buying around 1754 and but then I do expect that it will fall down to our one again which is around 1740.
BULL12|It will fall again and it might rise again once again but the ******** that it's going to be bouncing Bank would be around 1750 so I'm expecting on 7 April that it will be bullish and highest that it might go.
NEUT13|It is going to go to 1750 or 1754.
NEUT14|That's what would be my highest target on for the 7th April long term.
BEAR15|I'm bearish on it guys.
BULL16|The reason that I'm expecting a bearish momentum even though on daily I'm bullish.
BEAR17|But on a long term I'm expecting a bearish momentum be cause of the weekly chart.
BEAR18|It's below the pivot and we have seen a lot of huge spikes an on the same level I'm expecting is that it's.
BEAR19|Into a bearish momentum because at the end of month it will fall down and it will try to breach my monthly target is around 1650, so that's all from me from trade with us in four seven April.
NEUT20|I am bullish.
NEUT21|That's all from me.
