BULL0|"""Welcome back to Squawk Box."
NEUT1|Amazon bringing its cashier List store concept to a bigger stage, the company set to open Amazon Go Grocery in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood today has about four times the space is the smaller Amazon Go convenience store and is targeting customers in residential areas.
NEUT2|As with Amazon go no cashier's or checkout lines at all.
NEUT3|You need the app.
NEUT4|I have it.
NEUT5|I've been to the the the other one.
NEUT6|I haven't been to this one obviously yet, but.
NEUT7|It's pretty extraordinary.
NEUT8|It's a little spooky actually, because you literally walk in, take the stuff you want, put it in the thing, and leave.
NEUT9|And it just check to see if the charge the right amount it charges the right amount.
NEUT10|There's thousands of cameras on the ceiling.
NEUT11|And lights and all sorts of things happening, but you don't really.
NEUT12|You don't even think about it.
NEUT13|I mean, I was obviously studying it 'cause I was so curious about how this was working, but I wouldn't be able to help workers or around watching you do this.
NEUT14|Very few hardly any.
NEUT15|No, I mean, that was the miraculous part.
NEUT16|You walk in, scans your thing, so knows that you're you're who you are and then you walk around doing all the stuff.
NEUT17|It's cool.
NEUT18|But even when I go to the grocery store and I scan every item myself, sometimes it messes up.
NEUT19|It doesn't take something, it double charges something, even when I'm sitting and putting it physically on the scanner myself.
NEUT20|I don't know, but I think that they're catching it.
NEUT21|They're catching it as you're taking it from the.
NEUT22|Off the shelf and then that's good that you're there by yourself and not with a couple of kids trying to stuff stuff in and out of the card.
NEUT23|So yeah, I don't know.
NEUT24|That's my only question with it.
NEUT25|They have not perfected the stuff that you have in the grocery store yourself when you're using the scanner.
NEUT26|Going through all of it like I think this is great news if they're better hours and times more sophisticated than that whole situation.
NEUT27|"Hey, by the way, also probably cost him 1000 times more to actually do it."""
