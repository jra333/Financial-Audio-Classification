NEUT0|"""At what point, at what level is your actually problematic for the euro area?"
NEUT1|Well, I mean this is a complicated issue.
NEUT2|I have to say I don't think that the current level of the currency matters that much.
NEUT3|I mean, we're not living in the 1970s anymore.
NEUT4|Companies don't pass on currency moves in the way that they did 50 years ago, and as a result, what it matters to most of the time is corporate profits for exporters and importers rather than for sort of the wider real economy.
NEUT5|But where you get very sudden moves.
NEUT6|That can be very disruptive for companies, so a very fast move is something that would be problematic rather than necessarily the absolute level we are hovering around.
NEUT7|Fair value in euro dollar at the moment, and so I don't think that the current level itself is particularly problematic, and I don't think that the move is also particularly shocking, so I think you know the ECB economists Lane is is trying to take preemptive action on the euro.
NEUT8|He doesn't want to bigger move from here.
BEAR9|"But I don't actually think that we are in a particularly bad place with it."""
