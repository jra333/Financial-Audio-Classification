NEUT0|"""Hello fellow traders, welcome to these news you plan to manage stock analysis, this time for Apple ticker AAPL."
NEUT1|This is writing disclaimer.
NEUT2|You can pause the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT3|OK, let's bring the.
NEUT4|Well this is not Apple.
NEUT5|The Apple Chard check look at this.
NEUT6|This is the Apple chart so we have the monthly time from here we have a nap trend after breaking all time has which are located here.
NEUT7|All this there's nothing on the left here.
BULL8|All time highs over there so we have a very strong impulse that created imbalance down there.
NEUT9|So it is.
NEUT10|Is it safe and high probability to go long right now?
NEUT11|Well, I must say that it is not.
NEUT12|Ask would continue to rally for more months, but after so such strong impulses we usually have a bigger retracement.
NEUT13|So the origin of the move that or even or maybe half of it.
NEUT14|And then we're going to have new areas of the man being created.
NEUT15|But after such a strong impulse we should not be thinking of going long and buy more Apple stock 'cause the underlying stock Apple in this case is very expensive.
NEUT16|Look where we were like 5 months ago or $217.00 per share and now we are like us.
NEUT17|300 this is too expensive when you are being loan from down there prices up there then you will be.
NEUT18|Will be probably thinking of taking profits of that.
NEUT19|I mean it's human nature.
BEAR20|So as per supply dimensions this is the strongest imbalance on the chart.
NEUT21|So it could take a few months for practice to trace down there.
NEUT22|That doesn't mean we cannot try Apple.
NEUT23|You could go short and long.
NEUT24|It's more time frames.
NEUT25|This is just a long term.
NEUT26|Alesis for Apple.
NEUT27|That's it.
NEUT28|We are interested down there for hyperlite.
BEAR29|The more price rallies or moves in a direction they lower the probability it is to trade in that direction.
NEUT30|As simple as that and that's everything.
