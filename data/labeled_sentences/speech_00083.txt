NEUT2|Well today I'll be talking about Nano Dimension's ticker symbol, an MDM and this is a 15 minute chart.

NEUT9|So let's get into the video.
NEUT10|So this was a resistance at first, this was a 61.
NEUT11|This is I was looking at is for resistance.
BEAR12|As you can see it was having a hard time going up there and then yesterday is shot through held came down but it's still holding price.
BEAR13|So this is a resistance services support.
NEUT14|So now if price does come down here I would like to see this as some support and maybe get in a little bit of shares right here because ultimately I want to get in below 8.
NEUT15|I think this might be a little too high but I might get a little bit of shares right here but I want to see how price reacts at this level.
NEUT16|But if it does start falling through.
NEUT17|This is the last support level for me to still be bullish in the short term is longer term.
BEAR18|I am bullish but short term if it falls below here then I'll be short term bearish and looking for price to come down here.
NEUT19|And this is when I would definitely get in more shares of price comes down here and this is level 736 so this is a support level I see if this one breaks and this level is 825 for last defense but if price starts going higher and price starts making new highs.
BEAR20|Then I'll wait to see for that pullback 'cause right now price has been trading sideways and a bigger range.
NEUT21|From like $10 to $7.00, it just went right into range, so I'm not trying to get chopped up in this movement.
NEUT22|I want directional movement when I get in.
NEUT23|It's like this.
NEUT24|This is easier money made and this is harder money made so we're going away from the direction.
NEUT25|But these are three loads I'm looking at, so I hope you guys like this video.
