NEUT0|"""That's how I feel about these terrific tech companies that account for more than 20% of the S&P 500."
NEUT1|They're all coming in too hot, and I'm like those Navy pilots.
NEUT2|They don't get it do over so will they come into art and go right over the side?
NEUT3|Or will they manage to pull out and live to play again?
BULL4|I think they're all going to live to play again despite the warnings of Goldman Sachs today.

NEUT6|Alphabet stock is actually cheap, although they could easily find a way to screw it up.
BEAR7|Management doesn't play for the quarter Facebook Mass, so it might be inevitable there because the long knives are always out for Mark Zuckerberg and the bar for Amazon is the highest ever been, which is worrisome.
NEUT8|Because Amazon is a little like alphabet and that they don't play for the quarter either.
NEUT9|They play for the long haul.
BEAR10|All of them are coming in too hot, especially with the big tech antitrust hearings on Capitol Hill next week.
NEUT11|So what do you do if you want to own these stocks right now?
NEUT12|You gotta be willing to take some pain.
NEUT13|You're going to have to watch the rest of the market catch up a bit to them while they decline in value, but at some point they'll make you come back, because these are indeed the best companies on Earth.
