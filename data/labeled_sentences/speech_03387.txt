NEUT0|"""Talk about this IPO, what it means and why."
NEUT1|Now what do you think so far?
NEUT2|Well look, you know people love the story.
BULL3|They love the company and we're better positioned than most companies.
BULL4|Is that the leisure recovery comes back and the time is now because America's reopening an we're best positioned to exploit all that demand that spin up.
BULL5|You are seeing a return.
BULL6|We've heard that prices are going to be going up that more people are flying and that people are starting to feel better, especially as the vaccines really roll out across the country.
NEUT7|What have you seen most recently, just in terms of passenger bookings and the travel that's going through on Frontier?
NEUT8|Well, look, we're seeing the vaccine unlock that demand is everyone is expected, and when we look at the month of March we went cash flow positive, and so that's just a reflection of the demand picture.
NEUT9|But it's just getting going, I mean.
NEUT10|You know, here we are in New York today.
NEUT11|The quarantine restriction is gone, and by Memorial Day it's going to be big.
NEUT12|What can you tell me in terms of the bookings that you're seeing?
NEUT13|What is it now versus a month ago?
NEUT14|Oh, it's it's well.
NEUT15|Month ago we turned at the beginning of March.
BULL16|We turn cash positive, but it's up considerably versus a few months ago.
BEAR17|You know, January February was very low.
NEUT18|Kind of at the height of the pandemic, but we've just seen that vaccine chip away at the fear of flying if you will, and the fear of travel and people are getting back out.
NEUT19|And so so the demand is what's driving us to be cash flow positive now?
NEUT20|Very of the the IPO priced at the low end of the expected range at $19.00.
NEUT21|Why do you think that is?
NEUT22|Well, look?
NEUT23|I mean, I'm not an expert on this, but look, there's been a lot of things going on in the market lately, but I can just tell you that people are excited about this story and excited about the company and our prospects and where America's greenest airline and we're positioned a lot differently than a lot of other companies.
NEUT24|I mean, when you look at the Premier green brands like Tesla Patagonian Frontier, what really differentiates us and makes us kind of a better play is that were the lowest costs for the consumer.
NEUT25|And the best for your wallet so people are just really excited about the story.
NEUT26|What do you mean you're the greenest where the green is 1 metrics based on CO2 but principally 97 miles per gallon per passenger per seat, and that compares to the industry that's in the 60s, so it's considerably much more efficient.
NEUT27|What do you guys do differently?
NEUT28|All types of things we use the latest technology.
NEUT29|Modern aircraft, the Airbus NEO is over half of our fleet, but we fly it more efficiently and just every way that we operate the airline.
NEUT30|We were very conscious about how little fuel we can get away with.
NEUT31|That's a pretty big differential that your average versus the rest of of other carriers averages.
NEUT32|What do you do to operate more efficiently?
NEUT33|I understand you might be flying a larger fleet using these newer jets, but how do you fly them more efficiently than other people do?
NEUT34|Well, everything from avoiding congested times congested airports.
NEUT35|We, for example, we don't have as much food and beverage on board as you might normally expect.
NEUT36|We have half the galley carts and even last week we just introduced new Recaro seats that are Â£1000 less.
NEUT37|Aircraft, and just that alone, saves US $30,000 in fuel each year per airplane.
NEUT38|So we're just always looking for ways to make the aircraft lighter, and then how we actually operate it to burn less fuel because there's many ways to get you from A to B.
NEUT39|But how much fuel you burn is what differentiates us, and it's I think it really drives home all of the things that we do from an efficiency perspective that not only makes us lowest X fuel costs in 2019, but also the lowest from a fuel cost as well.
