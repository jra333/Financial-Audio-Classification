NEUT0|"""The mortgage price is in a consolidation pattern with no inherent bias."
BEAR1|Hence a breakout from this phase could push the tokens price in either direction.
BEAR2|The mortgage price slid into consolidation, creating lower highs and higher lows due to aggressive, yet diminishing pressure from both buyers and sellers.
NEUT3|By connecting the swing highs and lows using trendlines, a symmetrical triangle pattern forms.
NEUT4|This technical formation forecasts of 40% breakout, which is the distance between the swing high and low created on March 11th and 12.
BULL5|Since this setup has no bias, a decisive close above $0.38 will result in a 40% bull run to 54 cents.
BEAR6|On the other hand, a breakdown of the lower trendline at $0.31 will kickstart a downward trend to $0.19.
BEAR7|And increased seller activity at the current price will quickly push Polygon tored the lower trendline.
BEAR8|However, a breakout here will spell trouble for the modage price.
BEAR9|A 13% drop to the immediate demand barrier at 27 cents, coinciding with the 200 SMAD on the six hour chart, seems likely.
BEAR10|If this level is pierced by overwhelming selling pressure polygone could indeed slide 30% to tap the intended target at $0.19.
BULL11|Adding credence to the bearish outlook as a slew of underwater investors as seen in into the blocks in out of the money around price ioma P model.
BEAR12|IOM AP reveals that 13,200 addresses that hold nearly 800,000,000 modage tokens are out of the money and might break even dampening the bullish momentum.
BEAR13|Additionally, the number of whales holding between 100,000 to 1,000,000 modage tokens has reduced by 8.5% from 979 to 118.
NEUT14|Following a similar trend are the investors that hold 1,000,000 to 10 million modage tokens.
BEAR15|These market participants have cut down their exposure to modage tokens by 13.5% since March 11th.
BEAR16|Such a drastic reduction suggests that the whales aren't optimistic about the modage prices bullish potential.
BEAR17|While the downward breakout seems set in stone, it could be altered by a strong surge in buyers or new capital flowing into the mortgage markets.
BEAR18|If this momentum manage is to push the price past the $0.40 supply barrier and create a higher high around $0.45, it will invalidate the bearish outlook.
BULL19|"In fact, such a move might catalyze a run up to $0.54."""
