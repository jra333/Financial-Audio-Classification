BULL0|"""By now the world is had about one week to absorb China's Q3 GDP."
BEAR1|Number growth was at 4.9% year on year, about half a percent below consensus.
NEUT2|But what's interesting in China's growth is not the headline number, but what lies underneath under face of it.
BULL3|4.9% growth sounds pretty great.
BEAR4|China is still the engine of the world's economy, but its forward motion has slowed significantly.
BEAR5|Except for the negative 6.8% growth in Q1 and the positive 3.2% growth in Q2, the Q3 number was the weakest quarterly growth in decades.
BULL6|What's more though is that China's industrial sector is doing great industrially focused measures like the Lisa Kyang index, which looks at rail freight volumes, electrical consumption, and bank loans show growth rates of around 8 to 9% per year.
BULL7|That's in line with pre pandemic paces of expansion.
BEAR8|But if China's industrial sector is outperforming, that implies that China's service sector must be underperforming, and that fits into the narrative that China is experiencing.
BULL9|AK shaped recovery, where parts of the economy are going upwards, including industry and sectors, where workers can telecommute, whereas other segments of China's economy are not doing so well.
BEAR10|And these include services where people must be present at work, in person, the transportation sector, and smaller businesses are also hard hit.
BULL11|Next, China's debt levels soared across the board in the first nine months of the year.
NEUT12|So far in 2020, as a percentage of GDP.
BULL13|Household debt rose from 56 to 61%.
BULL14|Non financial corporate debt increased from 150 to 163% and public sector debt rose from 38 to 44%.
BULL15|Overall, China's level of leverage rose from 244% to 269% of GDP.
BEAR16|In just nine months, according to China's National Statistics Bureau and the People's Bank of China, rising debt levels might imply a downshift to a much slower pace of growth for China into 2020, and that could have wide ranging implications for both commodity prices and for the currencies of commodity exporting countries.
