NEUT0|"""We're going to start, though."
NEUT1|I guess Jim broadly with the markets Tom Lee with his note out this morning saying the kinds of upside positive reversals that we got yesterday, are not the kinds of things you see when equities are truly topping.
NEUT2|He's right, I thought that yesterday was one of those days where people said.
BULL3|Oh, thank heavens, I got a chance to get in.
NEUT4|Get in before the end of the year.
NEUT5|There were many stocks that came back from many different groups as if almost you know there's something for everyone.

BEAR20|Although you could also argue yesterday was a strange day, because in some ways it was surprising we were down as much on the UK strain news, which wasn't clear.
BEAR21|At least I think that how much of a negative.
NEUT22|It is or will be in terms of.
NEUT23|Transmissibility virulence doesn't seem to be impacted now.
