BULL0|"""Hey fellow Masters, this is Charlie Temple focus again and very glad to be back today."
NEUT1|I want to make a preview of the upcoming Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting.
NEUT2|We know that normally the annual meeting be held on this weekend, Saturday 9:00 AM in Omaha.
NEUT3|But today because of the coronavirus, we couldn't go and normally I will be hosting the annual group Focus Value Conference on Thursday and Friday.
BEAR4|And it was cancelled as well for the Berkshire Annual Meeting.
NEUT5|This year will have Warren Buffett, of course.
NEUT6|And but we will be missing Charlie Munger instead of Charlie.
NEUT7|Munger will have crack a Bell.
NEUT8|Hi Greg Abbott was Avast Share Mountain nine insurance businesses, Berkshire Hathaway and we will have Becky Quick, early, Loomis and Android Source Rose Sagan asking questions.
NEUT9|It will be at 4:00 PM Eastern Time.
NEUT10|Pre meeting will start at 4:00 PM Eastern Time.
NEUT11|The Q&A will start at 4:45.
NEUT12|And this is the link to watch.
NEUT13|It's a Yahoo finance live stream video.
NEUT14|Some questions I'm interested first, of course, which is a Corona virus impact on the business Berkshire Hathaway and on the economy in general.
NEUT15|We want to hear what Warren Buffett want to see about that.
NEUT16|And 2nd is the earnings.
NEUT17|Berkshire had the operating earnings of 24 billing.
NEUT18|Also the reported earning was.
NEUT19|81 billing but mostly one billing was from the unrealized gain of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.
NEUT20|And the third is the stock purchases during the market crash in March.
BEAR21|The market lost more than 30% in March.
NEUT22|We are interested to know whether Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway bought some stocks at the time.
NEUT23|If they did what they bought.
NEUT24|And the full 4th question I'm interested is about stock buybacks.
NEUT25|Berkshire Hathaway, if we look at the chart here, this green line.
NEUT26|But we used to say that if the price book ratios of the Berkshire Hathaway stock is below 1.2, Berkshire will buy back stocks.
BEAR27|But today is a price book ratio is actually less than 1.1 due to the market crash.
BEAR28|The Berkshire stock went down quite a bit, still more than 15% down from the peak.
BEAR29|So the price book ratio is down quite a bit.
NEUT30|Also and we want to know if Berkshire spend more.
NEUT31|Money in buying back its own stocks during the first quarter.
NEUT32|That's what I'm thinking about.
NEUT33|And if you have any questions, as always, feel free to ask me in the comment area of the video and I will get back to you as much as I can and as soon as possible.
NEUT34|So again in my next video.
