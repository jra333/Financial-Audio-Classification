BEAR0|"""Melissa, this is a letter that was just sent out from American Airlines CEO Doug Parker, as well as the president of the airline Robert Isom to all the employees at the company, essentially saying that they will be issuing warning notices to 13,000 approximately 13,000 workers telling those employees that they could be laid off starting April 1st."
NEUT1|Remember the current payroll support program that was authorized by Congress?
NEUT2|It expires on March 31st.
BULL3|And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the airline business is in no better shape than it was in the fourth quarter.
BEAR4|And with American flying about 45% fewer flights an with passenger revenue down.
NEUT5|I think anywhere from 65 to 75% for the first quarter.
BULL6|They're not expecting things to improve come April, at least not immediately.
BEAR7|So as a result, they're going to have to right size their workforce.
NEUT8|We saw this with United last week.
NEUT9|We're seeing it today, with American saying that if things don't change.
NEUT10|They're going to have to issue.
BEAR11|Some layoffs come April 1st, so not a huge surprise here, Melissa.
NEUT12|And don't be surprised if you see this from other airlines as well.
BEAR13|They were American and United were the biggest in terms of furloughs and layoffs.
NEUT14|Last time around.
BEAR15|Likely will be the same this if this happens again, but other airlines are also looking at their manpower right now, saying OK if things don't improve, do we have to make some furloughs?
NEUT16|We've seen this before, of course, when the payroll program.
NEUT17|Threaten to expire, you know, back correct.
NEUT18|Back in the winter, so yeah.
NEUT19|OK, same same story.
NEUT20|Just a different date.
NEUT21|Yep, well thank you Phil about Tim.
NEUT22|Your take on American.
BEAR23|Well and again, so playing some of the political violence strings on this and and there's been a lot of criticism of the airline industry and and you know frustration again from the masses about who gets the bailout, who deserves the bailout, especially airlines that we're doing a lot of buyback.
NEUT24|Remember there's a difference between your major airline carriers in American United and DD is telling a story that's that's one of profitability by the spring.
NEUT25|Or maybe they're adjusting this, but either way, we're talking about free cash flow.
NEUT26|Even in a lower recovery trajectory, and that's where you have to really question the multiple and an EPS dynamics with American look I I think you still have issues that at least armor.
NEUT27|Remember the evolution of the airline trade since Kovid has been about balance sheet to recovery to affectively free cash flow and I'm not sure if that's three stages American might still be in stage one.
NEUT28|It's certainly not a balance sheet that I want to get behind.
NEUT29|It's a company that had to have more dilution than any of the major carriers and was a company that was more WOON.
NEUT30|Did coming into this.
NEUT31|So understand who you own and don't play them all necessarily as one trade.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
