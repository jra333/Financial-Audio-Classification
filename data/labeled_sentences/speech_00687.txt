NEUT0|"""Where, where can they get these dividends?"
NEUT1|The new widow?
NEUT2|An orphan stocks?
NEUT3|It's the tech sector.
NEUT4|But yeah it's tech is if you go back about a dozen years.com bubble patchy profits and tech contributed a very small amount of the markets.
NEUT5|Dividend payments around five years small amount of markets profits back into that is not many, but the profile of tech is really changed when you can you can just think up on screen just interrupt you there saying look at this amazing.
NEUT6|Number look at this.
BULL7|The dividend contributors to the NASDAQ 13.7% Equity Conference gone from 5% to almost 14% in around a decade, and there's not much that would be needed to make it the biggest dividend payer in the market.
NEUT8|If Google, for example, started paying a dividend around the, you know with the sort of same generosity is Apple's dividend relative to its profits, then Tech would be the largest dividend contributor and it's you know it's kind of understandable because it's the largest sector now by stock market value, but but is it also reflection, sort of?
BULL9|Also, the maturing of the tech sector that you have companies now generating such prodigious profits that they actually are paying some of them, I think, absolutely, I think the risk profile of tech has changed dramatically.
NEUT10|I mean, we can.
NEUT11|We can both remember a time when you know the business was computers and you know people sold computers and you had all the reporting world.
NEUT12|Well I am.
NEUT13|I don't know.
NEUT14|Maybe the rich family history to remember pets.com exactly and you know you think yourself well if the economy tanks no ones gonna buy computers today, you know.
NEUT15|You've got a computer in your phone.
NEUT16|You've got a computer pretty much everywhere.
NEUT17|You know our our pants will be computerized in a few years and technology is really just sort of overtaken.
NEUT18|Every corner of our lives, so the profits in other words don't depend as much.
BULL19|You know, if the economy tanks, that will still hurt tech, but Tech can continue to earn through a bad economy because it's become so necessary that I guess the stable saga.
NEUT20|That meant, maybe though, is how much of there is a worry that for some of the big tech companies like Google, like Apple, while everything is going great guns, the dividends may be assigned that.
NEUT21|Their best growth days are behind them.
NEUT22|They've just gotten so big that they can't grow the way they used to wear their best.
BEAR23|Growth days are unquestionably behind them over Apple's earnings.
NEUT24|Last night might argue contrary, but I mean, how could they not be?
NEUT25|But I'm a company gets this large.
NEUT26|It just can't continue to grow at that pace forever.
NEUT27|Apple is just a unique story of a company this large that's still growing this fast, but this is what happens when companies, when they become this big.
NEUT28|You know the growth numbers sometimes slow, but then they become enormous cash generators.
NEUT29|And then you look them for dividends.
NEUT30|So whereas in the past we look to utilities and consumer staples for our dividend yields, now increasingly.
NEUT31|People are going to be looking to technology as this sort of more stable sector that can provide them cash income right?
NEUT32|OK, and who's perhaps the next company to watch for coming out with a dividend increase or introducing a dividend?
NEUT33|Do you think?
BEAR34|I mean, I think Apple's move puts pressure on just about anyone out there who's not paying a dividend.
NEUT35|Who's sitting on some cash right now?
NEUT36|You know.
NEUT37|Certainly Google comes to mind.
NEUT38|Cisco Cisco Systems got a dividend.
BULL39|eBay maybe, but I think one thing that you can see is big dividend increases.
NEUT40|I mean I I I'm just still paying a small percentage of their profits.
BULL41|"They could afford much larger dividends and they're paying today."""
