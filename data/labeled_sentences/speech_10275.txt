NEUT0|"""Jim was to your point."
NEUT1|He's mean these are still treatments that you need to get in the hospital.
NEUT2|He happened to have been flown there in a helicopter and got the best care in the world and didn't have to pay for it.
NEUT3|'cause it was taxpayer funded.
NEUT4|So I mean the equalized that with the experience that most Americans hope to get is probably premature.
NEUT5|They just said that.
NEUT6|I mean were tested on Wednesdays here at CNBC, and George Inkopolis.
NEUT7|And look I said it on air, so it's not like it's some private conversation, he said.
NEUT8|Listen Jim, if you test positive then immediately.
NEUT9|You should be put on the regenerx on regiment.
NEUT10|That's what should happen to you.
NEUT11|But that's a perfect world.
NEUT12|Now.
NEUT13|The president happens to live in a perfect world, David.
NEUT14|Yes, he does, and this is obviously only was available to a handful of people outside of the trials that are ongoing for that regenerx on antibody cocktail.
NEUT15|And maybe you would have gotten the Perspicuously said many times.
NEUT16|He's probably one of the only people in the world may be the only one who was treated with all these different things.
BULL17|For for the virus, which by the way new cases yesterday 52,635, it's a big jump.
NEUT18|An 994 deaths, so we're still living with an.
BEAR19|Unfortunately people are still dying with this virus, Jim.
BULL20|Well, that's a number of good versus where we thought we were.
NEUT21|No, they are not, and I know that the ship last night was talking about the stadium full of people.
NEUT22|It's incredible that the NFL is frantically trying to get their players that testing.
NEUT23|Now, according to Bio Reference Labs last night.
NEUT24|Call now to test him seven days a week.
NEUT25|Why seven?
BEAR26|Well, some of us because they were shocked at what happened with Tennessee Titans.
NEUT27|Some of it is just to say hey guys, we're going to catch it.
NEUT28|You know don't you go playing around don't you go fooling around and yet then we open a stadium to 62,000 people who I'm sure are able to have some beer.
NEUT29|I don't know.
NEUT30|I mean, we're really got.
NEUT31|We've got so many different standards in this country, it's crazy.
NEUT32|Yeah, it's very true, and by the way, NFL Network this morning, a few moments ago said that another Titans player has tested positive.
NEUT33|My question for you.
NEUT34|Jim is why some of the biotech names are going higher when the president's made it pretty clear.
NEUT35|This at least this particular cocktail is going to be free.
NEUT36|That that is a great mystery to me because these are major grants that BARDA or warp speed gave to these companies an there.
NEUT37|I mean, I was telling people on Twitter please don't buy regenerx on today.
BULL38|I think we're done in amazing company and recommending since 5.
NEUT39|But when you you don't make a lot of money on a product that you sell for free and this is something I learned in the restaurant business.
NEUT40|Don't sell things for free because it didn't make any money and I think they remember they didn't get.
NEUT41|They didn't make money Carl.
NEUT42|They got paid by the government, but that's not what this is.
NEUT43|Not like that they're suddenly making you mirror the greatest selling drug of all time, or they're not making KEYTRUDA from Merck.
NEUT44|I mean, you want to maybe think more about Regenerx on because it's got good science.
BEAR45|That's fine, but it's really Dupixent.
NEUT46|It's their drug that's for all sorts of different ailments involving inflammation.
NEUT47|Did that, I think is far more important to owning the stock, and that's not.
NEUT48|That's why I asked George Yancopoulos to come back on the show today, if only just to talk about what we generally has.
NEUT49|That makes money, not just this so that people don't just go buy it.
NEUT50|Because of something that they saw the president say, hey, I feel dynamite.
NEUT51|Remember, David was very very easy 'cause he took her general.
NEUT52|Yeah right?
NEUT53|Yeah, some general yeah you did.
NEUT54|Now you know it's actually a company, right?
NEUT55|It's not like you take some agenda.
NEUT56|You don't take her job.
NEUT57|I don't know.
NEUT58|Just take two generations quotes in the morning just to take a step back.
NEUT59|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT60|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
