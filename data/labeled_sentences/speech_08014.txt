NEUT0|"""From John Sheffield, I listened to your market Foolery podcast every morning while getting ready for work."
BULL1|Thanks, John.
NEUT2|Absolutely love it.
NEUT3|He didn't have a question, I just know he goes on to write my family bought me shares of Coca Cola when I was about six months old, set it to reinvest and left it there.
BULL4|I moved it to my own trading account a few years ago and now at 23 years old it has grown to quite a large position.
NEUT5|I've been investing for a few years now with my own money, but I've never known what to do with this massive position.
NEUT6|Because that has a very low cost basis.
NEUT7|Do I sell some of it down and put it to work somewhere else?
NEUT8|Do I let it sit and continue to reinvest?
NEUT9|There's not a ton of growth opportunity, but Coca-Cola pays a nice dividend every quarter.
BULL10|Thanks and keep up the great work first of all.
NEUT11|John should be taking his family out to dinner.
NEUT12|But you know, we get a version of this question from time to time.
NEUT13|We love to see this, but it's a nice problem to have, right?
BEAR14|But it's still a problem.
NEUT15|It's still a problem, and it's a problem for a financial planner, but I'll take a shot at it if it's too big a portion of your portfolio, and it probably is at 23 years old.
NEUT16|Probably is wise to sell some of it down as you get older and put it to work and other things.
NEUT17|It doesn't have to be done immediately.
NEUT18|There's no rush.
BULL19|Coca Cola's not going anywhere as he mentions, pays a nice dividend cap, gains tax rate 15%, not too bad, not too punitive.
NEUT20|You can take it and put it.
NEUT21|You know somewhere else with that will earn you more money.
NEUT22|Hopefully then you're going to pay in taxes eventually.
NEUT23|One day.
NEUT24|You know you could.
NEUT25|You could let your heirs take that stock.
NEUT26|And this the cost basis will step up and they'll be no taxes associated with it.
NEUT27|But at 23 years old, you're probably not thinking about your heirs that much.
BULL28|Your Coca Cola certainly probably going to be continued to be one of the more stable companies that can invest in.
NEUT29|It's not going to be a high flyer, but you like.
NEUT30|Like John said, you get the reliable dividend.
NEUT31|So I think part of it is how confident are you and Coca Cola shares 5 plus years from now, but in the meantime I agree with Ron.
NEUT32|It can't hurt to sell bits and pieces selling stages as you have other ideas that you want to diversify into and quickly, I would say don't reinvest the dividends.
NEUT33|"Take the dividends in cash and put them to work in something else rather than accumulate more Coke."""
