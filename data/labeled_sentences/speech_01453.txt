NEUT0|"""And we're also learning more about the man behind the Arkos Capital Management fiasco."
NEUT1|Can we call it that the firm whose demise over the last few days is still being felt across Wall Street?
NEUT2|Leslie Picker joins us now with a look at Bill Wang and his funds.
NEUT3|Eyepopping leverage levels.
NEUT4|Andrew, I think we can call it a fiasco, especially as you mentioned, we're learning more about what exactly happened and its ripple effects.
NEUT5|Bill Huang flew a little too close to the Sun by taking on an insatiable amount of risk.
BEAR6|He grew his Archegos Capital Management into an investing whale, but when several positions turned against him, it didn't take much to tip his firm into turmoil, causing 10s of billions of dollars in forced selling.
BEAR7|Now the risk levels here and defied logic.
NEUT8|I spoke with several hedge fund managers who said.
NEUT9|They could not fathom that type of tolerance.
NEUT10|The Financial Times reported that banks were lending to archegos at ratios as high as eight to one, citing people familiar with the matter.
BEAR11|the FT added that in some trades ratios were as high as 20 to one.
BEAR12|That means that it would take just a very small move downward in a name to wipe out the whole position.
NEUT13|Now it's also reported that he ran a book that was heavily concentrated as well as illiquid a spokesman.
BEAR14|Spokeswoman for the firm telling CNBC quote this is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos Capital Management.
NEUT15|Our partners, an employees, all plans are being discussed as Mr Huang and the team determined the best path forward.
NEUT16|Archegos is a family office, meaning it's not in the business of managing money for outside institutions like pension funds, endowment funds, nonprofits, things like that as a hedge fund would that could be partially why Huang's risk appetite was so high.
NEUT17|Andrew.
NEUT18|So, So what happens next?
NEUT19|The fun.
BEAR20|How much money do we think he's lost himself?
NEUT21|We haven't really calculated that, have we?
NEUT22|Yeah, and there's no way actually to know there are no real SEC filings to try and kind of piece together information on him and how big the fund really was.
NEUT23|There was a Reuters report that said he managed about $10 billion, but that his exposure, including leverage, was something closer to $50 billion, so it's impossible to really know how much of that was his money specifically.
NEUT24|Maybe some of it was friends and family, other employees at the Fund, so it's really difficult to tell at this point, but it's clear that, especially at this funds peak, he was.
NEUT25|Just producing tremendous returns, absolutely billionaire status, so it's it's unclear if he still remains.
NEUT26|You know, at those levels, or you know, significantly lower.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
