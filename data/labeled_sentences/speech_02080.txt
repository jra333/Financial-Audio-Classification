BULL0|"""If you think about Coke, they've challenged to grow their top line for a number of years."
BULL1|And since James Quincy is taken over, you started to see that top line steadily improve and 5% organic growth is pretty remarkable in this environment for consumer Staples Company, we're also going to find this growth, and I'm also wondering what areas are you most concerned about?
NEUT2|Also, because even though they are the rising costs or an indirect cost to them, indirect impact, you know we heard from GM, for instance, that a bulk of their rising costs, or the 1 billion.
NEUT3|Extra they're seeing this year is some currency exposure.
NEUT4|Forex.
NEUT5|Yeah, it's a funny thing.
BEAR6|Historically when currencies go against Coke, they actually have to lower numbers and this is one of the very few times that I've seen covering the stock a very long time where numbers are actually going up.
NEUT7|So I think this shows that this is a very new company, a very different company than we're normally accustomed to.
BULL8|They have a much more aggressive tact and cost cutting and they are managing their top line much better and they're navigating the environment much better.
NEUT9|So what worries me is.
NEUT10|Just geopolitical issues, right?
BEAR11|You had a trucker strike in Brazil.
NEUT12|You have turmoil in the Middle East.
NEUT13|You have a sugar tax in South Africa.
BEAR14|Those very small discrete issues can add up if it all hits in the same quarter.
NEUT15|So those are the things that I worry about when it comes to Coca Cola.
NEUT16|Is this your best idea in the sector?
NEUT17|It's my favorite Mega cap idea, so when you think about Procter and Gamble, Colgate, Kimberly, Clark, PepsiCo, Coke has been our preferred mega Cap name for the last year.
NEUT18|You're asking about Diet Coke on the conference.
NEUT19|Call Nick.
NEUT20|What are you worried about there?
NEUT21|What are you looking for?
BULL22|Well Diet Coke has been under a lot of pressure and the trends have been very good.
NEUT23|So what I was trying to understand from the management team is is this really just distribution newproducts getting put into the retail outlets or is this really a function of consumers coming back to the dock with the new flavors or Diet Coke?
NEUT24|Yeah, they relaunched new flavors in slim cans and I guess what we're seeing is new.
BULL25|Consumers are coming into the franchise and even old lapse consumers are coming back to Diet Coke, so that's a very positive sign.
NEUT26|I've tried them.
NEUT27|I like them.
NEUT28|They got some pretty neat flavors.
NEUT29|Her blood orange, and now they're going into the UK.
NEUT30|I just like the slim cans.
NEUT31|Yeah, I can't drink a whole can of Coke anymore though they are the ones who write their boomer.
