NEUT0|"""You know it's not controversial how controversial Bitcoin really is, given that we have seen the stimulus package being signed."
NEUT1|Those checks going out.
NEUT2|How much further does this rally have to run?
NEUT3|So Heidi, well, that's the I don't know that the $1,000,000 question when it comes to Bitcoin.
BULL4|It has been on a stunning rally and you know what?
NEUT5|We're seeing what we've seen over the weekend.
NEUT6|It is that it has been caught up in this, you know, sort of by everything but mentem.
NEUT7|If you like following that stimulus package in the US.
NEUT8|Also, you know more confidence about the economy with you know with the vaccines being rolled out.
NEUT9|An interesting Lee enough.
NEUT10|Apparently, Bitcoin now is equivalent to.
NEUT11|35 ounces of gold.
NEUT12|Now that's about twice as much as it was at the beginning of the year, so it just shows you how spectacular this rally has been has been.
NEUT13|I mean, look.
BULL14|One of the reason is that it is getting increasing institutional interest, and you know, an attention.
NEUT15|No, it it's you know, champions of Bitcoin seed as an increasingly as a store of value akin to gold.
NEUT16|If you like, you know that can act as a hedge against inflation, and we know that it is inflationary.
NEUT17|Concerns are now out there and also against a weaker dollar, so you know they're also, you know, they're also pointing out to heat being different to the last boom and bust in Bitcoin.
NEUT18|Because of this, why their uptake with you know Tesla's $1.8 billion investment Elon Musk endorsing it.
NEUT19|And also investors like like Mike Novogratz, one of the biggest proponents of Bitcoin and digital coins.
NEUT20|Saying that, it could reach $100,000 by the end of the year.
NEUT21|So at this stage look is anyone's guess, I guess so.
BULL22|An incredible rally also for Cardo.
NEUT23|Know what's the story there?
NEUT24|Yeah, look that's right.
NEUT25|That's cardano.
NEUT26|The reason that that's sort of in the headlines, I guess right now is because its market value recently searched a 34 billion that place it behind Bitcoin and Ethereum as the third biggest cryptocurrency.
BULL27|And again, it's caught the eye of investors like like Mike Novogratz loyal following on Reddit.
BEAR28|But look, there are still issues with with this particular digital coin, it network lacks many of the functionality's available on more established rivals.
NEUT29|"But look one explanation for the sudden interest in Cardano is is that it is an alternative to Ethereum possibly."""
