NEUT0|"""There's always deadlines and you know our deadline is as a rocket launching, so you can't really miss that."
NEUT1|There's a lot of hard work and a lot of 20 hour days that go into that, and there's people right now in the clean room building satellites that you're not going to go home very early this evening, probably.
NEUT2|I'm your income part from Spire Global, one of the founders there and I'm 27 years old Spire.
NEUT3|Global is a data services company with space based data as a source.
NEUT4|So what we used for that as a constellation of nanosatellites so the satellites are kind of wine bottle size satellites.
NEUT5|If you think of them as porcupine with solar panels and wings on it, a lot of antenna sticking out, that kind of thing.
NEUT6|We don't do imagery.
NEUT7|Everything we do is RF spectrum based.
NEUT8|Can we listen to radio waves really?
NEUT9|And they can range to a variety of variety of things.
NEUT10|You can listen to things that are transmitting on the Earth.
NEUT11|You could look at other satellites.
NEUT12|You can look at GPS satellites you can listen to ships.
NEUT13|I think.
NEUT14|What is it?
NEUT15|80 or 90% of the world's global trade is ships for container ships on the ocean.
NEUT16|So if you have knowledge about where all that happens, you can have a huge impact on all kinds of different industries, all kinds of different people.
NEUT17|Back when I was 14-16 or something, start playing guitar and then you buy these guitar effect pedal.
NEUT18|You were really expensive so start building them myself.
NEUT19|There's a lot of soldering the wires and all that kind of stuff and then finally went to college to kind of do the same thing there.
NEUT20|Learn more about it or more about their components and how you really build systems.
NEUT21|Today I love technology about getting my hands dirty and soldering wires and poking at things with probes.
NEUT22|"If you're not having fun doing it, you're not going to be able to keep doing it especially early on when it's 20 hour days."""
