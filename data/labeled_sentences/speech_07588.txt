BULL0|"""Apple has breached a major support here and it's done it on strong volume."
NEUT1|Why do I not see another area of support?
NEUT2|Partly because this huge run up, which I call the line of exuberance.
BEAR3|It's really not helping us in terms of finding a next level of support.
NEUT4|We really need to see what Apple is going to do in the next short to mid term.
NEUT5|What kind of pattern is it going to create this line of support is gone.
NEUT6|We don't have a pattern right now.
NEUT7|We need to wait for a clear pattern.
NEUT8|To help us decide is it going to continue an uptrend?
NEUT9|If you were very aggressive on Apple, you could buy anytime you want because clearly there has been an upside established in this range.
NEUT10|Up here, you know, $144.
BEAR11|Right now we're down to 117.
NEUT12|That's a lot of upside.
NEUT13|You would really need to be all in on Apple.
NEUT14|You really need to know that you are super bullish on Apple matter.
NEUT15|What the market is doing, no matter what Apple is doing.
NEUT16|That's not me.
NEUT17|Eric and I are very conservative.
NEUT18|We want a clear pattern before we invest.
NEUT19|"Stay tuned and we'll give you more information on our next update."""
