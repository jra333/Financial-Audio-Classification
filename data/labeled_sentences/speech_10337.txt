NEUT0|"""Will start the gym with this story that we do expect to get more detail on later on today and that Merck is that is that Merck is going to help JNJ make the vaccine."
BULL1|Washington Post helped break the story this morning, says the White House helped broker this arrangement and that if it is at peak production, it could double what J&J was going to do on its own right.
BULL2|I'm glad to hear that because I had felt the changes combined amount that they're going to put out with emergent bio.
NEUT3|Which one of the biggest stock gainers yesterday was far bigger than what they announced and?
NEUT4|I know some people were saying Jim you thought they were going to a billion and I still do, but this is really terrific because what you were getting Burke helping out.
BULL5|I wouldn't be surprised if more don't help out is a recognition that we're going to beat this thing and we're going to beat it much faster because of the how the scientists and the drug companies have been willing to work together in a remarkable way.
BULL6|And don't forget their Sputnik, which is doing quite well Russia that's selling it over many different places.
NEUT7|AstraZeneca is being used.
NEUT8|So the J&J David if others would join.
NEUT9|Can you imagine don't get too big yeah, listen.
BULL10|I mean, we're going to get to 400,000,000 doses available, which is obviously more than the population.
NEUT11|Even even double counting as you need to with Pfizer and Moderna change.
NEUT12|Obviously one does.
NEUT13|You know, by the summer I think of having discussed it with Meg Tirrell who we go to for all things vaccine related gym.
NEUT14|So then the question becomes rest of the world which you also need to vaccinate.
NEUT15|Could take some time but perhaps that gets there more quickly enabling.
NEUT16|You know a lot more travel, for example, and things of that nature.
NEUT17|Well look, it's very important to remember that the J&J vaccine is like flu vaccine.
NEUT18|It can go anywhere, and David, you know if you don't need refrigeration, well, let's just send it everywhere.
BULL19|And I think that we're going to find ourselves traveling.
NEUT20|I think Carl, one of these things is going to happen is you're going to carry your card.
NEUT21|I don't know what kind of car they're going to give you, but I feel very strongly that you're going to have a pass, and that pass is going to say you can come in and it will be very important.
NEUT22|Because I think that when you go to restaurant right now, they take your temperature, which we know exactly has very little correlation with.
BULL23|The disease passes much better an I think it will change life dramatically.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
