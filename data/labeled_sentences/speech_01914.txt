BEAR1|Chain Link is holding tight to the uptrend after the recent rejection at the all time high.
BULL2|Defending support above $20 played a crucial role in rejuvenating the ongoing uptrend.
NEUT3|Link is dancing at $28.00.
NEUT4|At the time of writing as bulls pushed for gains beyond $30.
BEAR5|On the other hand, on chain metrics suggests that chain link is on the verge of a massive breakout.

NEUT7|Network growth remains one of the critical factors used to understand cryptocurrency projects and their price action.
BULL8|According to sentiment, new addresses joined Chainlinks protocol have rallied incredibly in the past few weeks.
BULL9|Links network growth has improved consistently from roughly 2400 addresses per day in November to approximately 6700.
BULL10|On February 9th, representing a 64% rise in 90 days.
BULL11|This growth occurred alongside the surge in price.
BULL12|Therefore, if it continues, chain link could be on the road to massive all time highs.
BULL13|Chain Link recently broke out of an ascending triangle, suggesting that it was ready for a 38% upswing to $35.

NEUT15|The breakout takes place above the X axis, currently working as support.
BULL16|In the meantime, the bullish narrative has been validated by the Relative Strength Index RSI on the four hour chart.

BEAR21|Therefore the token is at the risk of losses, mostly due to holders selling to profit.
NEUT22|For instance, the Holder distribution by sentiment shows that the whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 link have begun offloading their tokens dot from February 3rd.
BEAR23|These addresses have dropped from 283 to 265, representing a 6.4% decline.
