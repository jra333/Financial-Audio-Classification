NEUT1|And I just wonder from your perspective for you right now, do you watch the 10 year Treasury auction tomorrow?
NEUT2|30 years on Thursday?
NEUT3|Is that what you have to do in your job now?
BULL4|Yeah, I mean look I I just view it that a 40 bit move in the 10 year doesn't change our multi year bull thesis on tap and I think we're going into a Golden age for cloud cyber security 5G in the fandom.

NEUT6|It's a pound table moment.
