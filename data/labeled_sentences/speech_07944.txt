BULL0|"""Good evening everybody to scare with some *** investments."
NEUT1|Company guys with a breakdown on zoom so those of you who caught my last zoom video or if you haven't watched it yet, maybe you should go give it a check.
NEUT2|We got this almost to dissent.
NEUT3|I have not moved to things so you guys can back check me on this.
BULL4|This is literally the level that I had three 8750 little scared that someone's watching me at this point, but nonetheless we hit our target.
NEUT5|But we have what could end up being a really, really big fakeout, so I'm going to go ahead and delete this.
NEUT6|So we can get a better idea of what's going on here so.
NEUT7|This mark here three 9325.
BEAR8|That's where I'm expecting a rejection.
NEUT9|That's where I'm possibly going to take out a short.
NEUT10|If if, if if the volume is low on this breakout.
BEAR11|So if I see that we have low volume and this like this macdee starting to lose strength, then I'm going to be looking at taking a short position so.
BEAR12|If we go and do a little projection here so there's a couple different routes now, there's a lot of shutdowns going on.
NEUT13|Zoom is talking about they got new technology, they're expanding.
NEUT14|That's all good news, but I still feel that for the company that they are, they're overvalued, and those things aren't tangibles, or are they don't have any real plans, or that I mean, well, let me not word it that way, but.
NEUT15|The plans are in place, yet like they haven't done those things, so as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't matter quite yet.
NEUT16|But we into investor sentiment is number one.
NEUT17|So how I feel about it doesn't matter.
NEUT18|We gotta play the chart, that's why.
NEUT19|Yeah, I'm bears on zoom.
BULL20|But I've also called this balance right off of this support an I figured from there we would end up seeing this resistance and we've literally are there.
NEUT21|So now I'm waiting in am expecting this rejection of 232-9325.
BULL22|And if we end up breaking to the upside due to positive sentiment, then the target there is 470.
NEUT23|25 at least within a couple of days, maybe Monday.
NEUT24|But as vaccines and everything kind of you know, are becoming widely distributed, those things could end up not mattering, and we might reject that level if we do reject that level.
BULL25|I'm going to be adding to my short position at 375 at the break of 375, and we may see it bounce back up to 381.
NEUT26|I would be looking to take and we will have these.
NEUT27|Moving average kind of curling over there as well.
NEUT28|But this 50 day moving average will be right about there at two 365.
NEUT29|So just watch out for that level as well so 365 and then maybe a little bounce back up and then a continuation to the downside so.
NEUT30|Was there to my two projections?
NEUT31|Volume is going to be really indicative on whether we break to the upside it made for a really nice day trade, but as far as like taking a leap out on zoom, I just as anybody else need to see.
NEUT32|More sentiment from investors.
NEUT33|An just zoom coming out with something a little bit more tangible than what they're offering now.
