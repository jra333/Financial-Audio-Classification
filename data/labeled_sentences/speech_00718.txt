NEUT1|Make sure you guys leave a comment below.
NEUT2|Let me know if you're also looking at Tesla like the video, and hit that subscribe button.
NEUT3|If you are new.
NEUT4|My name is will my Instagram is at will dot knowledge so check it out and let's get into the video.
NEUT5|So today we're talking about Tesla ticker symbol TFLA.
NEUT6|I did make a video yesterday on Tesla.
NEUT7|If you haven't solid, I'll kind of reiterate what I said.
NEUT8|I said I didn't want price below 610.
BEAR9|It dropped down here by 6:10, but it quickly rejected it, so I was still bullish.
NEUT10|I said as long as it stays above 610, I will be bullish.
NEUT11|But if it fell below 610, would it like a decent type of drop?
NEUT12|Then I would not have played Tesla, but it stayed above 610 and my entry price was 6:20.
NEUT13|So I said if on this day it went to 6:20, I would enter.
NEUT14|So as you can see this first, this is a 15 minute chart by the way.
NEUT15|I'll get in closer as you can see, this is the 1st 15 minutes of the day it opened up at 6:28, so I wasn't in yet.
NEUT16|I said I wanted a 629 at 6:28, so open higher.
NEUT17|So I wasn't going to buy in just on 'cause it was already high.
BEAR18|I wanted to wait, it did drop.
NEUT19|And look at the low, the lowest 619.5.
BEAR20|So I was $0.50 off.
NEUT21|Uh, well, almost had it perfect.
NEUT22|I did enter at the 6:20 when it went to 619 as you could see at the top where it says the low it was 619.5.
BULL23|I entered on that on the 6:20 mark I entered and I have caught this run up so now.
BULL24|I am waiting for it to break this high.
NEUT25|That's what that line is for.
BULL26|I'm waiting for it to break that high and I'm also took.
NEUT27|I also took profits so when I bought down here pretty much caught the big move of the morning.
NEUT28|So I did take about 60% profit off.
NEUT29|Of my option, I bought 7 contracts so I took away 4 contracts so I have about 3 Contacts left.
NEUT30|So whether I lose all the money on those contracts or not, I would this would.
NEUT31|This would still be a win play for me, so I'm pretty much not too worried about it.
NEUT32|So if it drops tomorrow, it's really whatever.
BULL33|And but I am waiting for it to break this high and also go to 700.
NEUT34|That's when I will whenever it says hi, I'll take off one contract.
NEUT35|I'll have two left and then 700.
NEUT36|I will take off the rest of the two contracts, but if it doesn't reach that high I'll still be holding three contracts an if it breaks a 620 level tomorrow and it starts dropping down, I'll go ahead and close this position for a profit.
NEUT37|So that is the update on my Tesla play and my Tesla.
NEUT38|I'll make another update tomorrow on my contracts.
NEUT39|How many I'm holding in my exit and entry prices and what I've seen the market for Tesla.
BULL40|I do think Tesla would be a really good stock in the future.
NEUT41|They just been blowing up as a company and I think they'll be at a way higher price target and 600.
NEUT42|He might even do another stock split on pretty sure 'cause the stock will be so high.
NEUT43|But that's for the future so I'll just let you know.
NEUT44|My levels in my option play today I have a update for you guys tomorrow.
NEUT45|Just remember none of this is a recommendation bar so anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT46|Do not trade anything you see or hear on these videos.
NEUT47|I've catch on the next one.
NEUT48|"Bye."""
