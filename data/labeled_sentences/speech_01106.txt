NEUT0|"""Is the historic relationship between Golden interest rates, specifically the 10 year note working?"
NEUT1|My answer is yes.
BEAR2|We've seen 10 year note yields get as low as the point 5.6 area and gold is hit $2000.00 an ounce.
BULL3|Its all time high.
NEUT4|So to argue that they're not the inverse relationship at work would not work.
NEUT5|If you're really looking at the facts, the problem that the Fed is going to have is how do they get the economy to re inflate?
NEUT6|If it re inflates, does gold go with that or not?
NEUT7|Now the Fed could care less about gold.
NEUT8|What they do want to see though is inflation.
NEUT9|Grab hold and in order for that to happen they will keep interest rates low.
NEUT10|Therefore, does gold have a bright future ahead of it?
BULL11|"I think it does, just not as bright as some might think, but I do think higher prices down the horizon are still there as interest rates stay relatively low."""
