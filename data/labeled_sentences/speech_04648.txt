NEUT0|"""It's calling this via video chart on ticker symbol YVR."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT3|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT4|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance, an overall, a tricky chart to look at because to be fair, it was a good day.
NEUT5|I mean, just on Tuesday, the price was there and now it's up above where it was, but also to think that at one point the price was there and then there.
NEUT6|And then there was this big old pull back here.
BEAR7|So there is definitely a lot of bearishness out there too.
NEUT8|So it's really just kind of question.
NEUT9|Is this a bullish or bearish sharp?
NEUT10|And that's all going to be in my mind at least.
BEAR11|Dictated by this level, down here at $3.80.
NEUT12|Why is $3.80 a helpful area?
NEUT13|And I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanations.
NEUT14|Like if the price were to come down to 380 behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT15|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it just broke out of.
NEUT16|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power choose strength.
NEUT17|But to be fair, no price can just go straight up either.
NEUT18|So yeah, pullbacks happen, so if the price were to come down there behave in that manner then start to curl upwards.
NEUT19|Now all of a sudden what you have?
NEUT20|Well, there would actually be a pretty big difference because you have a set of those.
NEUT21|There you have these loads down there, and if you envision those is there steps, well now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's what it truly strong moves going to.
NEUT22|It's going to make progress, so really that 380 ish mark is serving as our dictionary.
NEUT23|If you will, meaning it's helping define is the price, quote, unquote, going back to where it was that associated with bearishness?
NEUT24|Or is the price quote unquote?
NEUT25|Making progress that associated with bullishness?
NEUT26|So in my mind, that's the key level to watch moving forward, so let's see how this one continues to play out relative to that 380 mark.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
