NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my kernel here Co founder patron Partners on Bob Iaccino."
BEAR1|So Tesla turned bearish mode actually held up surprisingly well given the major sell off in the markets, but still down and now in bearish mode.
NEUT2|So it's bearish mode on the one hour bearish men on the four hour bearish mode on the daily.
NEUT3|The only thing left in bullish mode is on the weekly.
NEUT4|We're still going to watch for it closes this week, but right now it is within the weekly rotation zone.
NEUT5|Generally, if things close within the rotation zone, you can continue to expect a bigger pullback, not guaranteed, but that's what we're going to be watching for, and that's a weekly close, so let's see what we're watching for tomorrow on any rally.
NEUT6|Our first level of resistance is now about four 1650.
BEAR7|And then major resistance coming in about 424.
BEAR8|Now you can see we closed below this swing low on the four hour chart.
NEUT9|Our levels are still in the same 407 cents, so 400 and three 9276.
NEUT10|Those are the key levels below.
NEUT11|Uh.
BEAR12|In the rotations on daily, just looking at that we have 424 which dips into slightly in the rotation zone.
NEUT13|You can start watching for some resistance about 4:22, but I'm really going to focus on 424 again.
BULL14|For a continued really good rally, we need to close about four 2575 zeroing in on the 50 day exponential.
NEUT15|But there's not just looking.
BEAR16|It's still in this major congestion pattern.
NEUT17|There's not a lot of support.
BEAR18|If we did drop through three 9276, three 8566 is next level than three 7250.
NEUT19|Going to keep again.
NEUT20|This video.
NEUT21|Short and sweet, there's not much else to talk about, so we'll talk to everyone later.
NEUT22|"Bye for now."""
