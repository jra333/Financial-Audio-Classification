BULL0|"""More than expected or what you were expecting?"
NEUT1|And is this game changing for the industry or just incrementally positive?
BULL2|Well, for it it's a start.
NEUT3|OK so I think what today this the significance is we have the beginning of a national policy in the United States that can support renewable transportation.
NEUT4|Frankly, that's probably the most important thing.
NEUT5|174 billion.
NEUT6|You know, that could buy a couple dozen, maybe 30-40 giga factories to make batteries, but it's just a drop in the bucket.
NEUT7|I mean, wake me up at, you know, a couple trillion.
NEUT8|We might need a couple trill.
NEUT9|Just just for EB's over the next decade, so it's a start, but there's a lot of unanswered questions from here.
NEUT10|It gets gritty, it gets dirty, we got questions about grid integrity, storage affordability, right?
NEUT11|Yeah, how we pay for this stuff you throw in a MW and back of a Starbucks parking lot.
NEUT12|I mean, there's there's a lot of devil in the details.
BULL13|It's a nice start.
BULL14|Let's build from here so it doesn't make sense to Adam that the EV stocks are getting a boost off the back of this.
NEUT15|Or, or not necessarily yet.
NEUT16|Look in a market like this shirt.
NEUT17|Yeah, people are trading headlines.
NEUT18|OK, it's a different discussion.
NEUT19|Sure right there was.
NEUT20|I'd say there was a bit of a vacuum of expectations of what we really could come out of this and a lot of the progress we've made in the United States on EV adoption has been in spite of not really having a cohesive policy.
NEUT21|And so it's all additive.
NEUT22|Will you got me?
NEUT23|But I think you know where.
NEUT24|How do we really get it done?
NEUT25|I mean, I, I think that.
NEUT26|You know those questions about gasoline tax?
NEUT27|That clearly ain't gonna work.
NEUT28|So then there's discussions about vehicle miles traveled and we think that governments eventually you're going to go after fleets and work with shared mobility fleets, final Mile logistics, things like that.
NEUT29|So it's a it's a nice start, but there's a. I think there's some risk that yes, some of the stock price moves.
NEUT30|Could this be a knee jerk reaction?
NEUT31|And over we need to kind of be a bit more.
NEUT32|Cautious about how this pans out overtime.
BULL33|Charge point is up 20%.
NEUT34|They do the Chargers.
NEUT35|There's always been this question Adam about.
NEUT36|The EV future, I mean the question is consumers right?
NEUT37|Are they not here because we don't have the infrastructure and therefore building the infrastructure like charging stations and what the government plans to do will bring the consumers or not.
NEUT38|'cause that's the missing link which is pretty important.
BULL39|I I totally agree.
NEUT40|I think it's a great point and if you look back at up a lot of big innovations in the United States that had taxpayer help first, it wasn't just taxpayers, there was a lot of capitalism involved in this too.
NEUT41|And so you know the United States probably has to be turned into a dam construction site.
NEUT42|And we might have the biggest public private partnership in the history of business here, right?
NEUT43|In the US, you know, that's what that's the kind of stuff we're going to need to bring, electrification and all the problems it's going to create?
NEUT44|You know, some ESG problems along the way to really see it through, so, so yeah.
NEUT45|I mean, you know you you mentioned some of these names.
NEUT46|I think an interesting discussion.
NEUT47|I think I think where there's a big blind spot is it's not really going to be retail like you and me.
BULL48|That's driving the Delta 20 or 30% penetration.
NEUT49|It's going to be business is it's going to be, you know, tech companies.
NEUT50|I won't name a specific names that because they bring stuff to your door.
NEUT51|Have an enormous impact on the environment and have a very large, maybe shockingly large carbon footprint.
BULL52|And they are in a position to benefit from that infrastructure to leverage the taxpayer dollar and and two.
NEUT53|Decarbonize a lot faster than waiting for people to use a charging station.
NEUT54|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT55|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
