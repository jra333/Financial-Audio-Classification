BEAR0|"""Hello everyone, just just Netflix earning came out after hour and we can see the Netflix stock crash like crazy like you went down like $50 down is like 347 now is like 12% down."
BEAR1|That is creating saying like is so bad it looking so ugly and they they miss the estimated subscriber.
BULL2|The subscriber didn't grow as the analyst was expected.
BEAR3|And it looks so ugly right now.
NEUT4|We can see if you go to chart you can see the after hour charge like is from from 400 for 400 to wind down to 342.
NEUT5|And now it's 347 up.
NEUT6|He's gonna, it's gonna it's gonna look nasty when when the market gonna open tomorrow morning when the regular trader will be able to buy and sell, they'll be selling the stock like a crazy.
BEAR7|I think tomorrow or next week is gonna be so bad for Netflix like.
NEUT8|I was kind of.
NEUT9|I thought like it might gonna happen because you know, like the price price is so high for Netflix.
BEAR10|He's stuck like look at the price, earning ratio is 266.
NEUT11|Am I going to buy this stock in this deep now?
NEUT12|Because you know why these stock is?
BEAR13|Extremely overvalued like she might not gonna agree with me.
BEAR14|You are welcome to disagree with me.
NEUT15|I can be wrong.
BEAR16|It can be right, but the but this share is like these two is extremely extremely overvalued out.
NEUT17|Not touch this stuff.
NEUT18|Like if it's like $200 range.
NEUT19|I would probably buy it but like he still 347 is still is still overvalued up.
NEUT20|I would never buy this stock like in at this price because you know like and their subscriber is not going.
NEUT21|That as much as they expect it, I don't.
NEUT22|I think it's already reaches top limit like top potential, I don't.
NEUT23|I don't think it's going to grow from.
NEUT24|I don't think it's going to grow crazy from now at this point, but I think it is already.
NEUT25|Ceiling is in the top, so I don't think they don't have any anything extra or anything like setting to offer so it can grow like crazy.
NEUT26|Crazy amount and next year when the Disney going to start streaming, they're going to.
NEUT27|Bring all the Disney movies.
NEUT28|All the Marvel movie and all the all the content and you know it's not going to be easy for Netflix even from the next year.
NEUT29|He's going to face really big competition.
NEUT30|So am I going to buy now?
NEUT31|I'm, I think like it's a good bank point, I don't think so because he tomorrow or next week is going to be so bad.
NEUT32|That's that's, I think.
NEUT33|But I could be wrong.
NEUT34|You know, you never know what market going to happen.
NEUT35|What's gonna happen?
NEUT36|And yeah.
NEUT37|"Alright, so that's what it is."""
