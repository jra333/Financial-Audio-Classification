BULL0|"""Now, though, those are slightly lower as well."
BULL1|After announcing a secondary offering, but the stock is up nearly 50% in the last month alone.
NEUT2|Josh is over at the Telestrator with a special edition of trade school.
NEUT3|Yeah, I'm gonna get a secondary offerings.
BULL4|This has been a once in a lifetime rally for the EV stocks and I think they need to strike while the iron is hot.
NEUT5|That's what's important right now, and so I think there are a few key points that's worth bringing up, the first being CFO's are better sellers of stock.
NEUT6|Then you are.
NEUT7|Tesla and Nio are both sellers this week in the secondary market, meal will be raising $1.3 billion cash and they were doing that effectively in two different buckets, 650,000,000 in a convertible do 2026 and that one pays no interest whatsoever, 650,000,000 in a 2027 convertible.
NEUT8|Those codes are paying 50 basis points, so there are effectively almost raising money for free.
NEUT9|All there is is the dilution to worry about.
BULL10|And those convert by the way, over $93.00 a share, which is a 50% premium to where NEO is now.
NEUT11|So I think what that tells you Neo is very good at announcing new models, new cars, new products, or they as good at shipping them.
NEUT12|Not quite yet.
NEUT13|They sold about 7000 cars in December 40, 3000.
NEUT14|Cars in all of last year.
NEUT15|So they have to build more.
NEUT16|And to do that you need cash.
NEUT17|So if you're a shareholder, don't worry about the dilution.
NEUT18|This is what you want to see happen.
NEUT19|Anyways, it's a lot of money.
NEUT20|Build out capacity, do it on incredibly company friendly terms, and I think that's what separates these types of secondaires from the ones historically, where you would worry more about shareholder.
NEUT21|The delusion in this case.
NEUT22|Now you need the cash you need to make some cars.
NEUT23|Let's go to Rick in the bond market.
NEUT24|Rick Santelli is tracking the action at the CME.
NEUT25|Rick, how are you?
BULL26|"Great job."""
