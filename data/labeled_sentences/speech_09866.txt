NEUT5|Let's get into the video.
BEAR6|First off, Apple outperformed the broader markets today, even though it was down slightly .46%.
NEUT7|To $135 and the latest news from Apple is Apple has partnered with TSMC to develop Micro Ole D displays or AR devices.
BULL8|Apple has partnered with Taiwan Consumer Doctor Manufacturing Company to develop micro OLED displays, which it plans to use and its upcoming augmented reality devices.
NEUT9|Apple is.
NEUT10|Collaborating with TSMC, these sole supplier of iPhone processors as micro Ole displays are far thinner, smaller and use less power, making them more suitable for use in wearable AR devices.
NEUT11|Wearable AR devices from Apple.
NEUT12|What does Apple have up their sleeves that we're not Privy to know just yet?
NEUT13|Hopping onto the stock chart Apple.
BEAR14|Over the past few days since Friday has been in a very defined descending trading channel where it's making these lower lows and lower highs.
NEUT15|Oddly enough, Apple has stopped right here on this dotted Gray line, and if we go out a little bit, this dotted Gray line has acted as a support trendline for Apple, starting all the way back.
NEUT16|November 1st of 2020, and since then this line has been acting as a support line.
BEAR17|The stock has only gone below this trendline one time, and that was back in mid January and when it went below that it it bounced right back up.
NEUT18|So it's curious to see what's going to happen to Apple now that it's found itself on this trimline.
NEUT19|Well, a couple of things could happen.
BEAR20|Number one is Apple is losing some momentum.
BEAR21|It could fall back to his support line of $130 if it falls to that support line, that's a 10% discount from Apple's all time high that it made back on the 26th of January.
BEAR22|Set your stock alert for $130 is Apple Falls below that price point.
BULL23|You've got a good buying opportunity.
NEUT24|For Apple now another thing Apple could do is Apple could start to consolidate along this line.
BULL25|This trend line, and if it does that then it's going to start building up momentum impressor or either an upward push or a downward push.
NEUT26|The third possibility is that Apple bounces off of this trend line and goes up so will follow this closely will make another video shortly to let you know.
