BULL0|"""ADP as we mentioned are pretty strong."
BULL1|Not quite as strong as estimates, but it is the best number since September again leading to some suspicions of strength around Jobs Friday in a couple of days and then you got infrastructure.
NEUT2|A lot of details starting to come out about promises for EV charging stations.
NEUT3|Nationwide, retrofitting homes, universal affordable broadband by I think it's 20-30.
NEUT4|What do we think is the thinking right now Jim, that this is inflationary?
BEAR5|Going to overheat the economy.
NEUT6|Or is this as the White House said this morning, on squawk an historic opportunity to invest in a country where we're #13 around the world in an infrastructure spend?
NEUT7|Well, former President Trump used to talk all the time about what a second rate.
NEUT8|Infrastructure we had in the country versus China.
NEUT9|I think that the wrap this time is let's wait and see because we're putting so much money into the economy and the lot of the stimulus was based on the fact that we would never have this kind of vaccination rate.
NEUT10|So I think there may be people who want to say, wait and see when I look at the at the package of what people of what the President wants.
NEUT11|It's very little of it seems to actually be towards a bridge is we don't make purchases in this country for the most part we stopped making bridge steel long time at Bethlehem Steel.
NEUT12|I think they're turning that into an RH and spin it casino.
NEUT13|I so I don't know how much I don't want people to go out and buy these stocks.
NEUT14|I've been saying if you want to be involved by Nucor by Martin Marietta materials and by Vulcan Materials, the last two are aggregate companies.
NEUT15|Why 'cause their business is great to begin with.
NEUT16|So if you don't get any infrastructure you're going to do really, really well when you see something like rural broadband, you're not going to make any money off of it.
NEUT17|When you see some of the of the policies that they want to where they're giving better care for individuals, you're not going to make any money on it.
NEUT18|There is something in there for building up fabs.
NEUT19|It very difficult to do now that Intel said that they would have built fast, so I don't know.
NEUT20|I find that it's too much of a pastiche.
NEUT21|They better figure a better theme.
NEUT22|I really want to know the theme here, 'cause it seems very scattershot.
NEUT23|Yeah, Pelosi is talking about passage.
NEUT24|She hopes by the 4th of July.
NEUT25|I did notice a Cleveland Cliffs EBIT DA Guide this morning.
BULL26|Jim better than expected, got some steel names with a bit of a tailwind.
NEUT27|This morning is an interesting piece out of Tom Friedman in the Times this morning, talking about how we're supposed to think about government support and his general view.
NEUT28|And maybe you agree, maybe you don't.
NEUT29|Is that the government comes in and helps at least lower the price of these new innovations that allows companies to come in.
NEUT30|With a profit centric motive and sell the way capitalism is supposed to work well, look at that.
NEUT31|That's the way it works in other countries better than our country.
NEUT32|For instance, South Korea is deeply committed to clean hydrogen clean hydrogen is uneconomic.
NEUT33|We can say we're committed to clean hygiene, but not putting money on it.
NEUT34|And so it's not going to scale in this country.
NEUT35|It's going to be up to the South Koreans and to the People's Republic of China, which are very committed 'cause it is the cleanest form of energy.
NEUT36|They put money behind it and that gets companies to be involved.
NEUT37|That South Korea is good capitalism.
NEUT38|We have to do more of that, and I think that when I see that our government is is blocking off the area South Jersey, where you can in the coast where we can have windmills.
NEUT39|Uh no.
NEUT40|I mean you gotta like write a check to the companies to make windmills and say we got to get the price down here some seed money so my hope is that they do do a Tom Friedman says I think Tom Friedman's right.
NEUT41|We we all remember that NASA lowered the price of so many good materials, but right now I'm hard pressed to figure out what our government is lowered the price of.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
