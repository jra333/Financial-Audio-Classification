NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, I it's Jack we're speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this quick video on a broader com stock or ABG or as it is called in the stock market.
BULL2|So first of all, based on fundamental analysis we have to say that this company is performing in a bullish market since the middle of March.
BEAR3|So the virus came in and the market was bearish and now is in a bullish kind.
BEAR4|Bullish trend condition.
BEAR5|Currently it is actually in a sideways since last month.
NEUT6|It has been inside with strained, so in a trendless condition, but as it is shown in this technical analysis in front of us but based on technical analysis next week, I think on Thursday there will be the earnings reports showing for its fiscal second quarter of 2020 and is expected an earning for share of five point $14.00.
NEUT7|So it's it's not bad so.
BULL8|This news perhaps can push keep keep pushing up this talk, perhaps up to its previous level before the virus was approximately 330 U.S. dollar, but the target first target price based on technical analysis that it's easy to determine is just the projectile projection of this debt.
NEUT9|Recent angler depth from the breakout point of the prices, so the idea is that this pressure go up until up to this city and tenuous dollars, minimum target price and then perhaps we can keep going up with Zig Zag, Zig zagging, or Zig zag wave wave away.
NEUT10|So anyway, the point is that based on technical fundamental analysis with please just ever look watch out this this date on Thursday.
NEUT11|That is very important for the ending report.
NEUT12|The market should go.
BULL13|Up so this is my B aby condition is even this stop, let's say flat trendline has been broken as a signal of of strength of this market, because it seems that the prices are ready to resume its previous trend.
BULL14|"That's all, thanks."""
