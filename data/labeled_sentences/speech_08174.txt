NEUT0|"""Let's talk about international and you and I always talk about this."
BEAR1|You're kind of a contrarian, even within your firm.
NEUT2|In terms of thinking that investors don't necessarily need international stocks to have a globally diversified portfolio.
NEUT3|But you yesterday, at the conference you talked about Jasons wags, good piece on the perhaps relative undervaluation of foreign stocks.
NEUT4|Do you think investors ought to look at that?
BULL5|Be thinking about the fact that we have not seen foreign stocks perform as well as US.
NEUT6|I guess the answer to that is yes and no, and #1 the fact that they are undervalued may mean that they're undervalued because they're riskier, which I think is at least importantly the case.
NEUT7|Maybe not the entire case.
NEUT8|Second, I'm just a great believer in a US portfolio because we are the most entrepreneurial nation we've got.
BULL9|The soundest institutions, financial and otherwise or have had in the past.
BULL10|Governance is pretty solid.
NEUT11|In the past at least.
NEUT12|And a well diversified economy.
NEUT13|So, and for US corporations, about half of their revenues and have other earnings come from abroad anyway.
NEUT14|It's not as if we're America first or America, only the entire world economy is integrated around many, many countries, trading with many, many other countries.
NEUT15|So I do not think you need to have international now.
NEUT16|People have been doing it for a long time.
BULL17|The cash flows in the fund business have been much stronger international here in the US.
BEAR18|And despite the inferior performance, and I don't quite understand.
NEUT19|Where this thing is you that you must have a global portfolio?
NEUT20|Maybe it maybe it's right.
NEUT21|Of course, maybe anything is right, but I think the argument favors the domestic US portfolio and they have to worry about whether the dollar is strong or weak.
NEUT22|One more risk or many of these foreign nations have particular emerging market nations.
NEUT23|Which are, I think, around 20% of the non US index.
NEUT24|Are very risky, very interest, rate sensitive.
NEUT25|Governmentally not person not strong or maybe.
NEUT26|Little capable of tipping over rather easily so.
NEUT27|I knew tell people.
NEUT28|"Yeah, feel free to disagree with me 'cause I'm not always right, but if you if you have 0% in non USI say you should, you don't need to have non US but if you do limited to 20% alot of portfolios now 25 thirty 545% in non U.S. Securities and I think that's just too much."""
