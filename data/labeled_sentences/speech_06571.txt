NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Tuesday, November the 14th."
NEUT1|I'm referred by John currencyanalystericsson.com and today we're going to be looking at the Australian dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|Of the dollar is currently facing bearish bias in the short term, though the risk is somewhat to the upside.
BEAR3|We can see RSI just about pointing upwards, though it is below the 50 neutral level prices have once again found support at around 161.8% Fibo Nachi retracement level of the applet from 0.77.
NEUT4|Thirty 220 point 7897.
NEUT5|That's around the zero point 76.
BEAR6|At 30 area of the dollar dated 4 month low today of Zero Point 7608.
BULL7|But if the upside momentum gathers further strength, we could see resistance coming from just below the 200 day moving average around 0.77.
BULL8|Then we could see resist resistance coming at around the zero point 7730 area.
NEUT9|But more important is the 50% Fibonacci.
BULL10|At around Zero Point 7815, that's currently where the 50 day moving average is currently converging towards a break above the day, moving average would shift the near term bias to a bullish one, though for a more sustained rally we would need to see the pair breaking above the zero point 79 handle which is just above the previous top we saw or back in October of 0.78.
BULL11|97 however, if prices were to continue the current downtrend, we could see the next key support coming at around 261.8% Fibo Nachi as Zero Point 7465, followed by the Zero Point 72 handle as the next major support to the downside.
NEUT12|That's it for me.
BULL13|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
