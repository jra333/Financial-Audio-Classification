NEUT6|Let's get right into it.
BULL7|So over the past five years, Berkshire Hathaway is up 86.92% and over the last year it's up 20.28%.
NEUT8|This is amazing and I'm just going to be going over why I think he's able to keep this up.
NEUT9|I think that Warren Buffett is a very smart investor and he only takes the best of the best opportunities in his eyes and he buys at prices where he thinks the company is worth significantly more than it is currently trading for when he buys in.
BULL10|And this is what allows him to get such amazing returns.
BULL11|Thanks for watching.
