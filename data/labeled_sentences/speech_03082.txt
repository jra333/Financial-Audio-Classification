NEUT0|"""Hey traders and investors, it's search burger here."
NEUT1|On Monday, December the 14th.
NEUT2|As we started into this Fed week we had a bit of a shake and bake in the.
BEAR3|In the session we saw a bit of a dip in the morning and then, you know, bit of a rally into the afternoon.
NEUT4|Nothing major and I do think things you can remain in a little bit trickier as we work our way through Wednesday's FOMC meetings.
BULL5|Nonetheless, we did see a bid in the.
NEUT6|Fang stocks the fit the Facebook Amazons and Googles and some other stocks like that.
NEUT7|Let's look at a couple of just to give you a bit of reference point Amazon.com, you can see nice bullish reversal day right here at lateral support, so that's something to respect.
BULL8|Again, these are stocks that have worked all year, and now they're giving us a bullish reversal.
NEUT9|Here's Amazon.
NEUT10|We can look at.
NEUT11|We can look at Google and you can see that Google here too long tail.
BULL12|Right at the Rising 50 day moving average again bullish for a set up here and laugh at least Facebook.
NEUT13|That's really what I wanted.
NEUT14|I wanted to talk about you can see Facebook right at that 50 day moving average horizontal support that is tested once in mid November and then in late October and early November outside day bullish reversal outside day.
NEUT15|You can see the day on Monday.
NEUT16|Very much like the broader market stall.
BEAR17|Facebook push back below last Friday's lows.
BULL18|Quickly reversed higher and closed very much near that day's high.
NEUT19|So here there is a trade to be set up momentarily trade that has to go higher immediately.
NEUT20|Betrayed that one could use to play Facebook on the long side versus the intraday lows of Monday.
BEAR21|Anything below there would probably call for a bit of a bigger move down, so that's a really nice and tight area.
NEUT22|Lean against foreign trade on the long set I'm going to keep it at this nice and short.
NEUT23|Or early in the week here, so please like the video, that's how are You Tube ranks?
