NEUT0|"""Hello traders, I'm making a quick video on the dollar yen and this is the first video that will be published in this YouTube channel and also on the website so I hope it goes smoothly."
NEUT1|I've never done this before on YouTube.
NEUT2|Now the reason I'm looking at Dollar Yen is because of recent price action is looking really interesting.
NEUT3|Firstly looking at the daily chart here.
BEAR4|As you can see the 200 day moving average has been quite pivotal in determining the direction of short term trend and we have gone back below it over the last few days.
NEUT5|It's interesting that the 200 day moving average comes in around a round.
NEUT6|This level here.
NEUT7|But align right.
NEUT8|Here you can see that 108 call it 108.
NEUT9|Fifty has been support and resistance in the past and what happened earlier in the day on.
BULL10|On Tuesday is Price went above the previous day's candle.
BEAR11|And resistance at 108 fifty before coming back down to close well below it.
BEAR12|So there was a failure to hold above the previous days.
BEAR13|Hi, this is a sign that the Bulls are perhaps getting trapped.
BEAR14|So if I put another line here to indicate the previous day's low which was at 107 twelve and there's going to be lots of stops resting below that level from people who bought that later step into the 200 day moving average.
NEUT15|So I think that's where prices heading to next.
NEUT16|And so.
NEUT17|I think for as long as we hold below 108 thirty.
NEUT18|The path of least resistance would be to the downside and at the next downside target.
NEUT19|Is the liquid iti that will be resting below.
NEUT20|This weekend at 107 twelve.
BEAR21|So obviously if that level breaks and we hold below it, then the sell off could continue further and some of the other targets.
NEUT22|Could be these moving these but not retracement levels?
NEUT23|Or the round psychological handles like 105106 etc.
NEUT24|Now, at what point will I drop this bearish V?
NEUT25|Well, I think if we go back above 108 thirty.
NEUT26|Which is.
NEUT27|The 200 we average and the high of this anthology candle.
BULL28|"If we go above that level, then all bets are off for the bed and in that case we should see a nice move up and the continuation higher."""
