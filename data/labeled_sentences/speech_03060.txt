NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this will be a video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Real quick, what do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT3|In case maybe new charts instead of using these candle sticks here, representing one days where the price action, which is what you would normally see, each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT4|While this error may look like several days worth of time, it's actually the past two days broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT5|I'll let you this time frame think it's a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price, and in this situation kind of just Maps out a pattern here that has happened in the very short term.
NEUT6|So I mean, this is definitely more of a trading type perspective.
NEUT7|Oh, I should note that from a disclosure perspective, I do own Facebook in my retirement accounts.
NEUT8|From the long side, so I should have said that earlier, but I'm saying it right now.
NEUT9|So yes, I am long Facebook from the investing retirement account side of things, but happen back into the trading side of things.
NEUT10|What does this pattern that's starting to take shape?
NEUT11|Well, this is what and you know, some people would probably say.
NEUT12|Oh no, I think you're stretching the limits are a little bit, but I mean that red line is is pretty straightforward right there.
NEUT13|But this red line I could see.
BEAR14|Some people may be having problems with and this is kind of.
NEUT15|We'll call it a poor man's falling wedge and a falling wedge may sound bearish, but this is actually a bullish pattern and.
NEUT16|This is what kind of caught my eye, and if you look at the daily timeframe, so let's hop the daily real quick and you map out where all this is a kuring.
NEUT17|So you have this pattern here occurring right near the general vicinity of a key level of support.
NEUT18|You know it provides a little bit of an interesting potential tradeable opportunity now tradeable opportunity does not mean that it's for sure going to happen or anything like that, but it had the price.
BEAR19|Just continue to collapse today.
NEUT20|It would have made no sense to call anything bullish with it, but there is this.
NEUT21|Like I said, falling wedge pattern here and if it can break up through this red line right here, the upper portion of it and that's right around the hundred.
NEUT22|What is that eyeballing it?
NEUT23|Right around 177 give or take, but that will change over time.
NEUT24|'cause remember that you know a downtrending trendline, but right around 177 to 176, we'll call it.
NEUT25|You know, the price, could you know?
BULL26|Definitely get a nice little boost.
NEUT27|And am I saying it's going to the moon going back up to 200?
NEUT28|I'm not saying that.
NEUT29|Remember, we're talking about from a trade, you know a trading perspective.
NEUT30|But if the price can get, you know, in technical jargon, a pattern breakout mean it can break.
NEUT31|Above that upper orange portion, right?
NEUT32|Here, the next key overall level of resistance where the sellers are very clearly hanging out is right up there at 180.
NEUT33|Why do I say very clearly with confidence?
NEUT34|Well, I mean, the chart is showing us both there and then.
NEUT35|This morning right there the Bulls tried to get above that level and just couldn't quite do it.
NEUT36|So I mean, well, I'm not saying it's impossible to break above 180.
BULL37|Apparently according to the story that the charts telling us the Bulls really are going to bring their a game if we're going to be able to fight through 180 and then be able to maintain up above it.
NEUT38|But even if you know you know the price gets a little break right there, you know there's still a little bit of a potential for a breakout trade right there.
NEUT39|And I mean you could mitigate summon, but if it breaks through.
NEUT40|180 I'm not saying it's for sure not breaking through it and keeps on going.
BULL41|Then you could get a nice little, you know, potential breakout pattern here as next week unfolds.
NEUT42|Of course these are plays that are definitely not.
NEUT43|If you don't know how to stop losses, you probably shouldn't be trading, but if you're not good at honoring, stop losses.
NEUT44|If you don't know what I say.
NEUT45|What I mean when I say risk control, risk management, risk analysis, and these are definitely not setups for you, but from a training perspective, interesting setup here again, 30 minute time frame.
NEUT46|This whole pattern is taking place right around it and overall.
NEUT47|Bigger level of support, so who knows?
BULL48|Maybe we'll see some sort of decent sized bounce early next week.
NEUT49|One of the biggest questions that I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT50|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT51|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT52|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT53|It's completely free.
NEUT54|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT55|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
