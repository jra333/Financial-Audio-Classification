NEUT0|"""You guys, so Churchill capital?"
BEAR1|It's it's been a huge talk lately within this past week.
NEUT2|Now with Lucid Motors announcing their SPAC deal with Churchill Capital.
NEUT3|We didn't see the reaction that we wanted to and it was a simple buy.
BEAR4|The rumor sell the news so it went up to 62 and now it's back down to the 20s now 30s.
NEUT5|So what basically happened here?
NEUT6|So investors sometimes what they'll do is they'll buy the rumor and then they'll sell the news 'cause they don't want to deal with the volatility that comes after news comes out that isn't fully publicized yet.
NEUT7|For those guys you don't know, this is lucid Motors right here, promising the best chance technology to most advanced charging stations.
NEUT8|Top of the line luxurious electric vehicle out there.
BULL9|So basically they're saying they're going to be better than Tesla.
BEAR10|From a standpoint that's good from another standpoint, that's bad.
NEUT11|I it goes hand in hand.
BULL12|70 grand that's very high starting price for their first vehicle.
BEAR13|They can get this lowered to around $40,000.
NEUT14|You can see a company like Tesla, but until then I don't think it's going to be like Tesla, although it is a little curious how many middle class families can afford a Tesla compared to a $70,000 car.
NEUT15|I would say probably about 20 and 3rd 20 to 30% so not that much.
NEUT16|This guy right here.
NEUT17|This analyst says that he believes Lucid will be a $700 million company one day.
NEUT18|With the potential of reaching $700.00 just like Tesla Tesla right now is a $600 billion company.
NEUT19|Where is it?
NEUT20|How is you know the aim?
NEUT21|Do you have the fastest charging space?
NEUT22|You know there's different things out there.
NEUT23|Here it is.
NEUT24|Here's the article Lucy, the next Trillion dollar company, could see CIPS stocks or a valuation awards 700 billion, yes.
NEUT25|What this guy is saying is that right now Tesla is worth around 600,000,000.
NEUT26|CC Ivy would happen.
NEUT27|Have been at a net worth of 700 billion, and evaluation of 700 billion in order to be at the $700.00 range.
NEUT28|This guy says, you know, he believes that this company will reach that in the next four years, so there's a lot of things to look at here.
NEUT29|If you think long term within this stock, it could very well reach that $700.00 range, just like Tesla, where that $1000 range you know you never know.
NEUT30|So keep your eyes, you know on different valuations what they come out with an.
NEUT31|"I'll see you guys in the next video."""
