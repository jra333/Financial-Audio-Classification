NEUT3|Help your boy out.
NEUT4|So let's get into the video.
NEUT5|So this key support that I see going forward, it has been trading in this range, which I really don't like being in the stock when its trade in his range.
NEUT6|I do already have shares that I'm holding for a longer term, but I do want to play play this shorter term.
BEAR7|So Price has been trading sideways.
NEUT8|I want to see how price reacts when it comes to this level.
NEUT9|This level is 8.658 point 66, so I kind of want to see support.
NEUT10|If you see price come down here and start bouncing off going higher.
NEUT11|I think this right here will be a key by area.
NEUT12|But if it falls below this and hit this level we will have to wait to see what price does.
NEUT13|I wouldn't buy it, I'll wait to see if it comes with stars coming back up or if it falls below.
BULL14|This is a key support level so if it stays above here I'll be bullish.
BEAR15|If it comes below here I'll be bearish.
NEUT16|And this level is 8.25.
BEAR17|And if it falls below this area, then I don't see any support until this area, which is at 7:36.
BULL18|So that's a little good move.
BEAR19|And then if it drops this much I will have to wait to see 'cause it might trade in a range like it's been doing here.
NEUT20|It hasn't made lower lows and had hasn't made higher highs, so right now I am neutral but longer term bullish.
NEUT21|But I do want to play a shorter term so.
NEUT22|Hopefully tomorrow or Wednesday you can come down to this level.
NEUT23|Show us what it wants to do and that would giving me the entry.

BEAR29|The last defense 825 and falls below here.
