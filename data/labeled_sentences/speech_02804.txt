NEUT7|Let us move to qualitative analysis with the help of based analysis photos.
NEUT8|5 force analysis and SWOT analysis.
NEUT9|Pest analysis.
NEUT10|Best analysis deals with the following aspects, namely political aspects, economic aspects, social aspects and technological aspects.
NEUT11|Porter's five forces model boat is 5 forces model includes analysis based on competition in the industry, threat of new entrant power of suppliers by a power threat of substitute.
NEUT12|SWOT analysis SWOT analysis is divided into 2 parts internal factors and external factors.
NEUT13|Internal factors can be positive such as strength or negative factors such as weakness, external factors.
NEUT14|External factors are also positive or negative.
NEUT15|Positive factors include upper opportunities and negative factors include traits to the company.
NEUT16|One iterative analysis.
NEUT17|Quantitative analysis is done on the basis of ratio analysis.
NEUT18|So here we are calculated the following ratios for Facebook and its two competitors or rivals, namely Twitter.
NEUT19|And lived in the resource calculated here include a big dumb margin net profit margin return on assets, return on equity, asset turnover, current ratio, total dipped on equity, PE ratio, and PBS ratio.

NEUT22|Valuation.
BEAR23|So as we see the target price calculated here is 229.458 as compared to the current market price which is 174.65.
BEAR24|Hence the stock is undervalued and I recommend to buy the stocks of Facebook.
NEUT25|Accordingly, the the expected return on stock is over 31.38%.
NEUT26|Analysis based on CAPM model or CPM model.
NEUT27|So here we have calculated the risk free return of of the company market rate on current investments.
