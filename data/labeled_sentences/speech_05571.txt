BULL0|"""I'm Mark retail with Taylor Icepick, Muckermann and our stock of the day is Plug Power shares of the company are up almost 30% over the last two days."
NEUT1|Taylor, where is this small company finding such big gains?
NEUT2|Walmart distribution centers that are already in three.
NEUT3|They have about 535 hydrogen fuel cell charging stations for the forklifts and things like that.
NEUT4|So now Walmart's going to move that up to 9.
NEUT5|They're going to add six more units and 1700 different Chargers in six more distribution facility so.
BULL6|Big contract with a big company.
BULL7|Stock responded well Monday and today and they also got a couple upgrades as an effect.
NEUT8|Right now investors look at a tiny company like this and see these big wins.
BEAR9|Their 52 week low was was it 14 cents astronomically.
BULL10|So now it's up over 4000% as an investor.
NEUT11|Do you want to try to catch those runs or should you just play it smart and stay away from those tiny your companies for a while?
BEAR12|There are a lot of people have their doubts about this company and so they were still a disruptive technology or had the potential to be disruptive.
BULL13|Now you see a big player like Walmart getting in there, adding some credibility to this company so you could see some competitors.
BULL14|Maybe come in and pick up some of these units as well to try and remain competitive with the lowest cost producer in Walmart of these mega stores.
NEUT15|So maybe like a Costco or a bigger competitor like that gets involved because it is a cheaper way to operate your distribution centers.
NEUT16|Interesting, alright, so all that being said, Plug power up big today.
NEUT17|Big are you buying or you just waiting it out.
NEUT18|I'm interested to keep on now focusing on this company.
NEUT19|Before this, I really didn't know too much about them other than the fact that they.
BULL20|We're making some strides with their own technology.
BULL21|Now they're making strides with some deals, adds a little bit more color to wear.
BULL22|This company could be headed, and I do like it.
NEUT23|Maybe not after a 30% rise in just two days, but I'm going to keep my eye on this company for sure.
NEUT24|Fair enough, alright?
NEUT25|For ice pick muckerman, I'm Mark wreath, that's our stock of the day.
