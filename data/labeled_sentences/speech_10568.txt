NEUT0|"""Maybe it's take your parents to work day."
BEAR1|Today, but it seems to date The Dalles down 98.
BEAR2|SMB, declining .2%, NASDAQ edging, down .28% others strong data cut weaker by the hour, but if you're over the age of 40.
NEUT3|The only way to catch the biggest winners has been staying in touch with your children.
NEUT4|Now I'm always crediting my 4 blended family kids for ideas that I never would have picked up.
NEUT5|Pick up on at all.
NEUT6|Without them, that's right.
NEUT7|Children make you a better investor.
BULL8|Just look at snap the parent of Snapchat, which rocketed nearly 30% higher today after reporting a stunning court.
BULL9|50% revenue up much better than expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and daily average users up 19%.
NEUT10|I mean this was all that people talked about today.
NEUT11|Now that user growth is everything because of the demo graphic along time ago at thestreet.com we had a brilliant advertising guy on the board and he explained that there's a small window of time where you can create habits that last a lifetime.
NEUT12|It's when you're in your teens.
NEUT13|Mid 20s once you're past 25, you're much less likely to switch to a new shampoo or Newt news toothpaste.
NEUT14|Remember, when tobacco companies use the pictures ads in children?
NEUT15|Oh, they did it because that's when your cattle.
NEUT16|So how do advertisers reach the younger demo?
NEUT17|Well, they used to use TV.
NEUT18|But we've now got a whole generation of cord cutters who can't stand commercials these days.
NEUT19|They like to have fun online, especially by snapchatting.
NEUT20|Each other snaps even put some programming on the site and it gets views.
NEUT21|Advertisers want those eyeballs before those eyeballs get gentrified into some particular product that will never ever go back to their product.
NEUT22|So how do I know snap look?
NEUT23|I'm not exactly the target audience.
NEUT24|Well my youngest daughter is an loved, it's augmented reality photos.
NEUT25|We used to put him all over me in my head.
NEUT26|You know all this stuff I've made me look like a rabbit and I'm surprised they didn't do it this time.
NEUT27|'cause I look pretty stupid when I did it.
NEUT28|Anyway, when the company was coming public.
NEUT29|I got to sit down with CEO Evan Spiegel and what did I do?
NEUT30|I took a picture of him why I want to show how cool I was to my daughter.
NEUT31|Didn't really work.
NEUT32|Anyway.
NEUT33|The picture was new quivalent of it off the record picture so but I did notice that Snapchat, the product was irresistible to my daughter.
BEAR34|So ever since the company fixes Android App, a major and costly obstacle I've been telling us we're speculating.
