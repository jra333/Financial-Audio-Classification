NEUT0|"""This is your morning jolt, right from outside the New York Stock Exchange."
NEUT1|Here's what you need to know.
NEUT2|First off, big story, big story Coca Cola took a stake in Gatorade rival body armor.
NEUT3|I think this makes a hell of a lot of sense for Coca Cola.
NEUT4|They've never really been able to get it.
NEUT5|A lot of share on Pepsi's Gatorade, Powerade brand, so this makes sense now.
NEUT6|I've talked to Powerade founder, not Powerade founder.
NEUT7|Body Numbers founder Michael Polley.
NEUT8|Couple months ago he is 1 energetic do it.
NEUT9|I expect Coca Cola an ripoli to really push the marketing envelope here even more on body armor expand distribution really try to take it to Gatorade in 2019.
NEUT10|I think Pepsi better watch its back here and figure out some way to drop prices aggressively next year.
NEUT11|I'm sure I'll hear from them on this one.
NEUT12|Next up, Tesla CEO.
NEUT13|I mean Tesla, Tesla.
NEUT14|Also one of the big stories today, Musk teams make News B's Twitter feed and my newsletter looks at fact that.
NEUT15|Musk is it continues to embarrass the short sellers here, watching the company essentially go private in real time on Twitter hasn't necessarily been done before, maybe never been done before, but Muslims certainly going to give it a try, he said.
NEUT16|He's working with Goldman Sachs in Silver Lake on on advising him to take the company private.
NEUT17|Finally, some faces on the names incredible phases so that is interesting to see.
NEUT18|And then finally around the street.
NEUT19|You know, I talked if you have Corp CEO Steve Rendle yesterday afternoon after he decided to split the company into.
BEAR20|He said he has no idea why the stock declined on the news.
NEUT21|I don't know why this stock declined the news.
NEUT22|I think this stock VF Corp will rally and to split up the company into early 2019 it makes a lot of sense.
NEUT23|I mean the questions you should be asking right now if you're a VF Corp shareholder who comes in and buys the rest of the company, that would be North face bands and timberland.
BULL24|Very strong brands there or.
NEUT25|On the other hand, who does BF4 by my money is with lululemon, or underarm.
NEUT26|I think the company is loading up for a major acquisition in 2019 or 2020.
NEUT27|Remember her first and last.
NEUT28|He kind of playing off Tesla news.
NEUT29|Katherine Ross spoke to Workhorse CEO yesterday, Steven Burns.
NEUT30|They just came out with a new electric pickup truck.
NEUT31|Check that story out in the street.
NEUT32|Very fascinating stuff.
NEUT33|They have their new electric pickup truck to market before Tesla.
NEUT34|Go figure I'm out hanging there.
BEAR35|Turkey currency crisis.
NEUT36|"Pull down a little bit, get out there and make some trades."""
