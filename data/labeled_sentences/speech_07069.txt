NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today."
NEUT1|I'm going to be taking a look at the cryptocurrency data so TH ETA against ever US based on finance, prices and just do some technical analysis.
NEUT2|An update from my last video so these support and resistance levels that I had drawn out or from that last video that I made.
NEUT3|You know there's this support level kind of rising a little bit, but for the most part right around that like 11 to like $11.20 range and then you have this strong resistance on the daily around that 325 level.
NEUT4|So at this point this one is still kind of consolidating inside of this channel.
NEUT5|We have this huge run up a little bit over a week, week and a half some sideways consolidation high and tight and you know unfortunately this one with 53 minutes left.
NEUT6|I don't know how the daily candle is going to end up closing.
BULL7|There was extremely strong volume today.
NEUT8|So would I be watching for on this one is for the next daily candle to continue to push higher and try to crack this like 325 three thirty level again you can see that this upper wake right around like 367 three to like or 1367 to like 1370 was hit.
NEUT9|But ultimately you know it couldn't kind of.
BULL10|I keep above that level and really started to pull back in today, So what I'd be watching for is for a decently strong close potentially above this level right here around that $12.30.
NEUT11|So if we zoom in here.
NEUT12|You kind of see what I'm talking about just right at this spot right here.
BULL13|This would kind of be the level I'd want to see it broken and held on the daily, and then I want to see it again start to push up towards highs and ultimately break out if it starts to break out and close above this like 1340 level or it looks like it's going to.
NEUT14|You know, I could see this one potentially retesting those highs around that like 1420, fourteen, 30.
NEUT15|Or really like 1470 spot break.
NEUT16|That and this one should, I think, run.
NEUT17|You know anywhere from 16 to $17.00 pretty quickly after that.
NEUT18|But again, if this level can't get broken, you know the next spot to watch as far as support goes is right around 11 to $11.20.
BEAR19|If those levels start to get lost, this one is likely going to the low $10 range in the shorter term, especially with how weak Bitcoin and a lot of other crypto currencies have been.
NEUT20|So that's kind of what I'd be watching for it to the downside, but again.
BULL21|This one is still set up pretty nicely.
BULL22|Just needs to have a strong, close and continue to get even more volume into the next couple of days and this one is still set up just pretty nicely overall.
NEUT23|So those are just some of the levels I'd be watching to both.
NEUT24|The upside and downside, so if this video is valuable to you at all, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share.
NEUT25|As always, amount of financial advisor.
NEUT26|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT27|If you're going to do any investing, speak to a certified financial advisor and just write.
BULL28|Like all those support and resistance levels that I've been talking about are to help.
NEUT29|Potentially guide individuals to come up with their own trading plan to make the best decisions possible for their own strategy.
NEUT30|Whether it's you know just sitting on the sidelines, figuring out where they can dip by figuring out what would make this chart look strong, just kind of things like that.
NEUT31|So it's more of just kind of an educational vibe.
BULL32|"So as always, just thank you for watching everyone."""
