BEAR1|This is a short trader took in Ko Coca Cola and this stock was actually in a nice downtrend.
BEAR2|Earnings came along and the stock gapped down the next day on heavy volume.
BEAR3|Not at all rare as people in the long side who know what they're doing will exit that trade happy with a small loss knowing that the stock could even go lower.
NEUT4|They don't want to sit through where I sat through in Ivan.
NEUT5|Check out that trade if you want a quick little lesson.
NEUT6|So I actually shorted this stock.
NEUT7|In today I saw that it wasn't filling the gap doesn't mean that it couldn't fill the gap over the next few days.
BULL8|Right, it get filled their pronounce protective stop in that trade an I rode this stock down very nicely all the way over.
NEUT9|To this day right here.
NEUT10|So I sold half of my position there.
NEUT11|Let the stock run for just a little bit further.
NEUT12|And on this day I exited the other half of that trade.
NEUT13|Alright, so nothing to write home about.
BULL14|It's almost flat, but I did get did give it a good chance anyway.
NEUT15|One thing I could have done better in this trade is to give the other half of my trade a little bit more room to run.
BEAR16|This stock had ended up putting in a very nice downtrend and ended up very very low as it was the stock just shop around for awhile after that kind of went up and down and sideways and everywhere.
NEUT17|But that's all hindsight so I always want to try to leave at least some of my money on the table.
NEUT18|Get stopped out of the other half.
BULL19|If I'm feeling good about the position, I'll keep a nice wide stop.
NEUT20|Happy to play with the houses money and that's why I would try to strive for in the future.
NEUT21|That of course goes in a Journal so that you can learn from those ideas and become a better trader going forward.
