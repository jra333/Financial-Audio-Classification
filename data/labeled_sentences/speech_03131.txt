NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about fuel cell.
NEUT2|This is a stock that a viewer asked me to go over.
NEUT3|If there are different companies that you guys want me to look over, let me know.
NEUT4|Comment them down below.
NEUT5|If enough people want to see or enough people are interested, I would love to make a video for you guys and if not usually I try to respond within the same day to the comments giving you guys a brief description of you know where.
BULL6|I think there's some good major support and resistance is.
NEUT7|Of course, I'm not going to do that with every single comment, but overall stay connected comment.
NEUT8|Let us know what you like, what you don't like, what type of socks you want to look at.
BULL9|It's a great way for me to cater this channel more towards you guys.
NEUT10|The community who have made us who we are and got us up to 15,000 Subs.
BULL11|Thank you guys so much.
NEUT12|Let's talk about fuel cell.
BULL13|So overall fuel cells had a massive year.
BEAR14|A rough couple of months and a lot of people might say themselves like oh the stocks down 59% but you have to realize is just.
BULL15|In the past six months alone, the stock is still up 503%, so number one off the bat.
BEAR16|Just because the stocks down 50% in the past couple of months does not mean it needs to bounce.
BULL17|So understand that still up 500% year, which is absolute insanity.
NEUT18|Now if we look at fuel cell, one of the first things to notice is we have just been bouncing between the 61.8 FIB annachi support and bouncing between this 50% Fibonacci projections or resistance.
NEUT19|So about $15.50 is.
BEAR20|Resistance $12.00 as a support we have started to squeeze here on this TTM and it looks like as of right now fuel cell will be moving back down to that $12.00 support.
NEUT21|Now something that I don't like that fuel cell is doing is making a very strong descending triangle pattern so if I just remove remove the fibbonaci in general and draw this out you will see that.
BEAR22|Technically, this is not a good sign right here.
NEUT23|Normally when you have a fixed support that is holding steady here at $12.00, as well as a descending resistance, those movies way down to $12.00 where it normally ends up happening in this predicament as we start to squeeze, start to squeeze, and then the fall floors of the fall.
NEUT24|The floor.
BEAR25|Sorry guys, floor falls out and we make this big move down to the 200 day SMAP, which is $9 so for me.
NEUT26|I would not be touching fuel cell right now at this exact moment.
BULL27|What I would need to see is a ton of flow come in and for this thing to kick back up over $14.50 and start to make its way back up.
NEUT28|Doesn't seem like that's happening, however.
NEUT29|If you're somebody who does believe in fuel cell, remember, I'm not always right, I'm just giving you what I see as an opinion.
NEUT30|I'm not a financial advisor, but if you guys do believe in fuel cell and you're a traitor, you know from a long term perspective this doesn't mean anything.
NEUT31|But from a trading stand.
NEUT32|Point if we break this $12.00 support and not just break it like you know we've broken before here and then quickly get back up broken before here get back up but if we close multiple days below $12.00, do not be surprised if it very quickly fills this.
BEAR33|Move down to 9 bucks because when you have this thin volume on a volume profile and not nothing but like a major support down here at $9, this thing could dump 30% in a matter of about two weeks.
NEUT34|And we've seen that happen before.
NEUT35|Overall, 2 from a flow standpoint, nothing really at all today except for one major put that came in but.
NEUT36|It's still not that crazy.
NEUT37|I for me I would want to see a ton of boats coming in, or at least a ton of calls.
NEUT38|So for me the flow is sort of irrelevant today so you guys be careful with this.
NEUT39|Not something I would be touching right now and less.
NEUT40|I was selling heavy heavy out of the money puts that you guys for all the support hit the like button.
