BULL0|"""Good morning, and today we're talking about highly on in these videos."
NEUT1|I like to just go over the overall price action of the stock.
NEUT2|Do you like these kind of videos please?
NEUT3|Like and subscribe, and let's look at the chart so.
BULL4|Couple days ago I said, hey, if we ever break above, this will probably find some form resistance at this line.
NEUT5|You know we did.
NEUT6|We broke up.
BULL7|We found resistance.
BEAR8|We had a pullback.
BEAR9|And then at that point we gapped up above it yesterday.
NEUT10|And now we continue.
NEUT11|Had to run up all the way up until like $24.00.
BEAR12|Jackson was in a bad spot.
BEAR13|That's where we gapped down originally here.
NEUT14|But if I was looking at trying to, you know, maybe jump into this stock.
BULL15|'cause if I person you know if you think it was going to continue going up, I could see maybe around meal around 2225 ish is like a support or potential balance.
NEUT16|Maybe a little bit lower than that but.
NEUT17|You don't get too picky, and then I see are you know overall resistance area around 20 or around $26 to 2630 ish.
NEUT18|In general, if the stock see, I mean, even historically, if you look at the stock, it came down here.
NEUT19|Trade on here just for a little bit, and then ran back up and it ran quiet up quite quickly.
NEUT20|If you think about it.
NEUT21|Shout.
NEUT22|Something bad would have to come out, be personally for me to see.
NEUT23|This falling all the way back down to here or even lower.
BULL24|I think long term it is honestly a solid play.
BULL25|It's a good company.
NEUT26|He had an article just recently talking about how he feels that you know his company is not just good in the United States, but he thinks there's a good market for it everywhere.
NEUT27|But in general.
BULL28|Yeah, I mean, I think ultimately the stock will go up.
BEAR29|I think it may take some form of a break between 30 and 27 and it could potentially consolidate here.
NEUT30|I mean this which was support at one point would be resistant.
NEUT31|So a short term price target would be around 30 bucks for the stock.
NEUT32|But yeah, that's about it.
NEUT33|Yeah, that's all I got in terms of the charge.
NEUT34|So where we're at and what I'm no price targets for today and going forward.
NEUT35|Have a good day.
BULL36|"Thank you for watching."""
