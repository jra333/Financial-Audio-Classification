NEUT0|"""Hey guys it's Tony."
NEUT1|I wanted to come on here.
NEUT2|I mean I sold a lot of my my put my foot positions today so I banked like a car like a pretty decent amount of money.
NEUT3|Today I'll go on that later but.
NEUT4|To be honest, I'm only coming on here 'cause I did a lot of tea yesterday and it's a little worrisome and like to be completely honest like I'm a little worried about what's going on because I looked at a lot of these positions and you know a lot of these are, you know.
NEUT5|Like for example, PLT are right where we're sitting at like 2122 bucks the next we do drop the next, the next stop, the next time we drop.
NEUT6|We're definitely we can definitely see you know eighteen 1950s on PTR, and I've seen that in all of these in a bunch of stocks.
NEUT7|Man like.
NEUT8|You know, Disney, for example, is at 200 and the next support is at 1:50 or.
NEUT9|Right is that 40 bucks the next support is like 25 bucks.
NEUT10|So a lot of these stocks.
BEAR11|That's the bad part.
BEAR12|You know, 'cause we keep dropping like this.
NEUT13|I think the next try.
BEAR14|Think if we don't stop dropping, I think the next drop is going to be very very big, which is very scary to think about.
NEUT15|Because like I said, a lot of these stocks man like the next report, the next support zone is a lot lower than you think, so it's one of those things where it's like you know if.
BEAR16|For example like Tesla, Tesla drops from, Tesla drops from 560 these lows.
NEUT17|The next stop from that is 450 bucks.
NEUT18|There's no in between, right?
NEUT19|The next stop is 450, which is a scary part and an it's one of those things where it's kind of scary to look at when you see it completely throughout the whole range of stocks, right?
BEAR20|Like you see, everything and everything has a huge gap from a certain price to a certain price, but that also means that from that top price at high price it can drop heavily, heavily, heavily down to that previous support, which is scary and I'm just letting you guys know I'm not scared.
NEUT21|I'm not selling positions, it's just one of those things I'm just kind of all, man, this is.
BEAR22|This is not looking like the best time right now, right?
NEUT23|'cause if we do have another big drop and we despair rally doesn't this this parish rally doesn't or there's drop doesn't end.
BULL24|"Oh man, I can see a lot of bad things happening soon."""
