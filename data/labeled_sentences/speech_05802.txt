NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|This is Abby finance here today we're just going to talk from the top of our head.
NEUT2|Really no particular topic in mind.
NEUT3|We're just going to discuss our portfolio a little bit.
NEUT4|So I think one of the most interesting Holdings in My Portfolio right now would have to be the Coca Cola Company.
NEUT5|You can see.
NEUT6|Looking down here, the market cap of this company is about $179 billion, so Coca Cola is a relatively large company and their price to earnings ratio is 27.84.
NEUT7|They're giving out a dividend yield of 3.35%.
NEUT8|Basically, this company is a dividend aristocrat.
NEUT9|They have been paying out dividends for the past 100 years and each year they've actually increased their dividend and as a matter of fact, they've never decreased their dividend, while some years they may maintain the dividend at the same amount, they've never actually decreased the amount of dividends that they're paying out per share.
NEUT10|So what that means is if you were to buy Coca Cola today and they're paying out $0.37 per share as a dividend in.
NEUT11|100 years from now they would still be paying out at minimum $0.37 per share in in terms of dividend income.
NEUT12|What's more interesting though is that Coca Cola has the power to price their goods, their drinks, their water, their soda.
NEUT13|Powerade everything that Coca Cola owns in their business portfolio.
BULL14|They have the ability to actually increase the price each year due to inflation, so you as a shareholder of Coca Cola, actually benefit from this while the price goes up.
BULL15|Your income from the Coca Cola company is actually going to be increasing as well because Coca Cola increases the dividends that they pay back to their shareholders as a result of them increasing their earnings over the years.
NEUT16|So I hope you guys like this format.
NEUT17|This is basically just off the top of my head, me talking about one of the companies I own in My Portfolio, giving you a few reasons why I own Coca Cola.
NEUT18|Great, so this is Abby Finance sending off.
