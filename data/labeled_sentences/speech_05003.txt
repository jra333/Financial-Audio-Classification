BULL0|"""Hey good afternoon everyone."
BULL1|Happy Monday to you all were back from a nice long weekend.
NEUT2|Hope everybody had a wonderful Easter and will go ahead and get started here with our chart of the week and this week we're taking a look at old favorite Netflix.
NEUT3|Then it looks like it's ready to make a move to some higher ground, so will mark this chart up as we go along.
BEAR4|What's interesting here about Netflix is of course the stock got absolutely just drilled from the beginning of the year and we can see how far the stock fell.
BEAR5|Down near 2020 four 25%.
NEUT6|It closed at the end of December at about 115.
BEAR7|It hit a low of about 7980 bucks.
NEUT8|Around February 8th, 9th of this year, so really spectacular fall.
BULL9|But since then it's worked its way up and we can see here that it has made a move back up to near the 100 area.
BEAR10|It's really sort of Kong consolidating.
NEUT11|Around this.
NEUT12|97 call it to about 90.
NEUT13|$97.00 to about 101 range right.
NEUT14|But what's interesting is that in this month of March we've had in.
BULL15|During this consolidation, we've had some decent volume.
BULL16|But we've seen the volume sort of taper off here, but then more recently, you see that that volume start to rise, and that's what we'd like to see.
NEUT17|After a consolidation, we see the interest start coming back into the stock.
BEAR18|We've had some pullbacks here on the stock and we can see that the relative strength index is held that 15 level, which was a key area to hold back in the early part of March.
NEUT19|We held it just last week.
BULL20|We made a higher high on the chart as well an I think that this shock, certainly with the as a momentum in here.
NEUT21|And let's, let's face it, Netflix is one of those high beta high juice names that.
BULL22|Lots of traders like to get onto an we can see just just a couple of days ago through Wednesday and Thursday the stock pulled in gave a little bit of an opportunity to get on board but shot right back up.
BULL23|Today it was strong all day long today on Monday and it was quite notable.
NEUT24|So where do we think this stock is going to be headed to?
BEAR25|Of course it's got lots of resistance ahead here we see some resistance coming in at about the 200 moving average, which comes in just under 160 bucks, 100 and 595.
NEUT26|What we like here is the fact that moving averages have started to turn higher, and we're trading in the higher end of the range as well to the more recent range.
NEUT27|So that's the positive.
BEAR28|Look if the market does correct, it's going to take Netflix down with it.
BULL29|No question about it, but as long as the markets stay afloat here and the action remains constructive, I think that Netflix is going to get some interest and we should see this stock start moving higher.
NEUT30|Again they have earnings coming out in about 3 1/2 four weeks.
NEUT31|That's always the adventure as well too.
BULL32|For now, I think Netflix it's got some higher prices ahead, maybe 510%, perhaps in the not too distant future.
BULL33|Thanks very much for watching everyone.
NEUT34|"And I'll see you guys next time."""
