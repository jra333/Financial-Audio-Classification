NEUT0|"""What do you think the ECB do here?"
NEUT1|Because their hands are really tight, they just had to justify ending quantitative easing to the markets yesterday.
NEUT2|We found it in the minutes that they're considering another round of bank liquidity operations in the form of Tel TRO.
NEUT3|I mean, what can they do here to actually stimulate the economy given the economy is nose diving?
BULL4|Well look, they have the firepower and we've heard from a number of ECB members in last week about the possibility of the tielt rose, the bank lending being extended later in 2019, but it's far from unanimous across the ECB we've heard from Novotney.
BEAR5|We've heard from the signals from other parts of the ECB governing Council that they are less willing to tolerate that.
NEUT6|But from my perspective, it's not clear to me that the slowdown in Europe at the moment.
NEUT7|Is as a result of credit deficiency.
NEUT8|I think there are much more to loot your previous question, political concerns, not just US China, but the slowdown in Italy, but also a set of unfortunate circumstances that have all coalesced at the same time.
NEUT9|The auto crisis in Germany to four, and I think policy members, particularly CB, will want to wait in their communications before for more data before committing to a forward path, right?
NEUT10|But Simon again to pick up on that.
NEUT11|The ECB say this over and over again.
NEUT12|They have got one needle in their compass.
NEUT13|There's supposed to be targeting inflation.
NEUT14|If you look at metrics like 5 year, five year inflation, which is what the market expects in five years time in 10 years time for inflation to look like that metric is running at multi year lows right around 1.4% of far cry from that 2% target.
BEAR15|So the market is indeed putting pressure on them to do something.
NEUT16|Do you think the ECB may very well find themselves in a situation where they have no choice but to restart quantitative easing again?
NEUT17|Well, it's one or it's a question for the CP on how much they value their credibility.
NEUT18|But you're right insofar as if you take the five year five year, which is Mario Draghi the ECB president preferred metric for inflation expectations.
BEAR19|It's stuck below 2%.
BEAR20|But let's be honest, it was also stuck quite comfortably below 2% throughout 2017, eighteen when growth was much healthier.
NEUT21|There is a structural problem of low deflation.
NEUT22|You look at the core inflation metric.
NEUT23|It's averaged about one to one point 1% over the last five to six years.
NEUT24|You know there is a question looming for the ECB's weather.
NEUT25|Given the amount of monetary firepower that will be required to get inflation sustainably back to 2%, whether actually they're prepared to deal with the capital allocation problems, the financial stability risks the communication problems that would go with sticking to that and therefore a decision is looming with or without all the other noise going on in the wider macro economy.
