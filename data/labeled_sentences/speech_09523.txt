NEUT0|"""He was going on YouTube, Kenny here, so my Internet is back 48 hours without Internet so that's why you didn't see a video."
NEUT1|But we're taking our first trade with the charity account if you don't want to share the account is it's our attempt to take $600 a small account like the stimulus check if you will, and we're trying to make it into $6000 by the end of the year.
NEUT2|And if I don't make it then I just pay out of pocket to the charity of our choice anyways.
NEUT3|So we're taking our very first trade.
NEUT4|So right now we are using Weibull.
NEUT5|If you want to contribute used weibling can all the proceeds will go to the trading account and the charity.
NEUT6|Anyways, so here's here's what we're doing.
NEUT7|We are going to take a trading course here.
BULL8|What we're looking at is we're looking at for a bounce off 33, but it looks like it got ahead of itself.
BULL9|It still may come down in pounds, but it's cleared the 50 day and hundred day moving average pretty convincingly for.
NEUT10|Therefore, once it cleared the 100, you know you really can serve.
NEUT11|You could wait towards the end of the day to see where we land, and if we hold if we hold, definitely get in, but for me I went ahead and already took a position here.
NEUT12|So what we're looking at is from here, you know, taking an getting a position and holding it to about 44, which would give us about 20%.
NEUT13|You say why 4044?
BULL14|Well, we got to 44 last time right here and got rejected, so we're going to go ahead and hold to 44 and get about a 20% gain.
NEUT15|Hopefully it may run to 51, but really, we're just trying to get this account start to get some momentum.
NEUT16|A little bit of a tech sell off, so we're going to go ahead and.
BULL17|Against that the move with the VIX today would put us an on risk off setting for little bit early, so that should improve the tech forecast for for a little bit at least.
NEUT18|That said, you know taking a non leveraged.
NEUT19|Non leveraged position, just the $600 flat out and what we will do is because we will has two according to the quote 2X leverage on Corsair for overnight trade.
NEUT20|So what we will do is we'll make sure we save our day trades just in case.
BEAR21|But if it does hit 33 will take the other $600 of leverage or probably $500 at that point once we get down here and add to our position, that will be our final but if it does drop if it doesn't drop.
NEUT22|And will think about adding to our position once we clear about 39 or whatever the 200 day is at the time.
NEUT23|So like right now it's at about 39, so that's how we're playing that just quick video.
NEUT24|Just wanted to get that out there because folks were interested in and watching me go through this trading account so I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT25|This is just for entertainment.
NEUT26|Don't trade what I trade, just figure it out yourself, but this is what I'm doing.
NEUT27|This is how I'm doing it and I'm going to take my time with this one.
NEUT28|Warm this account up, try to get to 1000 first before we make any really.
NEUT29|A really aggressive play so.
NEUT30|That's it for now, but I will be making another video today for sure, so I'll see you again in a few hours.
BULL31|"But yeah, thanks for watching."""
