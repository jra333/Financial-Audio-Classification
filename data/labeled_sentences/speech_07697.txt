NEUT0|"""Hi guys this is Dan from the investment ABC and I just wanted to give a short update on what Warren Buffett is believing with."
NEUT1|The stock market is heading according to Berkshire Hathaway's first quarter earnings, Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, sold 6 billion U.S. dollar worth of stocks and April alone.
NEUT2|Normally Warren Buffett is always super bullish on the US economy.
NEUT3|No matter when you ask him.
NEUT4|But it seems very unlike Buffett to sell stocks in a crash in 2008 during the financial crisis, Buffett used his huge cash position to buy steaks and Goldman Sachs Bank of America or Dow Chemicals.
BULL5|Currently, Buffett has been sitting on a huge cash position of 128 billion U.S. dollar which he now increased even further.
NEUT6|Many people thought that Buffett Wood by hand over fist during the huge crash we have seen in March when the Dow went to almost 18,000 but they were totally wrong.
NEUT7|Like I said in one of my videos way sold some of his Ellen positions in Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
NEUT8|Buffett knows that the economy won't recover in a V shape fashion and that the bailout deals might not be in favor of.
BEAR9|Existing shareholders many were criticizing me and saying that he wanted to be under the 10% rule, so he doesn't have to report his transactions quickly.
NEUT10|They were saying that Buffett most likely is buying now Ellen Stocks quietly, but it seems they were totally wrong.
BEAR11|In fact, the actions Buffett is taking and the statements of Charlie Manga in a recent interview shows us that they think the US stock market will most likely retest the lows and maybe go even lower from there.
NEUT12|Charlie Munger said, quote.
NEUT13|I would say basically we like the captain of the ship when the worst typhoon that's ever happened comes.
BULL14|We just want to get through the typhoon and we'd rather come out of it with a whole lot of liquidity.
NEUT15|We're not playing.
NEUT16|Oh, goodie goodie.
BEAR17|Everything's going to hell.
NEUT18|Let's plunge 100% of the reserves into buying businesses.
NEUT19|Quote end.
NEUT20|Both of these experienced investors seem to feel that something big is about to come.
NEUT21|Buffett's favorite indicator that total market cap of publicly traded stocks.
BEAR22|Divided by the US GDP is sitting at currently 132.3% almost as high as duringthe.com bubble and way higher than before the financial crisis with around 102% Berkshire Hathaway posted its biggest quarterly everlost of 50 billion U.S. dollar due to roughly 55 billion in investment losses.
BULL23|Analysts were expecting a 6.33 billion U.S. dollar profit in that quarter.
BEAR24|It seems like not even Warren Buffett will be saved from what is coming to hit the stock market soon.
BEAR25|Especially when I see his overexposure to the banking industry and Apple.
BULL26|But with this huge cash position of around 137 billion U.S. dollar, he will be able to really find some good bargains soon.
NEUT27|If you are one of my older subscribers, you know that I'm seeing the stock market to retest the lows.
NEUT28|At least one more time in the next three to six months or even earlier before we have a decision.
NEUT29|If we see a double bottom or go lower from there, many people believe the Fed will never let the stock market fall.
NEUT30|But this is exactly the time when the markets begin to roll over again.
NEUT31|"So stay cautious guys if you like this video and think also a second major crash is on its way, hit the like button, share, subscribe and comment by and see you in the next one."""
