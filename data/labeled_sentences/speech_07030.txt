NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol Disp Disney."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Quite the eventful day today, and I don't mean the state the obvious, but it will anyways just to establish some context.
BULL3|But overall a good solid move after earnings.
NEUT4|I mean, especially when you think about it that just on Thursday the price was all the way down there.
BULL5|But now the prices battled back up to where it is now.
NEUT6|Yes, there's still more work that needs to be done.
NEUT7|But the point here being relatively speaking from where the price was to where it is nice solid move.
NEUT8|But that does bring about the valid question.
NEUT9|I'll but is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT10|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT12|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT13|And in my mind, intervals on a single area and that area is right here at one 3650.
NEUT14|Now why is 136 fifty important?
NEUT15|Not saying that all this was going to happen, but just for explanation, saying if the price were to come down to that area, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT16|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT17|That would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of the range of the chart that it just broke out from.
NEUT18|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly a sign of true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT19|But to be fair, no price and go straight up.
NEUT20|So maybe the price comes down here behaved in that manner.
NEUT21|Then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT22|Now all of a sudden, what would you have while you have a set of those right there?
NEUT23|You'd have those loads down there if you envision each one of those is Terra steps, well, hey, now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
NEUT26|And in this situation again, that quote unquote sign of progress being at one 3650 now as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|If this movement is going to continue upwards first, the level of resistance in the near term going to be right up here at the 139 mark.
BEAR28|That level was very stubborn this afternoon.
NEUT29|And then if the price can push up through 139 next key level after that sits right up there around the 141.
BULL30|25 mark so keep an eye on those couple areas moving forward, but All in all, nice movement today.
NEUT31|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum from earnings next week, we'll see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT41|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
