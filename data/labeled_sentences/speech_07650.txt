NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's a different guy coming at you with another Warren Buffett portfolio update."
NEUT1|We're going over the moves from Q2 to Q3 that were reported in the F-12 filing.
NEUT2|We've gone over every move so far.
NEUT3|This one is back to Big Pharma.
NEUT4|We already went over Pfizer but he actually bought a handful of pharmaceutical stocks and this one Bristol Myers Squibb is a new addition to the portfolio.
NEUT5|He bought 29.9 million shares at a value of $1.81 billion so this was one of the bigger.
NEUT6|Guys I want to comes to Big Pharma.
BEAR7|Fire was actually a smaller position which is kind of surprising considering that they're the ones that are known as the frontrunners right now for the vaccine.
NEUT8|But Warren Buffett's third quarter bet on Big Pharma included buying almost thirty million shares of Bristol Myers Squibb.
NEUT9|Worth about $1.81 billion.
BULL10|Bmy beefed up in a big way a year ago when it acquired pharmaceutical giant Selligent and has now that has to be a big part of the attraction of this stock.
BULL11|That deal brought a pair of blockbuster multiple Melanoma treatments.
NEUT12|I'm running to try those at the latter of which treats man, T cell lymphoma and my to list my deal plastic syndromes.
NEUT13|That's part that that's kind of par for Bristol Myers course.
BULL14|A long track record of successful acquisitions have kept the farmers pipeline.
NEUT15|Primed with big name drugs over the years, among the better known names today are called him in and blood thinner and like a page or type for type 2 diabetes.
NEUT16|Sorry for butchering, knows the names but this is one of his big bets and big Pharma and this is what he did about a $1.8 billion investment into two other big pharma companies.
NEUT17|So I was surprised to see how much bigger of an investment he did for the other pharmaceutical companies versus Pfizer given.
NEUT18|Visors the front runner in the Maxine and I do understand that you can't put your money in Pfizer simply because of the front runner, but I'm surprised to see that he didn't do.
NEUT19|And even allocation through for every big pharma.
NEUT20|Company and guys, this isn't really a surprise or it shouldn't be too.
NEUT21|People who are fans of Buffett or people who are Berkshire shareholders because he excuse me.
NEUT22|He in past years has talked about how he wanted to get into Big Pharma anyway.
NEUT23|But he did say that if he was going to get into Big Pharma, he wouldn't pick just one.
NEUT24|He wants to get an array of them, which is exactly what he did.
NEUT25|We've currently got Pfizer.
NEUT26|Now he's got Bristol Myers Squibb and there are a couple more that he, he added.
NEUT27|I believe about the same $1.81 billion allocation to you guys.
NEUT28|Let me know what you're favorite pharma stock is.
NEUT29|Mine is actually Abby, but I do really like Pfizer as well and I've looked into Bristol Myers Squibb and Mark.
NEUT30|So with that being said, guys, let me know what you're favorite pharma stock is down in the comments below.
NEUT31|Are you guys a fan of him selling out of banks and getting into Big Pharma?
NEUT32|Do you think that's the right move right now?
BEAR33|Do you think it was a bad move?
NEUT34|Let me know.
NEUT35|Down in the comments as well, I do like to get a lot of feedback and he's one of the smartest investors, if not the smartest investor in the world.
NEUT36|So when he makes moves, it's really cool to cover them and kind of get you know back and forth with other people to see how they feel and maybe what they would have done and kind of get insights on what people think he's doing with this money.
BULL37|But anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching.
NEUT38|Remember, we're going to have a couple more videos on the Oracle of Omaha and what he did for this quarter because I think it's really cool to keep people updated on kind of cover it because.
