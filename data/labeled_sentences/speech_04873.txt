NEUT0|"""September the 21st is in the books here on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
BEAR2|It's been a day dominated by two central banks, neither of which got the reaction.
NEUT3|I suspect they were expecting first.
BEAR4|This is how the yen responded to the Bank of Japan's announcement that it was going to be targeting the remarkably low level of a zero percent 10 year bond yield.
NEUT5|You would think that was dovish, but they didn't cut rates which are already negative.
BULL6|And as you can see, it actually strengthened the yen.
NEUT7|Now here we had from the feds.
NEUT8|This is how the bonds market responded to the announcement.
NEUT9|They weren't raising rates, but.
BEAR10|3 governors had voted to do so, a very high level of dissent.
NEUT11|Plainly a hawkish hold.
BULL12|You would have thought the bond market, however treated as those dovish you can see that the stock market really liked the afternoon announcements, and in particular, emerging markets rallied very strongly.
NEUT13|They always like it when the Fed appears to be lenient.
NEUT14|Now, according to the feds official dot projection, they're going to be raising rates once this year and twice next.
NEUT15|This is the probability according to the Fed Funds futures market that they actually.
NEUT16|"Do that, the market is still fighting the Fed and that's the New York Minute."""
