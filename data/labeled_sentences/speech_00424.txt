NEUT0|"""All of YouTube, what up?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another wealth preservation video.
NEUT2|In this one.
BULL3|The Silver Bean counter is taking stacking to a new level with a little help from Bloomberg.
NEUT4|We're taking gold stacking mainstream.
NEUT5|That's right, the Silver Bean counter is going to be is actually on the Bloomberg.
NEUT6|Call me a contributor the show good money that episode Gold?
NEUT7|Let's do it.
NEUT8|Yes, it's true.
BULL9|I had the honor the pleasure of participating in this fun little project.
NEUT10|I was contacted by the producer of Good Money, a show on Bloomberg Quicktake.
NEUT11|Here, the producer Henry Baker the show, the episode everything you need to know about gold.
NEUT12|So I'll provide a link to the Bloomberg page so you can see for yourself.
BULL13|Pretty cool show.
NEUT14|Glad to be a part of it, but hey, here's a couple of quick shots of the video itself.
NEUT15|Take a look at YouTube and you'll see no shortage of collectors or as they call themselves stackers who keep their precious metals on site.
NEUT16|Why do they do it?
NEUT17|I talked with the owner of the account Silver Bean counter to find out he wasn't willing to show his face, but you'd probably value your privacy too.
NEUT18|If you had 10s of thousands of dollars of gold coins in your house, this is a 1924.
NEUT19|American Gold Eagle right here.
NEUT20|This is a South African krugerrand Australian kangaroo.
NEUT21|Yes, you know the big reasons people purchase precious metals in the 1st place is it's it's really untraceable.
NEUT22|Very common.
NEUT23|Governments.
NEUT24|Businesses don't know that you have it, so it's a good way to store wealth in a very private way.
NEUT25|I keep it all in a spreadsheet so I have a running total.
NEUT26|I know exactly what I spent on something when I bought it with the spot price of the precious metal was at the time whether or not it's gold or silver.
NEUT27|Then of course, the current value of it.
NEUT28|I track that as well.
NEUT29|Stacking is basically purchasing of precious metals on a regular basis.
NEUT30|It whether or not you do it weekly with each paycheck or monthly, you've got a budget that you **** that you set for yourself and you just buy the old stacker.
NEUT31|The old stacker mentality is pretty cool.
NEUT32|Ladies and gentlemen, check it out.
BULL33|Hey, appreciate you guys watching appreciate you guys watching this show as well.
NEUT34|Take it easy guys.
NEUT35|"Shut up."""
