NEUT0|"""Apple's been on a roll lately since the stock split was announced, what can we expect going forward?"
NEUT1|Let's take a look.
NEUT2|Here's Apple's graph for the last couple weeks.
NEUT3|As you can see, the massive runup due to the stock split being announced, which is right around here.
NEUT4|2 today.
NEUT5|So let's take a look and have the lines of support and resistance that we're going to encounter.
NEUT6|So the biggest one that is probably most relevant to us here, which some of the most recent.
NEUT7|It's got 437.
NEUT8|As you can see it says support.
NEUT9|Here, whoops.
NEUT10|So we're going to have green being in lines of support and Reds being lined the resistance.
NEUT11|Obviously, that that I hear 457.
NEUT12|Is resistance.
NEUT13|Here also you can see it got rejected here a couple of times.
NEUT14|About 453.
BEAR15|We're bouncing off right at that level, so this is going to be a very critical point here.
NEUT16|Also potentially.
NEUT17|Here is this line of support.
BEAR18|As you can see, it's been bouncing off.
NEUT19|1/2 then this is kind of a couple times here.
NEUT20|So here is the line of support.
NEUT21|So we can expect.
NEUT22|Some movement in this channel here.
BEAR23|We saw a massive run up today.
NEUT24|It's kind of a sector rotation.
NEUT25|Much of the last couple of days.
BEAR26|It's kind of been kinda down due to some announcements and this I mean tech has been down at the beginning of the week, so that's kind of due to this.
NEUT27|However, today was massively up, so potentially on tomorrow's news or tomorrow's everything going on in the global economy.
NEUT28|We can see if it if it pushed through 453.
NEUT29|So potentially we have two really close resistance is so.
NEUT30|This might get rejected back down and training this channel because it has been trading in this channel pretty much besides this little section here for the last couple of days now.
NEUT31|So potentially it might.
BULL32|It might have enough momentum now to to break up and above this for 57 level also.
NEUT33|So I'm excited to see what happens next for Apple.
NEUT34|Especially after the stock split actually happens and see this 457 turning into a little over 100.
BULL35|Potentially, we'll have another another push upwards.
NEUT36|Because that would.
NEUT37|That would be the actual time where all these other people who can't afford the $400 stock will be able to buy their shares.
NEUT38|So it'll be pretty interesting until then.
