NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video for Monday, April 27th and Christina Bertha, new investment analyst, exam.com."
NEUT1|Taking a look at Dollar Yen on the four hour chart.
BEAR2|So looking at the chart, the pair came under selling pressure relief today, which technically looks reasonable given the close below the symmetrical triangle there aside, the Stochastics and Mike D are currently all pointing down within the bearish area, so I expect additional losses in the short term unless this month key support level.
BULL3|Of 106.90, manage is to provide strong footing once again, even more than the pair hold reactivate the downward pattern of the 111.70 peak, pushing support towards the 106.43 level, which is how the 50% Fibonacci of the applet from 101 point 17211.70 are.
BEAR4|Below that I expect a steeper decline to take place until the 61.8% Fibo Nachi of 105.19.
NEUT5|In case of an upside reversal.
BULL6|Now I would like to see a rally above the 107.60 barrier which is.
BULL7|A slightly below the 38.2% hibachi and more importantly I would like to see a close above the descending trendline which could take us up to 107.94.
BULL8|I'm moving higher.
BULL9|The next step could be somewhere around 108.45 though to fully eliminate fears of a downtrending market, the price should top above the hundred 909.40 area.
NEUT10|So that's it from me.
BULL11|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
