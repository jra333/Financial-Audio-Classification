NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, April 12th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina Nicholas technical analyst.
NEUT3|Wrexham.com today will look at Dollar Yen on the daily chart so you can see USD.
BEAR4|JPY has fallen below the key 110 level that happened yesterday Tuesday and this has increased the bearish bias.
BEAR5|So following Tuesday's break below this 110 level, the pair extended losses.
NEUT6|Ann is currently challenging an important area.
NEUT7|The 50% fib annachi level.
NEUT8|This is a retrace the 50% retracement of the recent up.
NEUT9|Like that took place from the 100 area in September all the way up to 118.65 in December.
NEUT10|So this level currently is at 109.36 and then below this the 200 day moving average around 108 point.
BULL11|80 It's now target if there is increased downside momentum.
BEAR12|If we look at the momentum indicators are sites it's embarrassed territory below 50, but it's been little change in the last couple of weeks.
BEAR13|Just hovering above 30 and so it's not quite oversold yet.
BEAR14|An Mike D. It's also in bearish territory below 0, but also flat, so the lack of direction and the momentum indicators suggests that the market could consolidate for now.
BEAR15|But the bar is bearish.
BEAR16|Bias remains unless prices can move back above at least A1112 level.
BULL17|This would bring a more neutral bias for dollar yen and then then move above the top of the cloud and a break above this high of 115.49.
NEUT18|That was March 10th.
BULL19|I break above these areas would bring a resumption of the uptrend that began from the 100 level area in September.
BULL20|Thanks so much for watching.
BULL21|"Have a great day."""
