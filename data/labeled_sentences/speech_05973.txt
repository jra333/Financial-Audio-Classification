NEUT0|"""OK Market Timing Academy here with your weekly stock analysis."
NEUT1|Today is September 27th.
NEUT2|We're going to take a look at Netflix.
NEUT3|One of the companies that we recommended here awhile back in my objective here is to show you how you should trade this.
NEUT4|If you already own it, an if you don't own it, I'm going to show you where you might have a potential by point to get into this so you don't miss the run now you can see we originally highlighted this stock when it broke out of a nice little base back here in February.
BEAR5|You can see the stock had a major gap to the upside which was right through this area.
NEUT6|And most importantly, it had that gap on very high volume.
NEUT7|Now what's going on with Netflix is Netflix.
NEUT8|Is is the company that just put candidly blockbuster into bankruptcy.
NEUT9|They've changed the way that we want Entertainment delivered to us.
NEUT10|We don't want to go to the retail store anymore.
NEUT11|We want to pull this stuff offline and have it download directly to our TV.
NEUT12|Well, you know what they are, the company that's delivering that technology to us.
BEAR13|And so when this stock broke out, you saw we had a very, very significant run to the upside right through here.
NEUT14|Now, the area that we highlighted.
NEUT15|The second time was right through this basing.
NEUT16|And this was back in the July August time frame are by point that we that we highlighted to get into the stock was as the stock cross through this prior high in the midpoint of the base and that by point was right here at roughly $125 a share and that again was back in August about August 16th.
NEUT17|Now that move and that by point most importantly came on very significant volume and it also came when the Mac D was breaking through the zero line, so all positive stuff that you look.
BULL18|For with the stock that's getting ready to make a good move now since then, this stock has been up.
BULL19|Oh gosh, it's been up about 35%.
NEUT20|It's at roughly $266 a share.
NEUT21|We're in $125 a share, and the stock is making this move on very, very good volume with with good mcdee movement here and so at this point typically we would suggest that you sell.
NEUT22|The stock will be anytime you're up over 25%.
NEUT23|We recommend you take profits.
NEUT24|No reason to become a pig and get greedy.
NEUT25|But in this case, the stock has moved so fast, so quickly or so high, so quickly that that usually is an indicator that this company wants to make a more significant move to the upside.
NEUT26|And So what our suggestion is, is you keep your stops close.
NEUT27|If you own this stock, so you make sure that you protect the gains that you have, and if you're a person that did not get into this stock when we recommended it back here, our suggestion is to hold tight.
BEAR28|The stock is going to be in a good confirmed uptrend, but a lot of the time stocks like this will pull back to their 50 day moving average.
NEUT29|That's where you want to enter the stock, so as long as the stock market is still in a confirmed uptrend.
BULL30|And this stock pulls back to that 50 day moving average, and Netflix is in good condition.
NEUT31|Fundamentally, you can enter the trade at that point if you already own it.
BULL32|Congratulations, you're making good money.
NEUT33|Keep your stops tight and and ride this sucker.
BULL34|'cause when a stock makes a move like it did on good volume on both of these in the Mac, D is acting well.
