NEUT1|I really want to make sure that you guys are using all of its features and functions.
NEUT2|There's a lot of different little parts of extra that I found that people don't even realize are there.
NEUT3|So here I did.
NEUT4|I search for collagen peptides powder.
NEUT5|I'm going to click on our Chrome extension.
NEUT6|I'm going to hit X Ray and the first thing that I want to show you guys is the search volume.
NEUT7|You don't have to even go to our helium 10 dashboard to get the search volume for this keyword.
NEUT8|This keyword, collagen peptides powder is search for 2054 times per month and this data is coming directly from Amazon.
NEUT9|This is not Google search data or anything else like that.
NEUT10|This is directly from Amazon.
NEUT11|The second thing I want to show you guys how you can click right here on the sales chart.
NEUT12|Yeah, here visually you can just see you know it's going up and down, but I want to actually go day by day.
NEUT13|I can do that.
NEUT14|I just click on here.
NEUT15|It brings up a new day, a new data chart here.
NEUT16|And I can see day by day the estimate of the sales that is doing here on Sept.
NEUT17|Excuse me, September 12, did about 30 sales here on September 29th, still doing about 30.
NEUT18|But I can go back 90 days.
NEUT19|I can go back one year or I can go back all time and I can actually see.
NEUT20|Maybe when the first day that he had recorded sales and that was on.
NEUT21|Let's see here October 9th, 2017 this guy stayed pretty steady.
NEUT22|You know since then you can see like he had some big days on certain days.
NEUT23|Might have done a giveaway or something.
NEUT24|But you have that historical sales data right here.
NEUT25|By clicking on that chart, the other thing that you can click on is the BSR.
NEUT26|So let's say I want to see the Zhou nutrition what their BS.
NEUT27|Our history is like.
BEAR28|So I click here on the bar chart and it defaults to 30 days.
BEAR29|I can see, OK, their price has stayed about the same 2789 for the bybox.
BULL30|Pretty pretty, pretty good here.
NEUT31|As you can see that's right here.
BEAR32|Their sales rank is going up and down a little bit, you know they had a really nice spike right here on the 20th of September, but it stays steady around.
NEUT33|1500 and the list price you know does not change has not changed.
NEUT34|I can look back at 24 hours, you know, even even today you know what the last 24 hours you know trends is happening.
NEUT35|Or again I can go to all time to see where you know what the data looks like about the price changes.
