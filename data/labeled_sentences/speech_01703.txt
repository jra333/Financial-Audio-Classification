BEAR0|"""The pound has fallen more than 12% since Brexit."
BEAR1|Well, that's bad news for many.
BULL2|It's also beneficial for some.
NEUT3|Here's a guide to the winners and losers from Sterling Slump.
NEUT4|Let's get those few winners out of the way first.
BEAR5|UK exporters Sterling slide makes British goods more competitive.
BULL6|Many markets would love their currencies to be more competitive and have cut rates or furiously rolled out quantitative easing to achieve it.
NEUT7|That's not something the Bank of England has had to do yet.
BULL8|The UK domestic tourism industry is a likely winner.
BEAR9|How fortunate that the pound has weakened just as hotels, restaurants and other leisure industry businesses wonder how to attract overseas tourists for the summer season.
BEAR10|Mind you, so sour is the UK national mood that perhaps tourists might be wary of coming to the UK at all.
NEUT11|However Cheeps its attractions now are the fullback bouquet tourism is that Brits are now faced with far more expensive Holidays abroad, particularly in Europe, so they may as well holiday.
BEAR12|At home, hedge funds are likely winner several appear to have kept their powder dry in the run, up to Brexit, waiting to see the outcome.
NEUT13|Now they are loading up with bets against the pound and UK company shares.
NEUT14|And here is the long list of losers topped the list.
BULL15|The UK economy, yes, a weaker pound helps UK exporters, but they're bigger.
BEAR16|Impact is the hit to confidence in the UK economy, particularly among international investors.
BEAR17|If capital inflows dry up.
BEAR18|The ability for the UK to serve its chronically high current account deficit will be severely constrained.
BEAR19|The pound is also hitting companies.
BEAR20|Bank stocks are down as the value of their Sterling earnings decline.
BEAR21|UK small companies are paralyzed by uncertainty and not many of them are exporters, and housebuilders are suffering from buyers pulling out of deals because of uneasiness.
BEAR22|Car drivers may soon find petrol prices going up.
NEUT23|The UK is a net importer of.
NEUT24|Oil after all, which is priced in U.S. dollars.
BEAR25|So Sterling weakness makes oil more expensive.
BEAR26|On the other hand, the worldwide price of oil has fallen since Brexit, so that's an offsetting.
NEUT27|Peter.
BEAR28|Finally, other currencies are being hit.
BEAR29|The euro and other European currencies are down as confidence in the single currency takes a hit.
BEAR30|All the experts expect the pound to continue to slide.
BULL31|"So expect all that list of losers to grow."""
