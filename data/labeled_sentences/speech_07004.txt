NEUT0|"""What's up, rich people, it's me."
NEUT1|Haley AKA Mrs Dow Jones.
BEAR2|Even though the economy is truly in a downward spiral right now, like with Great Depression level, vibes of unemployment, and there's a trade war popping off with China and there's mass, civil unrest.
NEUT3|The stock market is literally listening to create an keeps being like can you take me higher?
NEUT4|The disconnect between the economy and the stock market is puzzling, the same way it's puzzling that Courtney is being optimistic about Scott, even though his current situation is like quite ominous.
NEUT5|But like investors in the stock market, Kourtney Kardashian is peering into the future and seeing a Scott Disick OK, an economy that is beginning to recover confused, let me explain.
NEUT6|OK, so the stock market and the economy are really different.
NEUT7|One grew up in Beverly Hills and with family friends with OJ and the other Long Island JK.
NEUT8|That is Kourtney and Scott, but the stock market in the economy are super different to the stock market is all about the future and the economy is all about what is happening right now and what has happened in the past.
BEAR9|The disconnect, or as I like to call it the disconnect can be really confusing, especially in times like right now of economic honras like it's truly bizarre to go on Twitter and see that unemployment rates are 20% and then also see that the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ are crushing it.
NEUT10|And you know what?
BEAR11|It's also bizarre to see Scott and Kourtney on vacation together like didn't he just drop out of rehab?
NEUT12|What happened with Sofia Richie?
NEUT13|Is Courtney really gluten free?
NEUT14|But when you understand that investors in the stock market like Kourtney Kardashian are betting on the future an are forward looking.
NEUT15|This all makes sense.
BULL16|She is betting that Scott, like the economy, is going to recover.
NEUT17|Investors are not just pulling their money out of the market the same way that Scott did not pull out of Courtney.
NEUT18|Now they have three kids.
NEUT19|OK, so now that you understand that Courtney, like investors in the stock market, is optimistic.
NEUT20|Let's look at the facts.
NEUT21|Like what evidence do we really have that things are going to bounce back and buy things?
BULL22|I mean, Scott and the economy well, for one, the stimulus payments from the Federal Reserve really helped.
NEUT23|The economy basically went to rehab, just like Scott.
NEUT24|Also, the country is like sort of starting to reopen, which has investors feeling like maybe the worst is over, right Scott, the worst is over.
NEUT25|We talked about this but yeah, even though all of this makes sense, there's still some glaring question marks that make it hard to completely buy into Scott's recovery and the economy's recovery.
NEUT26|But I guess that's part of the fun.
NEUT27|Like we keep Scott around and we keep investing in the market because in some way we like the uncertainty.
NEUT28|It makes us feel alive and also dividends abcdefg.
