NEUT0|"""Hi Matt Farmer contribute here at The Motley Fool today."
NEUT1|Like talk about one stock that I like in the coal industry.
BEAR2|We recently saw a number of different things come out and holding your coal stocks really get hammered.
BEAR3|The GDP growth in China falling and how that's going to affect demand for the coal in the country.
NEUT4|We also heard Obama talking about how he wants to have the EPA and really wants some regulation crackdown on carbon carbon emissions from coal fired power plants.
BULL5|With all that said, I think there is still one place and still one company in the industry that any investor can get in and probably do well with in long run.
NEUT6|Let's look at the Peabody will look at Peabody, Consult Energy, Natural Alpha, Natural Resources and Arch Coal out of the four of am I can say there's one that I really like, but let's go through each one real quick.
NEUT7|Peabody to me.
NEUT8|While they are the biggest or have the most revenue coming in every month or yearly basis.
NEUT9|They also have the largest.
NEUT10|Amount of debt.
NEUT11|It's around $6 billion.
BEAR12|Currently an free cash flow being under a billion really makes me concerned with slow down man dropping coal prices.
NEUT13|How they're going to service that debt in long run so that one I'm scratching that off the board.
BEAR14|Alpha Natural Resources and Arch Coal, both fairly smaller smaller companies, not nearly as much high revenue or anything like that, but some problems.
BEAR15|There is a they have negative running negative margins right now and there also.
BEAR16|They're both also running a negative return on equity, which again scares me, especially if we start seeing a slowdown with demand in a drop in coal prices.
NEUT17|So the one stock that I am looking at a I do kind of like right now is consult energy.
NEUT18|Their balance sheet.
BULL19|Better than the other two.
NEUT20|They run in the not negative.
NEUT21|Anything really, they have a little bit of debt, but it's not too scary.
NEUT22|It's not too massive, but what really excites me about Consolan?
NEUT23|What really gets my interest is the fact that the diversified into natural gas, if we do see a decline in corporate in call, and we see the client in coal prices and natural or.
NEUT24|Klein in energy utility companies using coal burning power plants consulting swoop right in and they have a natural gas plant so they can basically take their customers that they were selling coal two and step right in and start selling natural gas.
NEUT25|Without changing vendors without changing anything, making it very seamless for the client and the customer, this really sparked my interest in the company's been doing this for a number of years.
NEUT26|They diversified a number of years ago and really started moving into this something.
NEUT27|This isn't something that they just started yesterday or just started a couple of months ago.
NEUT28|They're really good at it and they know what they're doing.
NEUT29|Their intelligent.
NEUT30|Like I said their balance sheet.
BEAR31|Everything else looks good, and if we do see it slide in coal prices and everything like that, the company shouldn't be hurt as dramatically as the other three.
NEUT32|"That's all I have today for more about the industry coal industry check outfour.com"""
