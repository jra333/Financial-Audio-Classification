NEUT0|"""Is skinny and a weekly top 50 welcome back is a 30th of March 2021, Tuesday the 2nd day of the week."
NEUT1|We're at #28.
NEUT2|Are you talk with the teacher or Utah for your targets BC we have a target over here 0.9.
NEUT3|403 Five 3500 Satoshis, roughly, are we going to get high?
BEAR4|I don't know, because we really spots a double bearish divergance on my hotel, higher high on the price, lower high or not make D lower high under RSI, so which means that potentially we could be.
NEUT5|Correcting back twister downside.
NEUT6|So you need to be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT7|Alright, we may not even hit targets that we may just stop falling from here.
NEUT8|We may get a triple bearish divergance first before dropping, but I don't think now is the time to be going into biota.
NEUT9|Absolutely not.
NEUT10|So be very careful about going to a trade too, so let's move on to other targets USD.
NEUT11|But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT12|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about my order comments below.
NEUT13|Yes, why your target.
NEUT14|Do we have a target at $2.10?
BEAR15|But right now we had $1.51 an that's really double bearish divergance.
NEUT16|Do you see Boise boys and girls?
NEUT17|Do you see it?
BEAR18|Here is a lower high on Monday.
BULL19|Lower higher on the RSI but higher high under price, so double bearish divergance.
NEUT20|We could still crawl our way.
NEUT21|To get a triple bearish divergance right triple cumulative debt.
NEUT22|Then when you do we start reversing.
NEUT23|If you look at weekly.
NEUT24|This is radio shooting star and shooting stars are reversal candle sticks, so the end in my opinion is near for iota against USD.
NEUT25|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT26|Alright, so I guess it from Iota Nicole analysis now is not the time to be buying now is actually selling season so be careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT27|Alright, be careful.
