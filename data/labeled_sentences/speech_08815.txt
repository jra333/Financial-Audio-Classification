NEUT0|"""We are expected to see where shares are going price ahead of their IPO tomorrow, Emily."
NEUT1|So what's the latest we're hearing on the door dash front?
NEUT2|That's right Jack.
NEUT3|We are going to be getting that pricing for door Dash's initial public offering tonight after market close and that stock is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow morning.
BULL4|Now last Friday, DoorDash had raised the price range for its stock offering, saying it would market 33 million shares for between $90.00 and $95 apiece.
BULL5|That's up from its previous range of between $75 and $85 per share.
NEUT6|Now that suggests that on the high end or Nash is going to be raising $3.1 billion and have a fully diluted valuation.
NEUT7|Of $35 billion, including those stock options and restricted stock units, now it is taking a look at door dash here you were just talking about Uber eats and that being a competitor here in the space DoorDash is the market leader here in the US.
BULL8|It had a market share lead of nearly twenty points ahead of Uber eats back in April at the height of those stay in place orders.
BULL9|Of course, a ton of competition here and a race really snap up market share in this food delivery space.
NEUT10|Given the increased demand that we've had over the course of 2020, so will be interesting to see.
NEUT11|What demand looks like on that front?
NEUT12|And then I also want to highlight that we are going to be getting the pricing an initial trade of another public offering later this week.
NEUT13|And that's for Air BNB and that is also going to be one of this year's largest IPOs.
BULL14|Another one of the most highly anticipated and for that company in particular.
BULL15|We're looking to see Air BNB raise as much as $3.1 billion or potentially the same amount as DoorDash after marketing more than 51 million shares in its IPO for between $56 and $68.
NEUT16|A share now Air B&B had also range the range of raised the range of that IPO as well earlier this week and is taking a look at the valuation that Air B&B is likely going to be fetching on the high end.
BULL17|That implies a fully diluted valuation of $42 billion, a big increase here from what we saw.
NEUT18|The company last fetch in the private markets at $18 billion in April and even back in 2017 before the Pandemic Air B&B have been valued at about $31 billion.
BEAR19|So even given some of the the damage that the company has seemed to its business.
BULL20|"Over the course of the pandemic, still seeing potentially a lot of demand here for this IPO and for door Dash is, we'll see how that shapes up tomorrow and Thursday."""
