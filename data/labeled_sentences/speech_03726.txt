NEUT1|No, Alex in the morning before drawing the market on the morning show I had given couple of banking names and both of them were completely contrary and ISIS are banking Canara Bank.
BULL2|So you know with the theme that I'm expecting account recovery on the banking index so that has played out really well.
NEUT3|Now I believe I'll focus more on individual stock theme.
NEUT4|So to buy calls which I want to suggest that this are the first one is about Pedialyte Industries.
NEUT5|It's a very interesting chart because when you look at it over the span of the last 5-6 months the stock had gone through a rally from 1500 to 1800.
NEUT6|Three months of consolidation and then finally a break out of that.
NEUT7|1800 marketing.
NEUT8|20 mark of this consolidation.
BULL9|So the last two days have been very fruitful for Pedialyte.
BULL10|Yesterday's momentum was very strong.
BULL11|I believe that this is a sign of a very strong uptake, probably at least 5200 point update from current levels on a positional basis.
NEUT12|So it was a high probability trade for big light industries.
NEUT13|So which address to buy with a target of at least 1950 stoppers could be kept at approximately 1860 mark.
NEUT14|The second is from the mid cap name.
BULL15|Real industry is now the stock, which had done exceedingly well in January to January 2021, remained a bit low, managed to go through corrective phase, but again making a very strong comeback was very intriguing.
NEUT16|About the charge for Industries is the strong volume push which you've got in the last two days.
BULL17|So yesterday the volumes are almost at a five day high or five day average high, and today the volume, so you know I've already surpassed yesterday's volumes so that.
BULL18|Itself is an indicator that there is a very strong demand which is coming across 4 industries.
NEUT19|"Would suggest to buy with the position target of at least 175 to 180 range and stop loss could be kept at 157."""
