BEAR0|"""It appears that there is still some big sell walls, but not near as bad as it was in the regular market hours."
NEUT1|Here's a hypothesis for you.
NEUT2|Here's a hypothesis I get asked this all the time straight.
NEUT3|Why do you think that AMC and GameStop running the after hours in the pre market?
NEUT4|Here's my answer.
NEUT5|I think that the algorithm system that shorting that takes place right, that laddering down, or you've got these penny by penny by penny by penny increments of a couple thousand shares that drive the stock price down right?
NEUT6|I don't think you have that same sort of selling pressure that takes place in the after hours of the pre market.
NEUT7|Which means this people can make purchases during the regular market hours and it gets dropped down.
NEUT8|People make purchases during the after hours or the pre market and it's not being matched by this selling pressure coming in from a couple thousand shares.
NEUT9|They gotta work through with each freaking penny of shorting right?
NEUT10|I mean look at this right now.
BULL11|You get a level twos as compared to two minutes ago.
NEUT12|It doesn't have that same freaking exact same size across that couple pennies spread from you know five or six seven cents of the exact same size that you're getting from shorting, right?
NEUT13|So people can make purchases and it actually affects the stock price.
NEUT14|I think that's what's going on.
NEUT15|With with with the actual purchases here in the after hours.
NEUT16|That's why it's actually moving now.
NEUT17|I mean, look at this almost nowhere near as much size you had 6000 shares here.
NEUT18|9000 shares here, and it's moving because there's no sellers or shorts waiting orders filled in the same way that's nuts.
NEUT19|I mean, you saw we saw it, we saw that crazy spreads happening on the ASK and the bid both sides.
NEUT20|I mean, it's not fun to say because it's our it's our side.
NEUT21|It's our team, but this is important.
NEUT22|There's manipulation.
NEUT23|I think happening on both sides long and short.
NEUT24|Belongings are winning right now.
BEAR25|I mean, we're winning because the stock price is going up, the shorts are losing.
BEAR26|Shorts are definitely losing.
NEUT27|And it happened.
BEAR28|I mean, we saw on the bid their incremental penny spreads in the bid as well, but they just they were just losing for the majority of the day today.
BULL29|Unfortunately, we so lit up green though, and that's what matters were up 1% the after hours.
NEUT30|Right now, sitting at 1406 will stick around for a little while.
NEUT31|You guys are really wondering about that.
NEUT32|$14.00 close.
BULL33|I mean, it looks like it's starting a little bit of movement here guys.
NEUT34|This is what I'm talking about.
NEUT35|Look at this.
NEUT36|The cell walls aren't the same.
NEUT37|You know the same short walls coming into the stock.
NEUT38|That's huge.
BULL39|It's actually getting a little bit of movement here.
NEUT40|I'm interested to see I am very fascinated.
NEUT41|I'm wondering if we're going to push.
NEUT42|For 1425 or 1450, at some point today in the after hours here, I would not be surprised in the least bit.
BEAR43|"That would be very fascinate."""
