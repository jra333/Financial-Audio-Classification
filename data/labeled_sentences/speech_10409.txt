BEAR0|"""As we said earlier, Uber shares are down in the pre market."
BEAR1|London's Transit Authority says it will not renew the company's license to operate in that city, citing several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk.
BEAR2|Huber is vowing to appeal that decision just hours ago, Derrick Coaster Shahe tweeted, we understand we're held to a high bar as we should be, but this TfL decision is just wrong.
NEUT3|Over the last two years, we have fundamentally changed how we operate in London.
BULL4|We've come very far and we will keep going for the millions of drivers and riders who rely on us.
NEUT5|About 45,000 drivers top five market.
NEUT6|SunTrust thinks it's maybe 5% of global rides book.
NEUT7|Anyone who's used him in London knows it's kind of the.
NEUT8|It's very inexpensive versus the rest versus the traditional kind of Guild.
NEUT9|That's a Guild over there.
NEUT10|For taxi drivers and they're really busting it, so it's a little different from here in New York or from other cities where the incumbents didn't have a lot of favor of the customers does matter it does every time this stock seems to begin in the slightest bit of momentum.
NEUT11|There seem to be at least some.
BULL12|Positive sense in the analyst community that they had sort of turned a corner a bit, I mean.
BEAR13|With the stock down as much as it was, it just something else happens.
BULL14|Very good point, and here we are again.
NEUT15|I mean, this is one of the most significant markets they have without a doubt.
NEUT16|Worth noting, Travis Kalanick sold so much stock.
NEUT17|Do people love this startup billion and a half dollars worth of stock?
NEUT18|I think he still owns another 140,000,000 so shares.
NEUT19|But he's so basically at the stop in in a very short amount of time.
NEUT20|You have 45 little less than 45 million shares.
NEUT21|What he has left.
NEUT22|People say that a big vote of confidence.
BULL23|People saying some kind of gentler Travis he's back in favor out there.
NEUT24|You can call me.
NEUT25|Well, there had been this whole story of maybe Travis will one day do a poll.
NEUT26|Steve Jobs, you know.
NEUT27|I mean Travis and or I think he's changed from the day that he met me after speaking with my wife and said I am so much richer than you are, which I regard is kind of.
NEUT28|It's your favorite.
NEUT29|Travis Story was shipped to me.
BEAR30|It's kind of it is kind of jarring that someone just comes up to you and say, hi, I am much richer than you, it's just shows it's a showstopper.
NEUT31|Corn only met him after he sort of had become a little more humble.
NEUT32|Now I got the full board.
NEUT33|Travis Scott.
NEUT34|Dale Carnegie man, what do you do?
NEUT35|What do you do with Uber stock?
NEUT36|I think you buy Lyft now.
BULL37|I actually think that Uber is coming close to a level.
NEUT38|I want to talk with him because Huber Freight has done unbelievable things.
NEUT39|Huber is here to stay Lexus.
NEUT40|It's yours day.
NEUT41|So there is some value to try to figure out what value it's got.
NEUT42|The SoftBank discount.
NEUT43|You know that matters.
NEUT44|Nelson Chai last week saying they'll get out of each markets where they're not position number one or #2 well then maybe they get.
NEUT45|Does that mean what are they going to do with with Uber eats, which is what matters so much?
NEUT46|I mean, DoorDash is playing with, you know, funny money.
NEUT47|At the gaining share.
NEUT48|"Only ones gaining share DoorDash Gameshare by just suddenly becoming your provider without you knowing."""
