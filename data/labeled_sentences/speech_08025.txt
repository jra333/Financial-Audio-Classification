NEUT0|"""Hey there, I'm Brian Hickman, senior analyst with Motley Fool Pro and Molly."
NEUT1|Full options.
NEUT2|I'm here today to answer a question for the Ask a full series and today we've got a question that comes from Facebook or any earnest Acosta asks what is the whole commotion about stock options trading.
NEUT3|I see the benefits, extreme risks, and potential, but is the benefit really worth the risk?
NEUT4|I see people advertise it as a get rich quick scheme.
NEUT5|Well, Ernest, you've really got three questions here in this one question segment, but I'll try my best to tackle them.
NEUT6|The first question you ask is why options?
NEUT7|Well, people normally use options for three reasons.
NEUT8|First being, they're incredibly versitile.
NEUT9|You can use them to generate income to hedge a position or to leverage your particular take.
NEUT10|The second reason people use options is because they enable freedom.
NEUT11|Options are contracts that allow you to define your risk and define your reward, and that's incredibly empowering.
NEUT12|The third reason people use options is as a tool to combat market gyrations.
NEUT13|Basically what this means is the market zigs, your portfolio may zag if you employ options instead, so these are three really important reasons to at least consider using options now are options worth it?
NEUT14|I'm a little biased here because I work on a service called Motley Fool Options, so my answer is heck, yeah they are, except that they're only worth it if you're an options investor rather than an options trader.
NEUT15|And what the heck does that mean?
NEUT16|Well, being and options investor means that you understand the business that underlies each each option.
NEUT17|An option is just a contract that gets its value from.
BULL18|The underlying business, whether the underlying business improves or deteriorates.
NEUT19|So if you're going to make a call on the underlying business, then that puts you in the camp of being an options investor as opposed to someone who's just trying to use leverage.
NEUT20|And it is an options trader now.
NEUT21|The third question you ask about here is you see them.
NEUT22|You see options often sold as a get rich quick scheme, and here ioffer you a word of caution.
NEUT23|If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
NEUT24|However, if you're an options investor.
BULL25|That can mean sensible returns, sensible risk, and a great tool to add to your portfolio.
BULL26|"Ernest, thanks for asking your question today full on."""
