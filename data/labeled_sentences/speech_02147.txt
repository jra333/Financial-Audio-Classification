BEAR0|"""Since last summer, the US stock market has been on a stomach churning ride."
NEUT1|So surely it is time for some comfort food.
BULL2|Defensive stocks telecoms, utilities, consumer staples have been doing very nicely since the Long bull market turned into a 0 sum amusement park ride.
BULL3|Food stocks in particular have done well.
BULL4|Tyson Foods, Hormel Post and Campbell Soup are all among the best performers in the S&P.
NEUT5|And this makes good sense.
BULL6|These companies and many of their peers provide slow but steady revenue growth.
NEUT7|People do tend to keep eating whatever else may be happening.
BULL8|As well as ample free cash flow yields of 4% and above.
NEUT9|A tasty way to sock money away when the 10 year bond yield is under 2%.
NEUT10|This is why the food stocks all trade at historically high valuations relative to profits.
NEUT11|Have a good look before digging in though.
NEUT12|The biggest of all the food companies with an enterprise value of 125 billion is Kraft Heinz and it is not like the others.
BULL13|It is a growth story.
BULL14|Earnings are expected to rise over 30% this year, but like its peers, its revenue growth is somewhere between little and none.
BULL15|The growth is coming from expanding margins in the fourth quarter of last year, Kraft Heights reported an operating margin of 24%.
BULL16|Compared to 15% a year earlier.
BULL17|And analysts think margins will expand to 29% next year.
BEAR18|That is remarkable, given that margins in the rest of the industry are much lower.
NEUT19|Snack King Mandal is at 13% cereal giant General Mills 17%, Campbells 15 and so on.
NEUT20|Size surely helps, and Kraft Heinz is the biggest.
NEUT21|Having been born in a merger orchestrated by the famously astute cost cutters.
NEUT22|Of 3G capital.
NEUT23|So maybe it has discovered sources of efficiency that smaller peers are missing.
NEUT24|In addition to just sacking people.
NEUT25|Crafton Heights employed about 54,000 people.
NEUT26|Craft Heights employs 42,000.
BEAR27|One might fairly wonder, though, whether 3G levels of leanness can be sustained without damaging sales growth or the reputation of the company's brands.
NEUT28|There might be a special sauce here.
NEUT29|"But it might just be ketchup."""
