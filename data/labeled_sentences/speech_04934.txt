NEUT0|"""What's up everyone?"
NEUT1|It's Levi from Wall Street survivor today I'm going to give you guys my honest review of the popular Motley Fool Rule Breaker newsletter.
NEUT2|You might have heard of The Motley Fool before.
NEUT3|They have two of the best stock picking newsletters on the market.
NEUT4|The first Motley Fool stock advisor has been one of our favourites here at Wall Street Survivor.
NEUT5|So much so that we wrote a full review on it that's updated twice a month with real time returns.
NEUT6|Check out our review article an video on the Wall Street Survivor blog.
NEUT7|Today, though, we're talking about The Motley Fool for a different reason.
NEUT8|That reason is there rule Breakers newsletter the Rulebreakers newsletter specifically targets high growth stocks, and we're about to tell you what we think about how it does.
NEUT9|First of all, let's break down what rule Breakers does when you sign up for rule Breakers, you get 2 new stock recommendations and an updated best stocks to buy.
NEUT10|Now list every month these stock picks get sent directly to your inbox.
NEUT11|You also get access to exclusive rulebreakers content, including your own dashboard of the Rule Breakers stock picks.
NEUT12|Each pick is broken down, and The Motley Fool authors explain their recommendation reasoning an update with ongoing analysis.
NEUT13|Pretty simple and straightforward, but you're probably still wondering how good are their stock picks.
NEUT14|Well to start, here's a graphic of their performance versus the S&P since 2009.
BULL15|As you can see, during the latest bull run the Rule Breakers stock picks average an overall return of 144% versus the S&P S 67% in the same.
NEUT16|Here's a snapshot of some of their topics and how they've performed since Rulebreakers suggest them.
NEUT17|Now.
NEUT18|We're not saying every pic is going to yield multiple 100 or 1000% returns, but regardless, it's clear their picks are legitimate.
NEUT19|Keep in mind, anytime you make an investment, there is inevitable risk.
NEUT20|The Rulebreakers services much more volatile than the stock Advisor newsletter referenced earlier because it targets high growth stocks.
BEAR21|When they get it right, the stocks skyrocket, but every year there's a few bad apples.
BULL22|After analyzing their pics from the past years, we realized that out of 24 picks a year.
BULL23|Usually about four don't end the year with a positive return, but overall the average return of their 24 picks has been better than stock advisors every single year.
NEUT24|So we've talked about what Rulebreakers is, and we've shown some different aspects of its historical performance.
NEUT25|But how much does it cost?
NEUT26|Well, last year Motley Fool Soda year subscription for $299.
NEUT27|And that's a lot of money.
NEUT28|But if you click on the link in the description of this video, it's only $99 a year.
NEUT29|Or if you want to pay monthly $19.00 a month.
BULL30|Definitely worth it.
