NEUT0|"""I love your body."
NEUT1|I eats Jaguar speaking.
NEUT2|Thanks for joining approaching this quick video on Coca Cola stalkers.
BEAR3|So based on fundamental analysis, we know that the market has been a bull issue since yesterday, Monday due to lighting the positive, the positive ITI into the vaccine that might be found for the coronavirus, but then even be 'cause I think there have been a lot of restriction or.
BULL4|Lock down has been lifted and then there gonna be lifted a worldwide soon with the reopening of malls and you know shops so it's good.
BULL5|You know, good input for the economy.
BEAR6|So that's why I think all the economy yet list yesterday they jumped up a lot but there is still to see that there is a lot of unemployment around us.
NEUT7|There is still some concerns around the 2nd wave of coronavirus, so it's not really.
NEUT8|Actually sure that the markets are ready to go up, so I think I would be always cautious.
BULL9|There will be always sceptical before investing for long term investment, so starting from the point in going back to technical analysis, Coca Cola's been bullish market since our for variable.
NEUT10|This is we can say bullish trend and then the prices have been moving sideways forming this type of triangle is 90 triangles adjusted down a trendline bearish trendline.
NEUT11|Give me know showing that there is a weakness in the market and because this let's hit and run is being broken, it's possible to find the target price with doing an analogy with the triangle with the descending triangle.
NEUT12|This is not any disentangled because they sent the same triangle, works totally different ways.
NEUT13|So please don't get confused with the descending triangle by general.
NEUT14|If you wanted an allergy who just take this depth so the distance between these black line red line we project this step, the breakout point.
NEUT15|So if we project this step.
NEUT16|This breakout point.
NEUT17|We can find it almost approximately the target price is Chica 50 U.S. dollars, so this is where we're standing right now.
NEUT18|So there is an opportunity to go long by just waiting before going long.
NEUT19|This is our target price with taking analysis and a little bit of fundamental analysis.
BULL20|Even that there is some you know concerns around this virus, but it seems that the market reacting well so they they want to grow.
NEUT21|They want to go up, they want to start to go up so.
NEUT22|Based on those information and I would say that based on technical analysis again, that the Coca Cola my my go up to this level but just wait that the actually the stochastic is almost going in oversold.
NEUT23|Perhaps?
NEUT24|Let's wait a little bit difficult in oversold.
NEUT25|If we keep growing up, or perhaps we will go down over both would be great if we will go down over.
BEAR26|Sorry over and over.
NEUT27|In oversold and then we can go up so they said.
BEAR28|Sorry to confuse this one is going overboard.
NEUT29|So let's wait.
NEUT30|What's gonna happen if we were going over Bolton over so that it would be good if you go first little bit down in oversold and so it's good.
NEUT31|Good good time to buy an go longer, know?
NEUT32|Perhaps again you can.
NEUT33|You can stay in overseen overboard for even a couple of days, so without no problem so we can stay oversold, you know, and then the price can keep going up so.
NEUT34|So this is my point of interpretation of Coca Cola.
NEUT35|"Thanks bye."""
