NEUT0|"""The only real reason to own Bitcoin is speculation."
NEUT1|Chasing higher prices.
NEUT2|Tired today trading above $58,000.
NEUT3|Francisco Blanch is here.
NEUT4|He's the head of the Avaes global commodity and Derivatives research joins us now.
NEUT5|So the question is.
NEUT6|People may own it for speculative purposes, but at what point does does does the train ride end if you will?
NEUT7|If that's the case, right?
NEUT8|Right?
NEUT9|Well, look, I think at the end of the day Andrew this is about supply and demand.
BEAR10|We know the supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins.
NEUT11|The supply growth rate of Bitcoin is having every four years, so there is less and less big coming in.
NEUT12|So ultimately it's exactly what you said is when does the demand for the cryptocurrency stop growing?
NEUT13|And ultimately that's a question of adoption.
BEAR14|So if adoption starts to falter, I think prices are going to come down pretty quickly.
NEUT15|But if it, if it grows a lot more than we have a different problem, which is the energy consumption of crypto, which is one thing our report highlights is that prices at the end of the day drive energy demand Dr. CO2 emissions.
NEUT16|And the question is, do we really need to have such a polluting instrument at a time when when we're trying to essentially go to net zero emissions in 30 years here?
NEUT17|OK, but but I think the question that we should be asking here is, let's say it's a speculative instrument.
NEUT18|And by the way, I think it's almost impossible to say right now that it isn't.
NEUT19|But if you believe that it is some form of digital gold, it sounds to me like your view is that the current folks who have money in Bitcoin won't actually hold it when it gets to some kind of steady state that feels a little bit more like gold, because you'll think to yourself I don't have a 10X opportunity going going on in the future.
NEUT20|Therefore then I sell.
BEAR21|Therefore it pushes the stock down.
NEUT22|I'm asking you at what price does that happen?
NEUT23|Right, well, I mean, I think it's impossible to tell.
NEUT24|But one thing I would say about priceless in Bitcoin is that remember, in 2017 2018 we had a big run up in prices that was left largely by retail investors flowing in this time around, there's been a lot more institutional investors are coming through into into the market, and we also know there's a little hedge funds in this trade, so I think if the hedge funds somehow smell that there is downside risk, they're all going to try to get out and and the other thing that we observe from our.
NEUT25|From Bitcoin in our report is that it's driven by liquidity to the upside, and that's something unusual.
NEUT26|Most asset classes under you when there's more liquidity prices stabilize.
BULL27|In the case of Bitcoin, there's more liquidity and prices go up.
NEUT28|That's kind of a very, very peculiar of.
NEUT29|What do you think the downside risk is at $58,000.
NEUT30|Since I'm struggling to get you to give me an upper end of this, what's your lower end of this?
NEUT31|Well, I mean I the reason the reason why I can't do that is because we don't really have price targets in our report, so so we haven't really kind of come down to that.
NEUT32|But one way to think about those high risk in Bitcoin is the actual cost to produce it.
NEUT33|Remember it takes a lot of electricity, it takes our computer chips and today we think the cost of production of that Bitcoin.
NEUT34|The cost of mining, so to speak, is right around 20,000 for coins, so that sets.
NEUT35|In a way, some reference to the actual cost.
NEUT36|There's no real intrinsic value, but that's that's one.
NEUT37|One way to think about it.
