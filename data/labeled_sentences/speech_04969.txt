NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol NAKD."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, overall, the charts hanging in there keyword certainly being overall.
NEUT5|What do I mean by that?
NEUT6|Well, if you're some sort of daytrader flipper scalp, or you know whatever you want to call yourself and you decided that you bought, you know right there.
NEUT7|Or maybe you bought right there.
NEUT8|Who knows, maybe even bought this morning right there in your plan was to buy and sell within 7 minutes.
NEUT9|Well, then from that perspective the charts not looking very good for you at all, but from the overall standpoint the price is hanging in there and the quote unquote.
NEUT10|Hang in there point, we'll call it is right down here at the 15 cent mark.
NEUT11|Now if you watch past videos of mine, you've heard me talk about this level.
NEUT12|But $0.15 is important because that's literally showing and telling water, not the price is making progress, showing signs of strength, or if the prices you know literally just going back to where it was.
NEUT13|And I'm not saying this is what's going to ever actually happen, but just to illustrate my point here, let's say that the price actually does come down here to 15 behaves like that, and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT14|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT15|What would you have while you have a set of those there?
NEUT16|You'd have lows there.
NEUT17|You'd have lows there, and from you know.
NEUT18|Like I said, the big picture, the overall standpoint.
NEUT19|If you envision those stair steps would have, well, you'd have stairstep still making progress in the upward direction, and that's the name of the game.
NEUT20|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL21|It's going to make progress and show signs of progress, and that 15 cent mark is the point of progress.
NEUT22|'cause I mean, if the price would come down here and then just continue on down all of a sudden, what do you have?
NEUT23|Well, you have the price essentially going right back to where it was and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT24|But price movements like go back to where they were not exactly sound true power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT25|On the flip side of things, as far as areas of resistance are concerned, if there is any sort of attempted movement back to the upside that first key level right now in the very near term is going to be right there around that 21 cent mark.
NEUT26|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT27|But overall, yeah, not the greatest day.
NEUT28|However, like I said, big picture wise the price is hanging in there still got the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base, so let's see if the price can say about $0.15 or not.
BULL29|Moving forward First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR35|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
