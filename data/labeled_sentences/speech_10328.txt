NEUT0|"""What do we need to understand about what they said about reserve releases and sort of the near term uncertainty that's reflected in the reserves that are still there?"
NEUT1|Well, look, I look at JPMorgan like I look at all these City 2.
NEUT2|There's going to be a tale of two cities, which is that there's before the vaccine, and then after those City believes that it's going to roll out more slowly.
BEAR3|JPM, I'm just going to say this was one of the greatest quarters that I have ever seen, and the stock was justifiably up.
NEUT4|And then City reports, and people say that.
NEUT5|And then Wells Fargo reports and Charlie Sharp, who runs.
NEUT6|Wells Fargo is not a promoter.
NEUT7|He's an operator, and he told it like it is.
NEUT8|Which is?
BEAR9|He still is nowhere near where he wants to be, and that's why that stock is brought down.
NEUT10|David, when you have a CEO who is as blunt as Charlie Scharf.
NEUT11|And he says, we're not there.
NEUT12|You can't say he's there, and I think Charlie brought things down by being just yeah, but although Jamie Dimon is pretty blunt as well.
NEUT13|Yeah, I mean he you know you don't.
NEUT14|You don't get a lot of shading with him, know at all and they had a good quarter, right?
NEUT15|I mean, obviously reserve releases, right?
BULL16|Certainly helped.
NEUT17|But you think that the tone for the banks is going to be led by Wells Fargo, even though we all know Wells has been in a very different.
NEUT18|Set of circumstances.
BEAR19|Well, it would be wrong.
NEUT20|I mean, Wells isn't about to be.
BEAR21|I think the sanctions against wells are going to go away.
NEUT22|Sharp is fixing things.
NEUT23|But you know what?
NEUT24|Dovetail the retail sales David with?
NEUT25|What happened with these guys with all the banks people are not spending, they are saving OK, it is unprecedented saving.
BEAR26|So I think that it actually heard all these banks that hunk the hunkering down is not a good thing for a bank.
NEUT27|They need people to take a take a loan.
BULL28|Call we had the best balance sheets that we've seen in a long time.
NEUT29|I know that we have to do stimulus.
BEAR30|I wish it were targeted stimulus because it's really the people were out of work that needed.
BEAR31|Because if you look at the numbers from these three banks, the people who have jobs are doing fabulously and they're not spending 'cause there's nothing to spend on.
BEAR32|Although, well, Jim, look at JPM credit card spend Q4 down three.
BEAR33|Yeah, before that Q3 was down 8 and before that in Q2 is down 23.
NEUT34|So directionally the numbers are moving in the right direction.
NEUT35|Well yes, but I mean actually, cities, not.
NEUT36|I'd not as strong as that in terms of spend.
BULL37|I just think that what we all kind of felt at this point was that maybe the fourth quarter was robust for finance.
BULL38|Alright, we saw more deals.
NEUT39|There were incredible number of IPO's.
BEAR40|But it wasn't strong enough to offset even the 8% David.
NEUT41|I still think that the theme is vaccine vaccine vaccine.
NEUT42|Yeah, well, that's probably true.
BULL43|Let's not forget the financials have been incredibly strong since we're really since late November.
BULL44|Sort of after Thanksgiving, when JP Morgan increased and got the ability to increase their buyback significantly.
BEAR45|I mean, we've seen a huge rally off.
BEAR46|Of course, Lowe's and what was a terribly performing group for much of 2023 trading were not reopened yet.
NEUT47|That's the problem.
NEUT48|I mean 'cause right about the progression, but everybody bought these stocks saying you know what we gotta buy him now because of the reopening.
NEUT49|That's coming right and then this is a rude awakening 'cause you find out wow maybe I jumped the gun also net interest margins still plays an important role here in JP Morgan's income from net interest margin income is not going to be what it was even back in 2019 when you would imagine rates were not particularly high but they were higher.
NEUT50|Shepard Smith here.
