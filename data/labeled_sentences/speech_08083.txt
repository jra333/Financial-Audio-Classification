NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Paul Hickey of Bespoke investment group Paul."
BULL1|It's good to see you.
NEUT2|What are you watching?
BEAR3|So the stock it mean it's fallen 20% from a tie, which is considered a bear market.
NEUT4|From a technical perspective.
NEUT5|And given that Apple is the bigger than a lot of international benchmark indices at this point I that kind of measurement should be applied here.
BULL6|Stock did just bounce it its uptrend.
BEAR7|Yesterday we saw that nice reversal but it came.
BEAR8|The rally came up just short of its 50 day moving average and it still hasn't gotten above that level now.
NEUT9|So I think when you're looking at Apple here in the next few days are going to really tell you the direction of.
NEUT10|You know whether the stock is going to bounce or it's going to see what is a typical bear market for the stock, which would be an additional 18% downside from here and there were around 110.
NEUT11|I don't know if you know off the top your head where that 50 day is.
BULL12|So the 50 day is just under 111, so you know we've been, you know, we've been above and below that throughout the day, but I mean, when the NASDAQ up as much as it is today and Apple just hanging in there with a modest gain, it's it's not the type of momentum you wanted to see.
NEUT13|Follow through from yesterday's reversal, and there's two resets that could be happening here.
NEUT14|The one is the broader uptrend that you talked about.
NEUT15|The other is a valuation.
NEUT16|One, I mean Apple's price to earnings, multiple has expanded dramatically of late, and you say if it goes back to a market multiple, the share price would be under 84.
NEUT17|Yes, it was really interesting this for years.
NEUT18|We always compare to Apple to its valuation to the market and versus other sectors.
NEUT19|And we we often would say well if Apple is like a consumer staple stock and you know once Buffett got into it, it was very undervalued.
NEUT20|You look at the stock now.
BEAR21|If it was a consumer staple stock, it would have to trade down about 35% from current levels.
NEUT22|But versus the market overall would have to straight to the mid 90s.
BEAR23|The key takeaways things have changed for Apple.
NEUT24|I mean it has taken on more of a services approach and.
NEUT25|It's really embracing this subscription recurring revenue model, but it's not cheap stock that it was just even a year ago.
NEUT26|So even as we watch Apple battling it out here for direction pool or the other tech stocks at a similar junction.
NEUT27|Yeah, I think what we saw in July and August is tech just really got ahead of itself.
NEUT28|Not under, you know, with very little in the way of a fundamental driver behind it.
BEAR29|And I think we saw what we saw is 11 straight months of growth outperforming value, which is a record.
BEAR30|It's never happened before and now we're seeing some give back here, which up until yesterday growth was underperforming value by the most in a month since early 2001.
NEUT31|So we're seeing, you know, coming back down earlier and I think you know it.
BEAR32|"What the growth stocks do is going to be dependent on what the economy does here, and if we see it brought him out of the economy and economic strength that the growth stocks and large cap tech will suffer."""
