BULL0|"""Welcome back to a brand new video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about the Biohack Jordan one.
NEUT2|You guys probably know what I'm going to say about these person.
NEUT3|For most these are so ugly, but we're here to make money.
NEUT4|So where do I think these are going to go to give you the quick answer for this shoe you really want to wait?
NEUT5|I wouldn't say go crazy and put your money into this issue because I think these are going to drop down in price some more before they go up again.
NEUT6|Primarily the sizes that I'm looking at or three and a half to 7.
NEUT7|If you're new to sneaker investing, grade school is kind of the way for investing into Jordan ones.
NEUT8|They just go up quicker than Mens do.
NEUT9|Essentially.
NEUT10|Why say, wait is I just think market is too overpriced right now.
NEUT11|The biohacks don't look like a shoe that should be at 270 to like 300 on stock X.
BEAR12|That just doesn't seem realistic considering the fact that they released less than a month ago.
NEUT13|So my take on it was I'm personally going to wait when they first released.
NEUT14|I didn't even think about them.
NEUT15|I didn't look for any pairs.
NEUT16|I simply just waited and now I think it's the right time to put out a video and tell you guys wait even longer.
NEUT17|Most Jordan one.
NEUT18|So before this whole trend came about to buy grade school Jordan Wines and they started becoming like the wave.
NEUT19|Most of these Jordan ones, the grade school pairs they hovered at around 190, even less like they weren't starting out at 250 to 300 to give you an example of city.
NEUT20|And once those in grade school were basically going for 190 to 200 for months like.
NEUT21|Awhile shattered backboard 3.0 same exact thing.
NEUT22|It's almost like a bubble in a way like I'm just seeing Jordan ones are just starting out way too high.
NEUT23|Maybe it's just people trying to invest into them as early as they can.
NEUT24|Maybe it's people actually buying them to wear, but what I really think is happening is people are just blindly investing into them without understanding that the people who are going to buy these once they go up or the people who are going to wear them, they're not going to hold them even longer.
NEUT25|So looking at the shoe obviously I personally don't like the shoe.
NEUT26|I feel like girls might like it, but that's primarily the gender who's going to be wearing them.
NEUT27|Maybe some men might wear them, but it's just not a good looking shoe, and so that's why I'd stress so much.
NEUT28|Just wait a little bit.
NEUT29|I think they're going to go down to about 220 for the grade school, and once they go to about 220 you can buy in.
NEUT30|And I think that these are going to go up to like 350 to 400, but I don't think that these are going to skyrocket as quick as people might think they will.
NEUT31|I think these are going to take some time.
NEUT32|I personally have been offered lots of both pairs.
NEUT33|I passed on all of them.
NEUT34|They were asking 240 like 250.
NEUT35|I said no to every single one of them because if people are offering me this many pairs for that price, I might as well just wait a little bit longer.
NEUT36|They won't be able to sell it and then get it for like 220 to like 200.
NEUT37|So that's my take on it.
NEUT38|Of course I could be wrong.
NEUT39|I'm not always right by in whenever you feel it's right, but this is what I'm going to do.
NEUT40|I'm going to wait, you know, you can buy it now and then.
NEUT41|Wait until I go to like three?
