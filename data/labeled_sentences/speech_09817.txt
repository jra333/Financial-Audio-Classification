BULL0|"""Buddy, thanks for watching this quick video on General Electric stock."
NEUT1|We are in the US marketplace in front of us.
NEUT2|There is one hour candle stick showing the price movement of this stock.
BEAR3|As we can see, since April prices has been moving inside the channel between 5.5 and eight U.S. dollar.
NEUT4|This is without my technical analysis interpretation.
NEUT5|This is with my analysis, interpretation and.
NEUT6|Generally when prices are moving inside the channel, the idea is to easy idea.
NEUT7|The idea is just just using simple tools like the stochastic or.
NEUT8|It is the stochastic or or just the channel table where the prices are closer to the bottom side to the bottom with with stochastic in over sold the DS2 goal.
NEUT9|Wait vice versa when prices are closer to the top channel line and the prices are in overboard, that is to go short.
NEUT10|This is what happened there.
NEUT11|What happened their boat up in here and now we are too late to get into this talk because we should have gone longer or in beginning of October.
NEUT12|Now this talk seems this talk.
BULL13|Yeah, seems that it's going up.
NEUT14|Probably up to a target price of eight U.S. dollars.
NEUT15|So the next step for now, it's just all the next step is.
NEUT16|If these are the target price will be brief.
BEAR17|This eight U.S. dollar will be broken as residents level.
NEUT18|The idea is that this past may go up to 10 U.S. dollar is target price.
NEUT19|Otherwise if this one will not be broken, the idea is to go shorter and assuming that this price will keep moving inside this channel between 6 U.S. dollar and eight U.S. dollar.
NEUT20|So as we are right now, just hold after that there are two options.
NEUT21|Option one if this target price will be broken.
NEUT22|The idea is to go along with the next target price of 10 U.S. dollar or otherwise.
NEUT23|If this this as residents level will not be broken the next day, said he has to go short, assuming that the price is the stock will keep moving inside this channel with the target price of 6 U.S. dollar.
NEUT24|That's all from my side.
NEUT25|"Thanks bye."""
