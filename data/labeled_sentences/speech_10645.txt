NEUT3|Because my late mother the wheeze Kramer, gave me some great advice many many years ago.
NEUT4|See Mom loved the stock market, but more than that she loved gambling.
NEUT5|She loved the ponies.
NEUT6|Typically the maiden claiming races and Liberty Raceway love the daily double.

NEUT8|Now more of a black guy, but Mom she couldn't go buy a one armed bandit.
BEAR9|Valleys are throwing away some money.
NEUT10|Funny thing though, she.
NEUT11|There's a slank city.
NEUT12|Funny thing she always had good luck at this total game of chance.
NEUT13|I'm not talking about Aroa cherries here, I'm talking about Peaches, plums, even 3 bars.
NEUT14|One time not long before she passed 35 years ago, we went fishing off your favorite Paramore Gate.
NEUT15|Right next to the old motel motel and then headed Uptown to resorts that want to play that night she was an unstoppable force.
BEAR16|That day, she pulled and pulled and I swear, the worst.
NEUT17|She called us three lemons.
NEUT18|There was a pilot coin, so high is where we get Rob.
NEUT19|Didn't matter though.

NEUT32|She tells me.
NEUT33|We're outta here.

NEUT36|She said, let others make some money.
NEUT37|And then she sashayed over to the cashier window, swap the coins for Benjamin couple other presidents.
NEUT38|Then we went to the store, bought that darn cashmere sweater.
NEUT39|And the lesson has stuck with me for nearly 40 years.
NEUT40|Sometimes you gotta quit a little while your head.
NEUT41|Now, right now we got to Smokin hot, a stock market I have ever seen.
