NEUT1|Hello guys, today we're going to talk about Tesla Tesla.
NEUT2|I had I wanna say study study.
NEUT3|Gaines but let's let's begin test.
NEUT4|I had a volume today about 39 million and a high of 69699 and a low of 668.
NEUT5|So Tesla, I don't know.
BEAR6|It definitely dropped from Friday 690 to 660.
NEUT7|667 so I don't know how Tesla's gonna be doing well for a while, but in my opinion.
NEUT8|I think Tesla might be going.
BEAR9|Down a little bit, in my opinion it might start selling off.
NEUT10|'cause there's some indication as you can see, like right there.
NEUT11|It might start selling off so.
NEUT12|Yeah, my opinion I think.
NEUT13|I'm going to wait till Tesla starts touching around.
NEUT14|500 again, and I'll probably start buying again, but at the moment I think just let's just kind of giving out some of its gains.
NEUT15|So yeah.
NEUT16|But Tesla Cramer has been hyping Tesla Price.
NEUT17|To $3000.
NEUT18|So Kramer has been hyping it to $3000 except for Kathy Woods, so.
NEUT19|We're gonna see how this thing is going to be, but.
