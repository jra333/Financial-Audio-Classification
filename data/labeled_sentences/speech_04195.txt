NEUT0|"""Welcome back, well, The Force Awakens in this case Disney."
NEUT1|Today, we're going to talk about the shareholder, the owner of the Star Wars franchise, which is Disney.
NEUT2|We traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
NEUT3|'s biggest success in the world of stocks and bonds, but certainly in stocks as Star Wars is at your local theater.
NEUT4|Now I'm not the expert in Star Wars, I don't know all the characters.
NEUT5|I don't know all the 6-7 movies that have been produced in the series, but let's take a look at the stock and see if it's one that you want to own.
NEUT6|The stock has been.
NEUT7|As you can see here, nothing but a success trading at 1020 thirty dollars.
NEUT8|And now I think was 16 at the crash.
NEUT9|Now $107.00.
NEUT10|It's expensive 22 times earnings and the question is, is now the time to jump in during the boom?
NEUT11|That is the latest Star Wars movie.
BEAR12|I have some questions and reservations about Disney, not because I don't think it's been a well managed company.
NEUT13|Has they have the theme parks, Paris the US are opening something in China.
NEUT14|They have networks ABC.
NEUT15|They have ESPN, the sports channel.
NEUT16|The problem I have with Disney isn't that Luke Skywalker and his ilk are worth money.
NEUT17|They are Mickey Mouse.
NEUT18|But the problem is how much do you want to pay to own a share of a fictional character?
NEUT19|I like hard assets.
BEAR20|I don't like ethereal assets, and one of the problems with Disney is so much of their revenue comes from people willing to spend hundred $200 for the cable franchise.
NEUT21|That's what it is.
NEUT22|A sports channel in the US on cable costs a lot of money.
NEUT23|I think that in the future that people, yeah they may go to those theme parks.
BULL24|That's not going to bring the stock of Disney to 214 or double what it is today, so it's a very rich proposition.
NEUT25|4 times book.
NEUT26|It's a big number.
NEUT27|What is book?
NEUT28|There's some hard assets in the themes, but otherwise these are franchises.
BULL29|These networks they've been very successful with some of their tie ends and probably geniuses at it.
NEUT30|And if you said to me wait a minute, Matthew, I can make money with Disney.
NEUT31|I say go ahead because the earnings momentum in this company is there, but the question is, are you throwing good money at a very high multiple?
NEUT32|And that's my that's my concern.
NEUT33|I'm not concerned that there they don't know what they're doing.
NEUT34|I'm concerned that there's not a lot of upside here.
NEUT35|That we've had the upside in the last 5-10 years, so the force may awaken you and you may say why am I not in Disney?
NEUT36|Enjoy the film.
NEUT37|Maybe keep your money, your investment money outside the theater.
NEUT38|It's all the time we have today on the investment advisor.
NEUT39|I'm your host Matthew Stevenson, in partnership with Dukascopy TV.
NEUT40|Remember, money can take care of you.
NEUT41|"It cannot take care of itself."""
