NEUT0|"""Well, I think that we're seeing once again, maybe the difference between you know what are great companies?"
BULL1|And water well valued stocks and we can have these gaps in both directions.
NEUT2|You know it's not really about the economic data because we've got that solid payroll report on Friday.
NEUT3|But remember, it's the same stock market where the Dow soared 435 points on the same day that we printed down, 20 million on payrolls.
NEUT4|When that April data rolled out in early May, and the question back then was well, why would the stock market start to rally like that?
BEAR5|With the economic data so bad?
BEAR6|And it's because the stock market got so egregiously undervalued at that point in time.
NEUT7|So we really re round the movie were on the other side right now where we went into this, you know?
BULL8|Last Wednesday the NASDAQ was 30% over its 200 day moving average.
BULL9|The SMP of 100 was 15% gapping above its 200 day moving average.
BEAR10|These are extreme.
BEAR11|I would say parabolic moves in the spot indices against their fundamental trend lines.
NEUT12|So the bottom line here you know is that the old saying.
NEUT13|You know the higher they are, the harder they fall.
BEAR14|The valuations are just at extremes and there's a long way to go down before we even find these firm support levels.
NEUT15|So my advice would be either you know, it's hard to tell people to lighten up on equities when they made such huge gains and concerned about taxes, but I find different ways to find defensive sectors or sectors that are inversely correlated with the stock market.
NEUT16|Or maybe use?
NEUT17|You know volatility or options market wakes up trying to hedge against what is clearly a tremendous amount of volatility.
BEAR18|"But the downward pressure is probably not going to relent anytime soon."""
