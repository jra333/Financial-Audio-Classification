NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews for another segment of ask a fool today we're taking a question from Michelle and Michelle asks, I believe most right believe marijuana will be legal in most states."
NEUT1|Soon is The Motley Fool looking at any stocks in this industry, and you know Brendan, this is a question we have seen.
NEUT2|I mean alot alot alot of questions about this recently because of you know what's going on in Washington state in Colorado and I know that Washington DC is another example.
NEUT3|I think there really.
NEUT4|Minimizing sort of the laws there as well.
NEUT5|It's kind of a little bit of a balancing act there, but what's your take on this right now?
NEUT6|So to answer the question, the short answer is no, we're not looking at any marijuana stocks, and the reason is simple.
NEUT7|There are no large publicly traded companies that are going to directly benefit from the legalization of marijuana right now.
NEUT8|Now, in the future, if there are companies, we might look at him.
NEUT9|What there are right now are a lot of penny stocks that are being promoted.
NEUT10|That our people are sort of getting into the story and the hype, and we typically advise people not to invest in penny stocks.
BULL11|Yeah, I think that's an excellent point.
NEUT12|I mean, we, you know we're always looking for some kind of a short term event or a long term trend that's going along with our investment thesis.
BULL13|And while this looks like it could shape up to be a long term trend.
NEUT14|This is in the very early innings in everything we see out there, it seems to be penny stock related.
NEUT15|There's nothing really any substance behind this yet, and I think you made a good point there yet.
NEUT16|I mean, there may be something that comes of this.
NEUT17|But yeah, right now I think my take is basically the same.
NEUT18|I just haven't seen anything out there that seemed close to compelling to support any kind of investment.
NEUT19|And here's the thing.
NEUT20|If one of these stocks does sort of these penny stocks that are hyped up actually does turn out to be successful, it becomes a larger business.
BULL21|You can still get in then and still have the opportunity to grow so.
NEUT22|I would say I'm avoiding all these marijuana related penny stocks.
NEUT23|All right.
NEUT24|Good stuff.
BULL25|Thanks a lot Brendan.
