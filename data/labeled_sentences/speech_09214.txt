NEUT0|"""Let's talk about the structure of this pack, because one of the things that's unique about it is the pipe."
NEUT1|These are the investors who are getting in right now, including some investors who had been involved before who are rolling in.
NEUT2|And it sounds like putting more money in that includes the Barry Diller's of the world of the David Zasloff's of the World, Rob Pittman.
NEUT3|We mentioned his name earlier, but interesting Lee, at least to me, was seeing Chamath Polly Hoppity a involved in this, because typically he acts is the quote unquote sponsor of Big Stacks.
NEUT4|In this case, he's an investor in this.
NEUT5|How did that happen?
NEUT6|Well, I think it's I've had a long relationship with his partner in Osborne and I think that had us via is an incredible company and I think what what is really interesting here is historically chamath and Ian had been investing inspects alright, and there's been questions, you know, by you and others about you know, are they only investing this book for the promote?
NEUT7|And that's just not the case.
NEUT8|You know they're looking at a lot of companies and they're investing at a $10 level.
NEUT9|Frankly, without warrants.
NEUT10|Locked up to the end of the deal because they believe in Blade and I can't tell you how humbled I am by the people that participate in this pipe.
NEUT11|This pipe was originally $100 million.
BEAR12|It was two times oversubscribed.
NEUT13|We're going to we're fully committed capital at $125 million.
BULL14|With this, you said some of the best names in the industry, so we're really pleased.
NEUT15|Literally, as you've been on the air here in this just this morning, you're looking at this about 17% up right now.
NEUT16|You know we keep talking about IPO is whether companies are actually getting the right value.
NEUT17|Do you look at that?
NEUT18|I you have money in this continuing, of course.
BULL19|So this is a good thing for you.
NEUT20|But how do you look at the process and a lot of people talk about whether the IPO process is broken and then people even talk about sometimes some of these valuations on specs.
NEUT21|I wanna say a broken, but there's sometimes some misalignments.
NEUT22|Well, I think what's interesting here is that if you look at our partner KSL, they have always been in aviation, an in fact they own 17 FBO's, which are terminals and airports which will allow us in the future and hopefully the near future to have staging areas for Avital allow allow them to have lower repositioning costs, charging areas in important cities.
NEUT23|You know places like West Chester in Palm Springs and Sarasota, FL.
NEUT24|So picking the right partner.
NEUT25|Was very important and it's also important to note that you know as much as we all talk about.
NEUT26|These promotes the valuations, reflect that.
NEUT27|So in other words, when investors evaluating ASPAC that is pro forma vernie any promote that may come into play, I think what's important from an issuer and from a company or an entrepreneur or new company is really the ability to sell to investors that potential the company has.
NEUT28|A company that some it's a transformation.
NEUT29|And right now there truly is, you know, an incredible transformation in terms of mobility on the ground and it's going into the air.
NEUT30|And you had yesterday.
NEUT31|I believe, you know your TPG on the phone with culture.
NEUT32|I know he.
NEUT33|He invested, created a company for electric charging in Europe and he said, you know, I'm not sure which of these car companies are going to be the winner, but I know they're all going to be charged.
NEUT34|Blade is really an index play an E vite, all billions of imported by manufacturers like.
NEUT35|Our investor, Airbus, Boeing and other companies.
NEUT36|We don't know who's going to win, but we know there's going to be a service layer.
NEUT37|We know they're going to need terminals.
NEUT38|We know they're going to need booking.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
