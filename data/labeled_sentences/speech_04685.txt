NEUT0|"""Hey, good evening or good afternoon."
NEUT1|Good morning, hello, whenever you're watching this high elbow bump, OK?
NEUT2|I want to look at Biogen here.
BULL3|We've had a pretty good week on for stock market mentor.
NEUT4|As far as our growth stock list goes, but I want to talk about a biotech stock here by agenda and This is why.
NEUT5|Here's what I don't like about this pattern.
NEUT6|It's really heavy.
BEAR7|This is a big steep sell off.
NEUT8|You know it could this this looks like the aftermath of an Adam Feuerstein article that got debunked.
BEAR9|The stock sold off really really nasty like it has before, but it is at this point now where the stock is.
NEUT10|At established support like 290 bucks, that is just you know less than 4% below where the stock is trading right now.
NEUT11|So I think an earnings aren't an issue.
NEUT12|I think your trade here on this this I'll make this really easy Members.
NEUT13|The video is about 45 minutes long and I'm talking about entries.
NEUT14|But anyway this is a short 10.
NEUT15|I'd buy the stock here.
NEUT16|An I would set my stop right there right underneath the 200 day moving average.
NEUT17|These are the kinds of opportunities that you want to take advantage of.
NEUT18|And here's the thing.
NEUT19|This is really important.
NEUT20|You're not buying this stock because you think the stock's going to do that.
NEUT21|It might, we hope so, right?
NEUT22|No, you're buying the stock because it's a low risk entry because you know that if the stock falls below the 200 day moving average, then your reason for buying it, which is I think, the 200 day moving average after three days of tests.
NEUT23|I think the 200 day moving average is going to hold, so I'm buying that stock.
NEUT24|That's why you're buying the stock.
BEAR25|If the stock falls below the 200 day moving average, it's not going to cost you that much money 'cause you're buying so close.
NEUT26|So your reason for buying the stock is not because I think I'm going to make a gang of money instead, it's because I think the stocks gonna bounce.
NEUT27|It looks like a really good bounce pattern and I don't have to risk much money in order to put myself in a position to make money.
NEUT28|So that's the deal.
NEUT29|It's a huge difference in why you're buying a stock.
NEUT30|And how you're buying a stock?
NEUT31|You're not buying a stock to make a bunch of money.
NEUT32|You're buying a stock to not lose a lot of money if you're wrong.
NEUT33|If you can be thinking about it in those terms, the profits will take care of themselves.
NEUT34|OK, alright, that's it here.
NEUT35|"Members over to the session."""
