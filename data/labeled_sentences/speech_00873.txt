NEUT0|"""Hi friends, welcome to Concepts explained simply."
NEUT1|Today we will understand the concept of trade lifecycle and will understand the same from the perspective of execution of a transaction in stock market.
NEUT2|First of all, we should know about the participants in lifecycle of a trade.
NEUT3|The first one is obviously the seller, that is, the person who wants to sell his shares.
NEUT4|The second participant is the buyer who wants to buy the same shares.
NEUT5|Third one is the broker who facilitates the trading between a buyer and a seller.
NEUT6|There can be two different brokers for both buyer and seller.
NEUT7|4th one is the Stock Exchange or stock market where execution of trade happens.
NEUT8|Both buyer and seller broker need to be member of that particular Stock Exchange.
NEUT9|5th Participant is the depositary.
NEUT10|We're both buyer and seller hold limit accounts.
NEUT11|Demat accounts are the one where shareholders hold their shares in dematerialised form.
NEUT12|It is similar to our bank accounts where we hold our cash in the form of currency.
NEUT13|Depositories were earlier known as custodians when shares were held in the physical form.
NEUT14|Last but not the least, six participant is the clearinghouse that makes sure every trade that is executed in Stock Exchange is settled.
NEUT15|Therefore, it is said that clearinghouse acts as a buyer for each seller and seller for each buyer.
NEUT16|Now let's understand the stages in trade lifecycle.
NEUT17|There are actually three stages, namely execution, clearing and settlement execution is when agreement on trade happens between buyer and seller.
NEUT18|During clearing accounting, an arrangement for transfer of shares and cash between buyer and seller is performed.
NEUT19|Settlement is the final stage when the actual exchange happens.
NEUT20|There are pre standardized settlement cycle in stock exchanges of different countries like T + 2 in India.
BEAR21|In US the settlement cycle was T + 3 which is brought down to T + 2 from September 5th 2017 onwards.
NEUT22|Now let's have a look at complete trade lifecycle, as explained in earlier slides.
NEUT23|Here we can see all the participants that take part in trade lifecycle.
NEUT24|Now let's understand the flow.
NEUT25|Initially, the seller instructs his trader to sell a particular script at a particular price that maybe the current market price or an offer code.
NEUT26|The trader enters that offer in Stock Exchange at the same time, the buyer instruct his trader to buy that particular script at Matic Market Price or a bit code.
NEUT27|The buyers broker also enters the quote in Stock Exchange.
NEUT28|If the offer and bid price for a particular share matches, the trade gets executed in Stock Exchange and the trade execution stage is completed.
NEUT29|Therefore, we can say that trade is set to be executed between buyer and seller.
NEUT30|When agreement on price and quantity is established.
NEUT31|Post execution, the clearing process is triggered where both buyer and seller brokers as an agent of clearinghouse make arrangements for transfer of shares and cash between trading parties.
NEUT32|And once the actual transfer of cash and shares is completed, the trade is set to be settled.
NEUT33|So this was the explanation of complete trade lifecycle.
NEUT34|With this I end my video.
