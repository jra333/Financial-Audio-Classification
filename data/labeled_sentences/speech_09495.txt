NEUT0|"""One name I saw you talking about a recently which is well controversial, maybe even now is hurts and you know, the SEC weighed in what?"
NEUT1|What's the story there?
NEUT2|And do you see value in that particular business?
NEUT3|Well, there's a lot of value in hurts, especially on the secured debt, and the reason is that whole collateral is all the cars.
NEUT4|So the cars are new or their one year old, so there's a tremendous amount of value and hurts the problem for Hertz and the reason they filed is they actually needed liquidity so you know to end up having they had a certain amount of cash, and then they need a debtor in possession financing.
BULL5|The reason the SEC came in is because the value of that stock had moved up, so it was actually better for hurts as opposed to borrowing money.
NEUT6|To end up issuing shares.
NEUT7|Yeah, the problem with that is, intellectually, that makes a lot of sense, but when you've got the unsecured debt of hurt, is trading at 25 thirty cents.
NEUT8|That would imply to you that the value of the equity is worth 0, yet there was all this equity value and I think the SEC stepped in saying that look, we're trying to make sure that people understand that there's a lot of risk to this equity.
NEUT9|You know, and that unsecured debt, which was a 35, is now trading around $0.25, so the secured debt is going to be fine.
NEUT10|It's really going to be the unsecured and for that to have value, Hertz has got to start operating again where people are coming in and renting cars.
BEAR11|The problem is very few people are going away on vacation and are renting cars or are traveling and are renting cars on the business side.
NEUT12|So I think it's going to take a little bit longer.
NEUT13|You talked a little bit about this cycle and I want you to drill down maybe a little bit more.
NEUT14|You and I are about the same age.
NEUT15|We've seen a bunch of these.
NEUT16|How does this rank or rate compared to other cycles that you've worked through?
NEUT17|Sure.
NEUT18|Magic today.
NEUT19|I know you're not supposed to say this, but it's like a once in a lifetime opportunity.
NEUT20|You really.
NEUT21|It's a once in a lifetime, but it happened 10 years ago also.
NEUT22|So but I, I would say you're not gonna see this again.
NEUT23|Where you've actually got an economy, that's fine.
NEUT24|And you've got a Fed pumping trillions of dollars in.
NEUT25|Where really the issue is?
NEUT26|How long does it take for things to turn?
BULL27|"So I think for us you've got an opportunity to invest at a senior level and do extremely well, so you'll either get paid out or you're going to end up owning the equity of this company."""
