BULL0|"""And Tech having a banner year NASDAQ surged 43% its best year since 2009."
NEUT1|With more on how to position yourself for 2021, Savita Subterranean joins, us head of U.S. equity in quantitative strategy at Bank of America Securities, Savita.
BULL2|Great to see you as always.
BULL3|Thanks for for joining us.
BULL4|Clearly phenomenal market performances here, particularly for the tech stocks.
NEUT5|So does tech lead again next year?
BULL6|Heart attack can do really well next year, but I think the leadership that we saw this year is not likely to replicate.
NEUT7|And the reason I say this is that if you look at positioning, if you look at valuations, if you just look at the sort of crowded elements for these technology leaders, you know there's not that much more buying pressure.
NEUT8|You know the world is already long tech, and I think there are other parts of the market that actually look incrementally interesting as we move towards a more you know, kind of a reopening economy so.
NEUT9|Our view is that maybe you buy, you continue to buy GDP sensitive text.
NEUT10|So companies that benefit from unit volume sales growth and this could include some semiconductors, but the story for secular growth tech I think takes a backseat to some of these more cyclical areas of the market that haven't really seen daylight for a long time, so that's where we would be repositioned our portfolios.
BULL11|And for those cyclical sectors, return is going to be driven by multiple expansion or by EPS growth.
NEUT12|But I think next year is going to be a year where earnings is the big story.
NEUT13|In fact, I think we could see a little bit of multiple compression for the overall market because you know, I think what the market did this year kind of makes sense.
BULL14|It it basically anticipated a really strong 20% plus earnings recovery in 2021, which is great.
NEUT15|But you know, as the market discounts this, there's less.
BULL16|There's less upside from a multiple perspective, and in my view, you're really going to see earnings.
BULL17|Kick in over the next 12 months, so I think next year is going to be better for SMP earnings than multiples.
BULL18|I think next year is going to be better for the economy.
NEUT19|Then, for the stock market and I think next year is a year where you really want to kind of do the opposite of a lot of the themes that worked this year, so let's talk about energy in particular.
NEUT20|A few things could have worked for energy, which is the weaker U.S. dollar.
BULL21|The return in global demand, especially out of China.
BEAR22|And yet this is a sector that's still down.
NEUT23|What 40% so far this year?
NEUT24|Something?
NEUT25|It's just secularly challenged by forces like green energy.
NEUT26|And that's certainly where the Biden administration is looking anyway.
NEUT27|Absolutely.
NEUT28|So Sarah.
NEUT29|I think that's a great point, but my take on that is that the damage is already done for energy.
BEAR30|So I think what was interesting is that this year, despite the fact that we had a friendlier administration for energy companies, as you pointed out, they did miserably and these companies did poorly because you had two things going on.
NEUT31|You had a recession as well as these.
NEUT32|This ESG momentum, where you have ESG investors buying, selling, purging energy from their portfolios.
BEAR33|So my sense is we're at a point now where the average fund is almost 50% underweight energy.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
