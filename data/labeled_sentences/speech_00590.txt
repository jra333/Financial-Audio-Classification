NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Blaine at cfbtraders.com and I'm looking at stocks on watch for Tuesday, May 28."
NEUT1|First half here is BLDP nice break out on Friday, over 125 ish.
BULL2|I think this can push higher if it gets through 140 and the big level 144 there which.
NEUT3|Was the middle of the month high from back in March?
NEUT4|Think it could push towards that high for March, which is like one 55156 area and then if that breaks who knows.
BULL5|Might be in for a pretty strong run out of this thing.
BEAR6|It's definitely gonna run if you look at that that push in March off the.
NEUT7|There was some news story, something back in March on that thing.
BEAR8|It's definitely not around to keep you around the LDP BLDP for continuation breakout.
NEUT9|OSH an interesting chart for me to watch the GIF can breakthrough the two mark this week.
BULL10|We might be ready for a push higher.
NEUT11|Definitely some volume, though it's relatively light volume stock, but if it gets volume and combusted at two level I think it.
BULL12|Made a nice trade for it.
NEUT13|Kind of like what oh TT did on this past week.
NEUT14|CALX looking for the continuation.
BULL15|Move through 975, which was the high from earlier in the month.
BULL16|I think if we can get through that after that big bar on Friday then it should be ready for continuation towards 10.
NEUT17|BPA X This has been known and run in the past, so it's worth watching again.
NEUT18|Kind of broke through this bottom.
NEUT19|Consolidation there through that 120 mark on Friday that leads to that.
NEUT20|125 now for continuation, but.
NEUT21|Mini is another big volume bar.
NEUT22|Thinking if get get that volume that buying volume then.
NEUT23|And I think it probably pushes higher, but.
NEUT24|Stephanie, not my favorite one to play in the world.
NEUT25|'cause when it goes it just usually leaves me behind or.
NEUT26|I just end up missing this one so it's on watch though.
NEUT27|Just in case I happen to grab it at the right time.
NEUT28|We'll see how this one plays out.
NEUT29|I'll discuss it more in the trading room if it if it's there for me.
NEUT30|UN XL I kind of like this chart for a bounce play here.
BULL31|It found support around 22.
BULL32|Now it's looking to bounce back through the 24 mark.
NEUT33|Probably could bounce a couple of dollars, I think if it goes.
BEAR34|STSI huge downtrend from for the past six months 3:40 to 1:40 so but I like this thing.
BULL35|Is it made a couple higher lows finally an if it can get through 150 again, I wouldn't be surprised to see this thing Pop so.
NEUT36|Keep your eye on STSI.
NEUT37|Acls needs fall through through 160.
NEUT38|I wouldn't be surprised to see this thing actually speed up and get a nice big pop out of it.
NEUT39|One of these days, Twords 2.
BULL40|There's no guarantee, but definitely like this chart to go higher.
BULL41|And finally, HTCH looks due for another push higher after that break out over three 5325 or 350, which we discussed in the in the chat room earlier in the month.
NEUT42|It finally kind of made a little bit of consolidation, had a sell off and then.
BULL43|It held up pretty well there, so now if we can breakthrough those highs then probably has back Tord 6 or and possibly well over.
NEUT44|So keep HTCH on your watch list as well.
NEUT45|Those are my top watch is for Tuesday may the 28th.
NEUT46|Let me know if you guys have any questions.
NEUT47|"I'll see you in the training room."""
