NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video I will be talking about Tencent Music Entertainment ticker symbol T ME and I'm gonna give you guys some key levels analysts on the stock as well as the levels I gave you.
NEUT4|Guys are working perfectly so it needs to break out of this range right?
NEUT5|To get more clear price action.
NEUT6|OK so I'll explain that makes you guys smash that like button thrown propagations.
NEUT7|And subscribe subscribe subscribe so.
NEUT8|So first level is at $22.21.
NEUT9|This is a resistance level.
NEUT10|OK, so you want to be watching that level closely as price comes up there, it will act as a resistance.
NEUT11|As you can tell, look at this highlight.
NEUT12|The high will come up here.
NEUT13|The high was 2201.
NEUT14|The little gate with 2221 you see how it didn't get up there, right?
NEUT15|So it's pushing price down right then?
NEUT16|Where did price go to when it went down?
NEUT17|It just didn't go anywhere.
NEUT18|It came to this lower that I gave you guys right stop right here.
NEUT19|It started going back up right.
NEUT20|Where to go up to?
NEUT21|Resistance.
BEAR22|Came back down, it closed around 2134 and it is this only down a little bit like $0.10 so not really moving too much aftermarket.
NEUT23|But for right now you want to watch these two levels OK, whichever level breaks out of.
NEUT24|So if this starts breaking out below here.
NEUT25|Then that would be shorter term bullish for me.
BEAR26|An price could drop below $16.00.
BEAR27|OK, that is very low, but if it does drop below $60.00, I do see a good buying area between 15 to 16.
NEUT28|OK, but I won't put that just yet.
NEUT29|This needs to break first.
NEUT30|OK, so this is sort of like a last defense slash Vine level at 19.5.
NEUT31|OK, this was a Vine level, but this wasn't enough.
NEUT32|Buying pressure for me.
BEAR33|OK, this was pressure, but it wasn't enough for me to get in, right?
NEUT34|'cause at the end of the day it didn't do anything at the end of the day, right?
NEUT35|And I didn't want to hold this one overnight to the next day, 'cause it really didn't do anything the next day either.
NEUT36|How much it does move?
NEUT37|So moved by 6% and you guys know my minimum is 10%, so I read it right.
NEUT38|It wasn't buying pressure for me, I just didn't play it.
NEUT39|So right now I'm waiting for it to break out either side.
NEUT40|It needs to break up here to be bullish or break down here and be bearish.
NEUT41|OK, so just watch these two levels again.
BEAR42|Resistance 2221 buying level slash support slash.
BULL43|Last defense is 19.5 OK and once it breaks out of here then we can get our buying level and have a better opportunity to enter in.
NEUT44|That entering in this when you just be holding without the stock doing anything.
NEUT45|OK, so if you guys like this video, this was a update.
NEUT46|I dare you guys, your guys messages and remember it now.
NEUT47|This recommendation, advice or anything.
NEUT48|This educational purposes only.
NEUT49|So John trade anything you see or hear these videos and I catch you guys in the next one.
NEUT50|"Bye."""
