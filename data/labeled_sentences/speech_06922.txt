NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, its David Keno at base camp trading and this is the free video for Friday September 18th."
NEUT1|Again, we're watching Amazon here and I've been watching it for past couple of days watching it last earlier in the week when we were looking for that breakdown.
NEUT2|You can see it.
NEUT3|Here is the gap yesterday and today.
BEAR4|This is a bit of a bearish, engulfing pattern, so we're clearly in this well established drop.
NEUT5|I remember Amazon didn't break higher with the market when it bounced, it just consolidated, and here's the follow through the next steps that Amazon may breakthrough Lex next level support.
NEUT6|Again, we're right now breaking 2918.
NEUT7|The next level supports 2900 below that 2888.
BEAR8|If we don't break those levels today, I'm looking for follow through into next week, and definitely I think Amazon can close below 2972 today.
BEAR9|I mean, that's a sizable move, lower down 93 points.
BULL10|"So again watching for continuation and sell off in Amazon going into next week."""
