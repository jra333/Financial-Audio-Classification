NEUT0|"""Hey, it's quite in this video chart ticker symbol ACB."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|So if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Well, very disappointing day, but looking at more than one day the bigger picture chart it's hanging in there it's it's walk around in the edge, which I'll talk about here in a second, but the overall chart is hanging in there but looking at today.
BULL5|A disappointing day an I realized, you know, I'm probably repeating what you already realized, but that first 30 minutes volume came pouring in very, very nice.
NEUT6|Move to the upside and then from there it just rolled right back over and just bled and bled and bled the remainder of the day, which brought it all the way down to where it closed at that green line.
NEUT7|And I realize this will be a little bit more of those that have watched the other videos I've done.
NEUT8|On this one, but right here at this green line, at $2.00, the price closed right there and now the big dynamic going into next week is, you know, is this price headed right back to where it was?
NEUT9|What do I mean by that?
NEUT10|Will let me actually squeeze down the charter to?
NEUT11|Bring up a little bit more context, but down in this area of the chart is where there is a whole lot of track record.
NEUT12|I mean, the price has been down inside of this range of the chart several days now, but then you have to give credit where credits do one a few days ago the price made the great move upwards broke to the upside of that, you know, will call it channel and then after that just came up.
NEUT13|Let me try that again.
NEUT14|Grab an arrow.
NEUT15|There we go and came roaring to life.
NEUT16|And of course things have rolled back over.
NEUT17|But at this point time what is still in play.
NEUT18|And I realize, yeah, nobody you know this is nobody wants to see the price fall away back there but what is still in play is you could still have a set of those here and you have these lows down there.
NEUT19|And if you envision these stairsteps hey, well, at least from the bigger picture, these stair steps are still progressing in the upward direction, whereas if the price and this $2.00 mark does not hold and the price just continues on down when all of a sudden, what do you have?
NEUT20|You quite literally have the price right back inside of this range where it already was and not once or intelligence, but price movements with genuine power.
NEUT21|Don't go back to where they were, so that is why $2.00.
NEUT22|Very very important level going forward and why it's such an interesting scenario here because the price is literally sitting right at that area.
NEUT23|So let's see if the price can hold up above $2.00 or not.
NEUT24|Next week.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT34|And I'll show you.
NEUT35|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live.
NEUT37|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
