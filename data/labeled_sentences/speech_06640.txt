NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Tuesday, November 21st, 2017."
NEUT1|I'm referred by John currencyanalystericsson.com and today we're going to look at the New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|Kiwi dollar is rather bearish at the moment, both in the short term and medium term outlooks.
NEUT3|We can see the stochastics they have flat and out just at the oversold level at 20.
NEUT4|So the downside.
BEAR5|Pressure appears to have ended for the time being, but we are not seeing any upside momentum either, so it could be trading sideways of the coming days.
NEUT6|At the moment we are seeing.
BEAR7|Immediate support resistance.
BEAR8|Immediate resistance coming at the Zero point 6817 level, which was the low from end of October.
BEAR9|Further downside.
NEUT10|We could see prices once again targeting this weeks 17 month low 0.67 eighty and below that we have key levels at around zero point 6717.
NEUT11|That's 161.8% Fibonacci Fibonacci level of the uplink from Zero Point, 6817 to zero point.
NEUT12|6979 and further down we have the 261.8% through bonacci around Zero point 6556.
NEUT13|If we were to see.
BEAR14|An upside reversal would likely to see resistance coming from the 61.8% Fibo Nachi Run Zero Point 6880.
NEUT15|We can see that was a previous congestion area also.
BULL16|There should be a strong support once again coming from around Zero Point 6920 Zero point 694 T those are the 38.2 and 23.6% venci levels, but really we would need to see a break above the.
BULL17|The previous top of Zero Point 6979 to see a sustained upside momentum and a break above the 50 day moving average around Zero Point 7045 at the moment.
NEUT18|To shift the short term bias from the current bearish one to back to bullish.
NEUT19|That's it for me.
BULL20|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
