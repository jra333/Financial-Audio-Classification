NEUT0|"""You were kind of the OG original gangster of this documentary era though, and you know now it's sort of spread out I think to a really great degree because of work you have this arrangement with PBS, but you know HBO's of course gotten in the in the business."
NEUT1|Netflix, what do you make of the world of documentary films right now?
NEUT2|Can you know it?
NEUT3|In 85 we were talking about how what a great Golden age it was, 'cause documentaries of very weak word, because it means, you know.
NEUT4|Uh, what you know?
NEUT5|Michael Moore was doing what you know, somebody's.
NEUT6|There was a film called Streetwise.
NEUT7|It was Errol Morrises thing.
NEUT8|It's it's self initiated, self involved films like Raw Smack, always.
NEUT9|Sherman's March, March, wow.
NEUT10|Yeah, all of these things, my stuff, you know.
BULL11|It was just great.
NEUT12|The whole things were right up to fiction.
NEUT13|Maybe crossing over the line to you know pure documentary like Fred Wiseman stuff.
NEUT14|I mean there was just an amazing spectrum and it's only gotten bigger and more.
NEUT15|Effective and maybe this success of the Civil War had something to do with people turning around and saying the cost per hour of whatever versus fiction.
NEUT16|But look, I've been with public television.
NEUT17|My entire thing I'm staying with them.
NEUT18|They have 1 foot in the marketplace and the other tentatively out look.
NEUT19|I could have gone a few years ago or 10 and a half 1013 years ago to a streaming channel or a or a premium cable and say I need.
NEUT20|With my track record, I need $30 million to do Vietnam and they would have given me.
NEUT21|But what they wouldn't have given me is 10 1/2 years.
NEUT22|PBS gave me 10 1/2 years and they gave me 6 1/2 on Ernest Hemingway and 10 on national parks.
NEUT23|I mean we've got many projects going at once.
NEUT24|I've got eight others happening now with four different teams and I'm not missing stuff.
NEUT25|I'm delegating in a way 'cause I don't have to do everything the way I did when I started off.
NEUT26|With you know in knee pants in this but interesting model is that it's not a financial model.
NEUT27|It's a grant model.
NEUT28|We raise money from foundations and individuals of wealth from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, from PBS itself.
NEUT29|Bank of America has been our corporate sponsor since 2006.
BULL30|They've signed up to 2030.
NEUT31|We've had a kind of stable of support from foundations like the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Pew Charitable Trust, the Park Foundation, stuff like that we.
NEUT32|Started a group started called the Better Angels Society which is a nonprofit that seeks money from individuals of wealth to help do these films.
NEUT33|And so we make them as zero sum games, not allowed to put in contingency, not allowed to put in any profit margin, and it just happens.
NEUT34|And then when they're done, it's all zeros and we've already moved on to the other projects that we're working on.
NEUT35|What that gives me is total creative control, which is I live in rural New Hampshire.
NEUT36|This is my barn.
NEUT37|Because I do not want to sit here having a conversation with you and saying, well, you know they wouldn't let me do this and they wouldn't let me do that.
NEUT38|I really wanted to work with that writer or I really wanted this person and.
BEAR39|If you don't like this these films, it's all my fault.
BEAR40|"I mean, in this case it's Lynn and My's fault, 'cause she's the Co director, but it's our fault and that's the way you want it to be, no excuses."""
