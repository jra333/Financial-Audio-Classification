NEUT0|"""Charge point 735 million in sales last year management."
BULL1|They can grow at a 50% clip this year, EV boxboard in â‚¬70 million last year, and their forecasting 72% growth this year.
NEUT2|Better than Chargepoint given the TV box is a lot more conservative with the long term projections only giving numbers out to 2023, I'm inclined to take them darn seriously.
BULL3|They also think they'll be breaking even by 2023, at least in terms of earnings for interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and that's a year before Chargepoint police.
NEUT4|They'll get their ego is early in its lifecycle.
NEUT5|They had 14 million in revenues last year.
BULL6|Not that big, but they only see growing 49% this year.
BULL7|But then Eve ego projects fifties 4,000,000 in 2022 and 166 million in 2023, which would represent massive acceleration if their sales take off.
NEUT8|Like that.
BULL9|Wow, management will be both positive in 2023 once again Chargepoint EV box are very similar though.
NEUT10|EV box seems that the edge right now even goes the smaller more speculatory with a faster growth trajectory.
BULL11|Think higher risk, higher reward Tyree Kill versus Saima homes alright?
NEUT12|Final export price.
NEUT13|Remember, they still haven't finished merging with their SPAC part, their backers, but right now Chargepoint has an implied enterprise value of 11.1 billion EV.
BULL14|Box is just under 3 billion, even goes at 4.6 plate, assuming they can hit their 2023 sales forecasts.
NEUT15|Charge points trading more than 18 times.
NEUT16|Sales EV goes at 28 times sales, both very expensive.
NEUT17|Only Vbox ports are reasonable.
NEUT18|Valuation less than 7 * 2023 sales charge point.
BEAR19|Remember trades under SB $38.68.
NEUT20|EV box trades under TPGY $24.00.
NEUT21|Stock EV go trades under CLI $19.00.
NEUT22|Stock bottom line if you want a charging station plate boom EV box seems like the best of the bunch.
BULL23|Very similar chargepoint over the faster growth and cheaper stock.
BULL24|Remember you need to buy this pack TPG beneficial finance and I think you can start building position right here in 24 months.
NEUT25|Something more speculative.
NEUT26|You've got my blessing to pick at EV.
NEUT27|Go on weakness.
NEUT28|That's climate change crisis.
NEUT29|Real impact though.
