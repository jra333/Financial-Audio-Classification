BULL0|"""There's a lively debate going on about whether or not the United States can enter a double dip recession now, with the common thinking is all we're going to have the vaccine and everything is going to be better from the April made."
NEUT1|On as the vaccine moves through the US population and there's no question that there's a lot of truth to that.
NEUT2|But that's April or May.
NEUT3|What do we do between now and the first quarter?

NEUT10|"And that is why there's open debate on this subject."""
