NEUT0|"""What's up YouTube?"
NEUT1|Today I'll be talking about a stock that I just picked up that any growth investors should consider doing research and then potentially buy.
NEUT2|So I'm going to be talking bout company called Crowd Strike just to give you an idea, I first discovered this company in January 8th and I really like this.
NEUT3|I just bought a one share here just to not forget about it and this week I picked up 20 more shares at the $94.00 range.
NEUT4|And let me tell you why.
NEUT5|So if you don't know the crowd strike is a cyber security technology company that is based in California.
NEUT6|What I like about them is first of all they are growing like crazy.
NEUT7|So let me just show you this so it's only a 3 year old company that's been on the public market, but they've been around probably for a little bit longer, but on the public market they've been only three years.
NEUT8|So just look at their revenues.
BEAR9|Yes, they're still not profitable, but this quarter they reported.
NEUT10|First time beat on a chair.
NEUT11|The analysts were estimated $0.06.
NEUT12|Loss for sure, but they actually got $0.02.
BULL13|More earnings per share.
NEUT14|What I like about them is as soon as they reported all the analysts.
NEUT15|Improve the target to buy an another reason.
NEUT16|I think it's a good thing to buy is one of the paid services recommended this?
NEUT17|Stock on June.
NEUT18|I'm not going to tell you which paid service it is, but it's a popular paid service that.
NEUT19|I have access to an.
NEUT20|They recommended it an also another paid service recommended the stock.
NEUT21|I'm not going to tell you which one, but you can kind of.
NEUT22|See who suggested it here.
NEUT23|I'm looking at this information from Twitter, but I'm pretty confident that this is the pic, so one not two biggest investor firms suggesting you to consider buying this stock that is telling you something.
BULL24|So what I think about it, they have plenty of room to growth, but they do have some competition from the scalar which is another cloud computing company.
NEUT25|And of course Microsoft.
NEUT26|But what I like about them is.
NEUT27|That they provide artificial intelligence security.
NEUT28|So the more data that they see, the more accurately they will be able to protect and stop cyber crime.
BULL29|I believe that it's a attractive entry under 100.
NEUT30|Right now it's trading low bit expensive, but I'll still for long term.
NEUT31|If you're here for five years at least, as soon as they're going to be reporting more and more earnings.
BULL32|I believe this is going to be an easy $150 stock in within three years.
NEUT33|So let me know what you think.
NEUT34|This is a quick video already made on this share made.
NEUT35|How to make it up 'cause I don't sell it but you can see that I was interested in this company and.
NEUT36|January 8th, but now I decided to go a little bit more heavy and if it's going to be dropping into nineties 80s, I'll be picking up more shares to average down, so let me know what you think about this company.
NEUT37|Will you be investing now?
NEUT38|Cross Strait yeah let me know let me know in the comments below but it's it's A1 stock that I recommend looking into it.
BULL39|"Alright goodbye you too."""
