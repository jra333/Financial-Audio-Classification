BULL0|"""So OK, plug power's been an exciting stock for a long time."
NEUT1|It's had its ups and its downs.
NEUT2|Is that here and now over Andy?
NEUT3|Given these two acquisitions and the base of clients that want hydrogen fuel cells?
NEUT4|Well Jim, when I take a step back during this recent pandemic, 25% of retail food in the United States moved through Plug Power's products.
NEUT5|In many of the Internet home retail that people have received came through Plug Powers products.
NEUT6|So as you mentioned in your introduction, this is a real company with real business.
BULL7|The acquisitions actually completes it complete total system solution.
NEUT8|We bring customers.
NEUT9|So for Amazon we don't.
NEUT10|The hydrogen stations.
NEUT11|We provide the fuel cells.
NEUT12|We provide the aftermarket service and now we can provide them green hydrogen.
NEUT13|Alright, so let's talk about that you have said and committed in all of your publications that you will new never do anything but green.
NEUT14|That that is just the way of the world for you.
NEUT15|Why is this the cleanest fuel?
NEUT16|No, when you think about green hydrogen, you have to think about the feedstock.
NEUT17|And I think people understand clearly if you take solar you take win.
NEUT18|If you take hydro power and you combine it with plug powers electrolyzer's the outputs, green hydrogen with zero carbon footprint.
NEUT19|And Jim, we've not.
NEUT20|We're not doing this because.
NEUT21|You know we're doing this because our customers told us they want green solutions and this is how we went about solving the problem.
NEUT22|They put in front of us.
NEUT23|Alright, so Elon Musk, who is revered in this country, at least in the stock market, part of the country, famously called Fools, called you that.
NEUT24|This is cool, said that fuel cells.
NEUT25|So why should I believe you over Elon Musk?
NEUT26|I ready line must stand some the course themes in the world Lenny of Rocket in the middle of the ocean.
NEUT27|Building Tesla, but you know.
NEUT28|When you start thinking about why batteries don't work, especially for commercial vehicles, long term especially things like class 3 to class 8 trucks.
NEUT29|Fuel cells are 110th the size and much later.
NEUT30|So no, it is.
NEUT31|DHL told me, do they want to be carrying battery batteries around in their delivery bands or do they want to be delivering packages so?
NEUT32|I listen to DHL people by product, but I gotta tell you I'm hoping one day Mr must buys from Plug Power because we'd be happy to work with him.
