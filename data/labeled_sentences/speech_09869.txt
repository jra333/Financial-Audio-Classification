NEUT0|"""What's up guys, it's your boy will back on the video today."
NEUT1|This video will be about GameStop stock ticker symbol G ME.
NEUT2|So today I'm giving up my Jean GME, stock analysts and my GMP stock predictions, OK?
NEUT3|So miss you guys like the video.
NEUT4|Turn close vacation so you don't miss any updates and also at the subscribe button so.
NEUT5|Before previously, you guys know I had this level at 156.12 that after that pop up that came back down here I was going to buy but I wasn't watching it.
NEUT6|Which ***** 'cause I would have bought right here and then as you guys know it ran back up so that kind of ***** but we have to move on.
NEUT7|But I do think if it's level which it looks like it might, I don't know how strong the support would be.
NEUT8|So this is my new level that I will buy off of 9839.
NEUT9|Again, these levels are very volatile, so just be careful.
BULL10|But as you can tell, this would have been good by area and shot back up.
NEUT11|How much percent is that?
BULL12|Over 100%, which is what I like to get again.
NEUT13|Watch a game stock.
NEUT14|I don't think it is over.
NEUT15|I think they're just trying to scare you guys out of a plane the stuck like on Robin Hood there restricting shares you can only buy like one share.
NEUT16|I think that's why it's going down 'cause that they're not letting anybody buy an just a lot of shady stuff going on.
NEUT17|So and they're trying to push.
NEUT18|What is it silver?
NEUT19|At that, I think that is a fake push to get people out of GameStop and MC and then try to bring them silver.
NEUT20|So sitting down all them can make money and then get people out of the stock so they're shorting these stocks.
BULL21|Just a whole lot of stuff, but I do hopefully game stock stock starts to push up again and hopefully everyone is holding.
NEUT22|I am looking to get an shares for the movement.
NEUT23|Around $100 it looks like it's going to come down there again.
NEUT24|It is down after hours.
BEAR25|It was at 2:25 and I was looking at 187 so it's looking like it might come down to this level again.
NEUT26|I will be watching this level.
BULL27|I don't think it might be a strong, but it still might hold it like it did here.
NEUT28|So I'll be watching this level to see how price reacts at this level and if it starts going up like a movement like this then I'll get in right here at these levels and I'll just hold for a longer term.
NEUT29|Like over $500 a share.
NEUT30|I'll just be holding 'cause I think all this is just a fake down movement like it really didn't go down.
NEUT31|It's just what they want you to see.
NEUT32|So I will be buying shares.
NEUT33|See if I see a good of movement coming.
NEUT34|But if I still see it down and I'll be getting to down here.
NEUT35|But for excess level then I don't see anything until like $45.00 and if it goes down that low then I just won't be playing at all and I'll look for another stock to play.
NEUT36|So make sure you guys are careful in game stocks out.
NEUT37|Have your risk management.
NEUT38|So just in case.
NEUT39|If it does go to zero or where it was back to of $4 or $10, something like that.
NEUT40|Then you guys it won't hurt your portfolio.
NEUT41|OK, I usually do 1% on penny stocks, so I'll be doing like 1% on this stock as well.
NEUT42|Of my total portfolio.
NEUT43|That's why I'm playing game stock buying off these two levels and we will see how it goes, so make sure you guys like the video, not this recommendation bar, so anything, just for educational purposes only.
NEUT44|"So do not try anything to see his videos and I'll catch you guys in next."""
