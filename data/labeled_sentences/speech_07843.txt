BEAR0|"""Do you worry more about a sudden resurgence, surgence of inflation, or do you worry more about all this debt that countries are creating?"
NEUT1|You know you mentioned in section.
NEUT2|Of course, these trade.
BEAR3|The reasons could create inflation and shortages.
NEUT4|Economics in some of the sectors.
NEUT5|That's that's one.
NEUT6|That's one channel.
NEUT7|The other channel is of course the excess debt monetization.
NEUT8|Could that create some monetary inflation in the third channel worried?
NEUT9|Of course, the the wage price loop and the idea that because of unemployment you massively have an increase in wages and inflation.
NEUT10|This risk of sensation when we look at the modeling remembers these three channels of inflation, or actually capped somehow.
NEUT11|By some of the anchoring that is happening through markets but also by some of the measures that policymakers could make.
NEUT12|You know, central banks could decide to cap or two to exceed the success of that manipulation as early as 2020, one 22 you know the wage price Lee.
NEUT13|This is something that policymakers know how to handle.
NEUT14|The trade one we could actually subsidizing part.
NEUT15|So I I'm less worried that of inflation.
BEAR16|I think we could have a temporary overshoot for the eurozone.
NEUT17|It could be, you know, two 2.5% inflation, but some people that compare the situation we.
NEUT18|In the 1914 or 1918 of the last century, I don't believe we're gonna have hyperinflation be cause for for for what we can see the mechanisms of inflation and the drivers of inflation.
NEUT19|Czar actually somehow subdued and having to do for quite some time.
NEUT20|Because you see, inflation in asset prices.
BEAR21|We see inflation food so they stay circumscribes in some sectors.
NEUT22|So I'm not worried and after that I think we are going to be Greek.
NEUT23|You know?
NEUT24|I mean, we have to accept.
NEUT25|At least that 100% is the new 60% and that we're going to have to live with this debt overhang for quite some time, and so that will make the job of central banks to exit accommodative monetary policy very hard, because financial stability is not going to be an implicit target anymore, because we have very explicit target to avoid any type of second round effects like we saw in 2012 in Europe.
NEUT26|So so, this is for me.
NEUT27|Why is that play right now when it comes to debt inflation and not not like we fantasized version of the debt inflation do loop, but certainly something that will certainly put us in this.
NEUT28|"Very, you know difficult situation when it comes to debt, but only fiction I'm less worried than the average I would say."""
