BULL0|"""Lovely body welcome to my channel."
NEUT1|I hope you guys are doing well, so let's take a look to other technologies.
BEAR2|So today in a stock index is falling sharply and blueberries is falling as well.
NEUT3|So let's take a look to the chart.
NEUT4|So we have three Polish imposed.
NEUT5|First, one started right here.
NEUT6|After the pandemic emerged into any second one was activated right after that and completed at the end of 2020 and a third one was activated at the end of 2020 as well, with a target price of $73 that Uber hasn't been able to reach yet, so.
NEUT7|Of course, the situation right now so we can see this this important, diverse right here that I have that I have marked with this arrow disturbance in the mag.
NEUT8|While the price was going up was anticipating this disrupt of the price.
NEUT9|This is something we've seen in many, many stocks of the NASDAQ index from that.
NEUT10|That's kind of the reason why the indexes falling these days is correcting.
NEUT11|It's not even safe.
NEUT12|Following is correcting after.
NEUT13|After a very important bullish impossible so we don't know what the price is going to do right now, right?
BEAR14|I mean we can see the price falling that we do not have the prices reversing right away tomorrow or if it's moving down.
NEUT15|But that's something we cannot decide, of course.
NEUT16|But there's one thing we can decide on this and that is when we enter a trade.
NEUT17|When we buy a stock.
NEUT18|And in order to do that, we have to try to find the best entry point so that we put the alternate site if we buy right now, that's because we want to buy over just because of the fear of missing out.
NEUT19|If there is a reversal.
NEUT20|We won't have the odds in our side because that would be pretty much like a 50% price can go up.
NEUT21|Price can go down.
NEUT22|But if we want to adjust their entry point, there is one thing I could do for sure so.
BULL23|We have these these resistance right here from June 2020 that work as well very well as support right here.
NEUT24|At the end of January.
NEUT25|So if the price moves below and gets closer to this error here in the $47 we could also have the 200 moving average that could meet this.
NEUT26|The support level right there.
BULL27|So that could be definitely a better entry point than the than the level square we are right now.
BULL28|OK, so that's the thing we have to adjust our entry point and it would be a better opportunity and a better trade if we buy in this area right here.
NEUT29|Then if then if I right right now.
NEUT30|OK, because the price continues to move below.
BEAR31|Where we can see a unknown additional 9% drop.
NEUT32|But if we get there at least there's one thing we know for sure, and that's that we are buying in a support area where we have several indicators supporter here, 200 moving average there as well.
NEUT33|And we need.
NEUT34|That's a level that we know work as well.
NEUT35|In the past right here.
NEUT36|And right here China thing.
NEUT37|So these are the things to keep in mind, so we shouldn't buy stuff just because of we.
BEAR38|Fear to miss out if there's a bullish momentum.
NEUT39|OK, so there are plenty of stocks in the market and we should always try to adjust our entry point.
NEUT40|Alright, so thank you very much for watching if you like this, please subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for more videos.
