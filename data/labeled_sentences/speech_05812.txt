NEUT0|"""It's claimed the speed video chart on ticker symbol are Katie."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Another eventful day in this one.
NEUT5|Although I will say that from the presentation standpoint, this is the relatively tricky charts talk about 'cause there's a lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT6|What do I mean by that?
NEUT7|Well, if you were some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalp or whatever you want to call yourself and you bought right there, maybe you bought right there and your plan was to buy and sell it.
NEUT8|Then you know 25 minutes.
BEAR9|Well then from that point of view, yeah, the charts looking pretty rough.
BULL10|Now if you care about the bigger picture, things sure from the highs there's been a larger pullback, but from the grand scheme of it all, the price does still have plenty drop tuning chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT11|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT12|Just higher base is being.
NEUT13|Put in a play over extended periods of time and that's going to be the viewpoint that I'm talking about things from.
NEUT14|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be, you know you had more of a day trader type mentality.
NEUT15|Going into all this and a better illustrate this and I'm not saying that all this was going to happen, but just for.
NEUT16|Like I said, illustration purposes.
NEUT17|Let's say the price actually pulls back and goes down to the $26 mark.
BEAR18|So price comes down here to 26.
NEUT19|Behave like that and then begins to work its way upwards.
NEUT20|What would you have emphasis here on big picture?
NEUT21|Well from the big picture perspective, you'd have a set of those here.
NEUT22|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT23|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT24|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT25|You'd have lows down here and if you envision each one of these stair steps, well, what do you have?
NEUT26|Well, from the big picture, you'd still very very clearly have stairs up progressing the upward struction.
NEUT27|And again, that's what it truly showing movies going to overtime.
BULL28|It's going to make progress forward again.
NEUT29|I get it if you're a day trader and you bought right there.
NEUT30|There you don't care about these stair steps.
NEUT31|That's why I try to offer a warning.
NEUT32|That I would be coming from the bigger picture point of view.
BULL33|So sure today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days as you're doing here you can see the price still has plenty of oppurtunity, chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT34|So let's see if the Bulls can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT35|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT36|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird.
NEUT40|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT41|But in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT47|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT48|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT49|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT50|If you have any questions let me know.
