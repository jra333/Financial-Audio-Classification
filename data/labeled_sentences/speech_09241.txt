NEUT1|This is 1 new article from Bloomberg and this is the timing of this article.
NEUT2|In this article Kelvin Churchill said that he will raise 1.6 billions from 2 news packs.
NEUT3|An merger has not been confirmed yet.
NEUT4|That's why one person who has knowledge about it.
NEUT5|He confirmed it to the Bloomberg.
NEUT6|Everything has been written in this article about raising capital.
NEUT7|Everything is written in it about.
NEUT8|Raising the capital, we will talk about it.
NEUT9|But first, let's talk about those two images which are leaked from Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT10|So this was the leaked information on Bloomberg on 11th of January.
NEUT11|Venrock Associates proposed to sell lucid Motors to Churchill Capital.
NEUT12|This was the news leaked on 11th of January.
NEUT13|This status was proposed and earlier the payment type who's talking now it is cash.
NEUT14|Let me be clear.
NEUT15|This isn't confirming the merger or anything, but it's a step in the right direction.
BULL16|It's better than the most of speculation out there, but after seeing this article from Bloomberg I'm quite sure that this merger will go through.
NEUT17|In this article, Michael claim raised a combined capital of initial public offering, according to a person with knowledge of the matter of CC Ivy, that is Churchill Corp 6 raised.
NEUT18|480,000,000 apprised from 4,000,000 in the IPO said that person this person asked not to be identified.
NEUT19|Becaused this information is not public yet.
NEUT20|When Bloomberg asked Churchill about this or representative from Churchill declined to comment on this.
NEUT21|Right now the valuation of this lucid carmaker is about 15 billions.
NEUT22|So after this merger, the valuation of CC Ivy.
NEUT23|Would be around 15 billions.
NEUT24|JP Morgan is the leading Churchill IPO, while Churchill Seven is being advised by Citigroup.
NEUT25|This is 1 screenshot off Bloomberg Terminal right now.
NEUT26|The valuation of CC Ivy App App 30 is 8.3 billions, but according to Bloomberg the correct valuation of Lucid Motors is teen billions.
NEUT27|So in this case the price of CC.
BULL28|"Ivy should be double."""
