NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX empire."
BEAR1|Alphabet has carved a very unusual pattern since 2018, posting a series of new highs but forming this horizontal support level down by 1000.
BEAR2|Overall, this is produced a an expanding wedge pattern or broader deformation, which has a very bearish reputation.
BULL3|Even so, the stock broke out to a new high uh ahead of earnings report in late July, trading up to almost the 1600 level.
BEAR4|It pulled back into the earnings report and then failed to break out after the earnings report dropping to the 50 day moving average.
NEUT5|Now the stock needs to make a choice between new highs or breaking.
BEAR6|This moving Richard heading into a correction that could take it down to 1360 level and the 200 day moving average.
NEUT7|For now, it's undergoing a little bit of distribution.
NEUT8|As you can see.
NEUT9|Right after the earnings were released on July 31st and went into a distribution phase and it's being sold, but not that aggressively.
BULL10|In fact, the progression of new highs is continuing so that this these peaks up here are all time high, so there's still plenty of support under the stock.
NEUT11|However, it just can't seem to find its its sponsorship right in this area, so it needs to be watched closely, especially around the 1450 level.
BEAR12|In this upcoming week, cause a breakdown through that level could signal a correction that shakes out currently.
NEUT13|"Shareholders."""
