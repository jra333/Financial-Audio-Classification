BEAR1|We can see Apple has closed the low end of the.
BEAR2|Price and close nearly 1.5% lower than yesterday.
NEUT3|If we change chart into daily chart we can see here we got the second day of pull back and touched five days.
NEUT4|Year may.
BULL5|So it's still a bearish sign shorter, but in mid term this pullback is very constructive.
NEUT6|Unnecessary because we can see.
NEUT7|On each stage, this is the first stage we have a pull back to the EMS and then break out.

BEAR10|Keep the upgoing momentum North overbought, so in this area we consider dangerous signs that the volume is a little bit high so it means somebody is selling the stock for from the institutions.
NEUT11|This should be careful but in my opinion.
BULL12|In mid term the options channel kept intact, so it's a.
