BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to learn it all."
BEAR1|In this video, I'm going to talk about the two trades that I took on Guardian Health Science ticker symbol GHSIGHSIIP owed around $4.00 an April 2019 and has been falling down ever since then, but it has been consolidating for that last almost one year around.
NEUT2|The $0.20 Thirty cents area.
NEUT3|And we can see that the price action has been respecting this long term downtrend represented by this thick red line.
BULL4|But on December 23rd this downtrend was broken and we saw volume coming in and investors seems to be interested in this stock.
BULL5|Right now breaking of the trend with high volume.
BULL6|Tells us that the trend is reversing and this could be a huge gainer in the coming days, weeks, or months.
NEUT7|So let's look at the 15 minutes chart.
NEUT8|And you can see that on December 31st, when the market opened.
BULL9|Massive volume came in and was holding the $0.40 mark, so I got an around 4142 cents.
NEUT10|I don't exactly remember but I should be around 4142 cents and with 63,000 shares.
BULL11|I closed my positions around $0.61 and that gave me a profit of $9217.00 for the day.
BEAR12|The reason I close my positions is because the price was not able to break on the $0.64 mock for a few times and wasn't showing enough strength.
BULL13|So I close my positions but I was still optimistic that the price action looked seriously bullish and I added GHS I to my watchlist.
NEUT14|Now let's talk about my second trade on GHS I.
BULL15|So GHS I like I mentioned has been bullish and I am very bullish on GHS I.
NEUT16|So I was waiting for the next trade.
BULL17|And I got great confidence when the long term uptrend represented by the thick green line acted as a strong support.
NEUT18|So I got in around $0.48 a with forty 9800 shares.
BEAR19|Price was grinding around $0.50 and after hours that did move up to $0.56 I was holding on to my positions overnight and the next day it came down to $0.45 which is around the supporting trend.
NEUT20|But the massive move happened after hours when the price went up to $0.88.
NEUT21|I had to take profit shares, so I closed 39,800 shares and made a profit of $13,000.
NEUT22|But I'm still holding on to 10,000 shares and I will continue to hold these 10,000 shares for the next few weeks because I'm pretty optimistic that the price is probably going to go to $2.00 or $3.
NEUT23|So thank you for watching this video.
