NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR5|Will a rough day for Amazon, not because it was a red day, but from a technical point of view.
NEUT6|It actually progressed down an area that hasn't been for awhile and that all revolves around this area right here at the 3130 mark, which is to take you a quick trip down.
BULL7|You know the past history memory Lane here, but memory Lane shows that grated did a good job of acting as support did a good job of acting as support and then even earlier on in the day was doing a fantastic job of acting as support.
NEUT8|However, that ultimately failed, which brings about the big update here.
NEUT9|And, you know, love let's already pertains and will still pretend moving forward.
NEUT10|But this update is just based on a foundational role in charting.
NEUT11|Which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance and 3130 now going to be that near term area resistance where let me zoom back in here and you can see that that's already gone into effect so the price broke below it and then you can see a bunch of times right afterwards.
NEUT12|The price actually tried to get back above that level could never quite do it.
NEUT13|So the big question mark going forward is that if the price consolidates out and then it works the way back upwards, that's the big question mark.
NEUT14|Can the price not necessarily get back up to 3130?
NEUT15|But more importantly, can the price break above it and stay up above it?
BEAR16|As far as near term areas, areas of resistance are concerned that 3130 mark is going to be the first key battleground that will need to be broken through.
NEUT17|If it can, then the next key battleground after that will be that purple line up there.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Moving average which is currently valued at 3165.
NEUT20|So we want to keep a close eye on that.
NEUT21|Also, as far as areas of support are concern.
NEUT22|Next level of support.
NEUT23|Now with the price you know picking up some downside momentum going to be down there around the 3100 mark and then a 3100.
NEUT24|Can't you know hold up.
BEAR25|I mean nothing is guaranteed, but I don't think anybody would be shocked at that point to see the price then head down to the 3075 Mark if not even lower than that.
NEUT26|But like I said, I don't want to put too much emphasis on 3075 until the price at least violates the 3100 mark.
NEUT27|But those would be the main technical levels to watch.
BULL28|Now moving forward First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT30|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR36|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
