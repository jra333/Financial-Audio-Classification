NEUT0|"""If you're anything like me guys, you're on Facebook quite a lot, but on today's video I want to talk to you about turning the website that nearly all of us use on a daily basis into a profitable investment opportunity with binary options."
BULL1|Now Facebook has become one of the top stocks traded on the binary option market and with good reason.
NEUT2|It is a very volatile and popular stock.
NEUT3|So odds are as long as it is available to trade people on the market will do so.
NEUT4|The way to trade Facebook stock isn't very different from trading any other stock, but Facebook size makes it somewhat easier because news about it is always around us.
BEAR5|Facebook stock prices tend to be affected by two major items.
NEUT6|Advertising income and user numbers.
BULL7|Facebook is constantly seeking new and better ways to improve their income from advertising and additions to the site.
BULL8|And with a billion users worldwide, they have quite the ability to do so.
NEUT9|That being said, user numbers are crucial to Facebook success as it needs to maintain the appearance of being the place where all of us spend the bulk of our time.
NEUT10|Those two pieces of information often work together and are affected by each other.
NEUT11|So keep your eyes open for any news that may affect them.
NEUT12|Additionally, you should also take into account any purchases that Facebook makes.
NEUT13|Like with the messaging app WhatsApp, Facebook sometimes uses outside sources to strengthen its own status.
NEUT14|And that also can help you decide which position you should take on the market.
BULL15|I hope that has helped you a little.
NEUT16|"I'm Lexie and I hope you keep watching."""
