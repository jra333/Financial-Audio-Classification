NEUT0|"""My talking about your price target with the 3350 in the pressure on that even if some of the other bears have capitulated little bit Tobias Love Kevitch of Citigroup, David Kostin, Goldman Sachs, what are you seeing?"
NEUT1|That other bulls aren't seen?
NEUT2|Well, what I would say is that I mean, you know while our call you know this year was well timed and March and April to get aggressive, we've been surprised.
NEUT3|Quite frankly, just how fast not only the recovery is a curd, but the stock market itself has responded to that, and that's our bowl.
NEUT4|Cakes are both cases 3700 by June of next year, and it's looking more likely that that's going to become our base case.
NEUT5|I mean, this is not an exact science.
NEUT6|You know, that upside case is going to be driven by earnings growth?
NEUT7|That's that's been our views, right?
NEUT8|The the brief.
NEUT9|Revaluation of the stock market is already happened right.
NEUT10|the Fed has acted swiftly.
BEAR11|Rates have come down and multiples have expanded.
BEAR12|People have complained about that, saying, well, it doesn't really reflect reality.
NEUT13|But that's the way it always happens.
NEUT14|Taylor in a recession right?
BULL15|Multiples expand as earnings come down because the market knows that that's the troughs in 2021 is going to be a good year for earnings growth and quite frankly it's looking like it may be better than what most people are thinking.
NEUT16|And that's where we think people could be surprised next year.
BULL17|On the upside, the earnings growth is better.
NEUT18|Then what they're anticipating an it's earnings growth, and you also mentioned the Fed, and as you know more than anyone in that discount dividend model, it is that little are the rate at which you're discounting.
BEAR19|Future earnings inflates that present value, all thanks to the Fed.
NEUT20|How much though of that bull case scenario, which increasingly is looking like a base case.
NEUT21|Scenario 3700 is really dependent on rates at 0.
NEUT22|Yeah, it's it's a great question and it's been like I said before, it's you know this has been the main driver of the rally so far since March.
NEUT23|It's been a revaluation, right?
NEUT24|Equity risk.
BULL25|Premium is compressed, rates have stayed low and that means multiples can expand.
NEUT26|We think 90 to 95% of that is over, meaning it's very unlikely in our view.
BEAR27|If our scenario for V shape economic recovery plays out then it's very unlikely that 10 year yields are going to go to new lows from where we've been already.
BULL28|We think in fact that the more likely outcome is a 10 year yields rise.
BEAR29|And that could actually put pressure on multiples in the short term.
NEUT30|If that were to happen over the next two or three months.
NEUT31|But then we think the earnings is what's going to surprise on the upside, which is what drives the market next year, so I wouldn't be surprised if we stall out here in the near term.
BULL32|As you know, we could cover with the recovery, you know, the stimulus comes through, we get past the election rates, are able to rise, you know, earnings come in, but multiples compress.
NEUT33|And then next year is really an earning story and that drives the upside in the target that we've.
NEUT34|"We've talked about a minute ago."""
