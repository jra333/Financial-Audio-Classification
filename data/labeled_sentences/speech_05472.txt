NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol OCG."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well overall a decent day.
NEUT5|I wasn't terrible.
NEUT6|I actually I take that back.
NEUT7|I would consider a very good day because when you think about the amount of momentum that showed up.
NEUT8|On Thursday, it was a very real question of, you know, is this the start of something much bigger or things about to get that that much nastier?
NEUT9|And no, I mean, the price basically went sideways now with sideways like the most exciting thing ever, no, I mean it's not exciting.
BULL10|But again, when you factor in the context of how much downward pressure the thing had coming into the day just to see it go sideways, it's not a guarantee of anything, but it does offer up a sign of encouragement that, OK, maybe things weren't as bad as what they seemingly appeared on Thursday, and you know, it just goes back to this grid line here that I talked about.
BULL11|This video of support down there right around $9.30 so good to see that.
NEUT12|I mean right there it got somewhat close to it.
NEUT13|Then hit it exactly, but within the general vicinity.
NEUT14|But point here being good to see that the price you know never violated that area and moving forward that remains that near term key level of support right there again $9.30.
NEUT15|And then as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT16|The level that stands out to me now.
NEUT17|It's going to be that red line right there, and I think a lot of people have drawn that red line and I make that comment because when a lot of people are watching the same area and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy, you know call it whatever you want.
NEUT18|It can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT19|So my point here is that while nothing is guaranteed, it is a more than valid.
NEUT20|It is a more than rational thoughts.
BEAR21|Have that if the price were to come up there and break up through that level that that break in of itself could very well create quite a bit of upwards buying pressure.
NEUT22|Again, not saying that's what's going to happen, but that is, you know, an area that you know could very well become a very important factor moving forward.
NEUT23|But All in all.
NEUT24|Like I said, good salad, a good to see the price eventually at least just went sideways and not just a question of can the price regain some momentum next week we'll see what happens.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT34|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again totally live.
NEUT36|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT37|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
