NEUT1|This morning you're watching the quantized global Asian markets preview.
NEUT2|Today's April 17th, 2019.
NEUT3|I'm spending my time this morning looking at Chinese Adrs after yesterday's news that the US China trade deal is imminent, and following the Chinese economic report from one Q that was released last night.
BULL4|GDP grew 6.4% with factory output and retail sales topping market forecasts.
NEUT5|Some of my favorite China Adrs include Alibaba, Yum China, Wei Bao, wine HTHT.
NEUT6|If I were you, I would definitely check out those names.
BEAR7|Technical analysts are warning that the weakness in Russell 2K stocks is a warning sign for the current rally.
NEUT8|We were actually taking a different perspective.
BULL9|As we highlighted earlier this week, small cap ETF's are favourites.
BEAR10|Now we see the group outperforming large cap stocks coming out of earning season.
NEUT11|Remember, like we discussed last week?
BEAR12|Earnings expectations for one Q have been slashed the most in three years.
BULL13|Stocks are set for beaten race scenario, which will be a catalyst to drive a continuation in the current rally.
NEUT14|Now let me tell you about some really important stock news.
NEUT15|You need to be following this morning.
BEAR16|Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos argues against those who complain of its market power and at the company's annual letter to shareholders.
BEAR17|Critics complained that Amazon earns $0.50 of every dollar spent online in the US, and the Power Wheels is immense for many sellers who originally viewed Amazon as a partner now see them as a competitor.
BEAR18|Many sellers complained that Amazon now sells product similar to theirs at prices that undercut them in spots on the site that are more prominent than theirs.
NEUT19|Most sellers on Amazon are low to invite regulations, but at least seemed willing to listen to proposals.
NEUT20|Not really sure where this is going to end.
BULL21|Amazon.com has a very dominant market position with limited number of competitors.
BEAR22|IBM reports first quarter revenue that showed a drop in cloud computing and artificial intelligence revenue.
BEAR23|IBM blamed the drop on foreign exchange headwinds, saying that without those two revenue would have grown roughly 12%.
BULL24|Overall earnings were in line with expectations.
NEUT25|I've been expects to close acquisition of Red Hat later this year.
NEUT26|Its largest acquisition ever.
BULL27|One hope to feel its growth.
NEUT28|I'm not really following IBM, but it might be want to keep on your watch list.
BULL29|Netflix reports second quarter guidance for subscriber additions that trails analysts expectations.
BEAR30|Netflix expects to add 5,000,000 net subscribers in two Q, well below the six point 1,000,000 forecast.
BULL31|Just as a point of comparison, Netflix added 9.6 million subscribers in the first quarter, beating expectations of 8.96 million.
NEUT32|I'm closely following the stock options markets were implying at 6% move ahead of earnings.
BULL33|Right now the stock is only up 1 to 2% in premarket trading.
BULL34|Pepsi reports first quarter results that beat expectations on the strength of its sales of its drinks and snacks.
BULL35|Stacks are jumped over 5% in revenue growth last quarter.
BULL36|Pepsi says it will continue strong advertising to maintain the momentum.

BULL38|And finally, Qualcomm and Apple have come to final agreement to end all litigation between the two companies.
BULL39|Qualcomm and Apple Son is 6 year supply agreement with a 2 year option to extend.
NEUT40|As a result of the deal, Intel says it's no longer going to continue its efforts to grab a larger share of the mobile handset chip market until it spent years trying to break into the market's plan to launch 5G chips in 2020.
