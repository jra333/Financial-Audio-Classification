NEUT0|"""Welcome traders to freetradingvideos.com."
NEUT1|This is a trade taken serious Siri.
BULL2|And I was watching this in today as it was shaping up and the next day at gapped up an as I cleared the 200 Mai decided to buy long into this trade even though there's some pretty good overhead resistance here.
NEUT3|Right on this stock and also back in here.
NEUT4|Alright, so I'm watching those things carefully.
BULL5|I am filled on the trade though an I like it the way it closed very high volume could break out clothes right near its high as well.
NEUT6|No upper shadow, meaning that the people who own it don't want to sell it or the end of the day.
NEUT7|Even even the people who are day trading don't want out of it.
BULL8|The stock then did a very nice job.
BULL9|Good gap up.
NEUT10|Ran right up into this resistance area.
NEUT11|Let some of these people out of pain.
BEAR12|Right, so bit of a sell off stock 22 that worked its way out and then gapped up.
NEUT13|This is a big news event.
NEUT14|A very popular shock jockey who you might be aware of decided to sign on with them at this time and I took half of my shares off the table right here right at the open.
NEUT15|It's a very good I'm my way in the money.
BULL16|I'm not chasing this with a good protective stop and I'm waiting for this stock to put in a nice swing low here, but to make it much higher so I need a higher swing load to keep that uptrend intact.
NEUT17|So I do have that nice rounding pattern here.
NEUT18|Stock then spins its wheels for quite some time.
BEAR19|This was a good bit of overhead resistance through here.
NEUT20|Now people were actually buying that stock up here thinking it was just going to go up there now upside down in that trade.
NEUT21|They're going to need to get out when it comes back to them.
BULL22|Alright, so choose along here for a while and finally breaks out increasing volume as the people in the short side.
NEUT23|Now buy to cover new buyers.
NEUT24|Jump in.
NEUT25|I didn't catch that trade and add to it, but I still have half of my position and I wrote this stock all the way up.
BEAR26|There's a huge percent gain for this stock and I got stopped out on that day right at the open.
BULL27|So very, very good.
BULL28|I had preserved those profits very nicely on the other half of my trade and I would do that over and over again if I could.
NEUT29|So let's see what the stock went.
NEUT30|Just for fun, nice, unfilled gap, big resistance.
BEAR31|The stocks were just chopped around head South.
BULL32|It's a very good.
NEUT33|I'll take that anytime in the market.
NEUT34|Will deliver it to me or everybody will thank you for attending free tradingvideos.com.
