NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, I'm Robert Brokamp, senior advisor for the Pools Retirement service and we're back with another episode of Ask Fool."
NEUT1|Today's question is.
NEUT2|What is a good way to diversify a generous inheritance?
NEUT3|Around $500,000 makes me nervous.
NEUT4|Keeping it in stocks, at least for now.
NEUT5|I'm going to liquidate most of it until I can educate myself further on how to best invest it.
BEAR6|We are losing sleep over this.
NEUT7|Well, I don't want you to lose sleep.
NEUT8|Your risk tolerance is important in terms of how much you have in the stock market.
NEUT9|So if you're losing sleep, it might be a good idea to get it out of the market for now.
NEUT10|The good news about when you inherit investments is that the cost basis of the investment is as of the date of death of the person you inherited it from.
NEUT11|So in other words, if you sell the investments pretty soon after you inherit it, there won't be many tax consequences.
NEUT12|What do you do with the money at that point?
NEUT13|Well, first of all, if you have any credit card debt.
NEUT14|You should probably pay that off average rate on a credit card these days is 15%.
NEUT15|The only reason you wouldn't pay that off is if you think you could invest it and beat that rate.
BEAR16|That would be very difficult to do.
NEUT17|Pay it off.
NEUT18|Guaranteed investment return of 15% because you have eliminated that debt.
NEUT19|Second of all, any money you need in the next three to four or five years, you should keep it in cash.
NEUT20|CDs very safe.
NEUT21|Short term bonds may be so that you do not put it in the stock market.
NEUT22|So if you're going to do any home repairs, children going to college anything like that you want to keep that money out of the stock market and very safe now from there, if they decide what you're going to invest in stocks, bonds, which these days, frankly, are not very attractive.
NEUT23|International stocks, those types of things.
NEUT24|Any money that you need in the next 5 ten, 20-30 years is a candidate for the stock market.
BULL25|Again considering your risk tolerance and wiatru retirement, believe that diversification is very important.
NEUT26|So international stocks U.S. stocks, small stocks, big stocks, those types of things, low cost mutual funds or index funds are great choices for someone who is learning.
NEUT27|Just starting out investing, you can get such a thing from all kinds of low cost providers.
NEUT28|Vanguard is one choice Fidelity.
NEUT29|Schwab, T Rowe Price, all of them have these options.
NEUT30|Or you could buy exchange traded funds which are also low cost versions of index funds.
NEUT31|Now by staying out of the stock market, you are avoiding one type of risk which is volatility and that the investment will go down.
NEUT32|But whenever you avoid one risk, you're probably taking on another, and they're not the other risk that you are taking on by staying out of the stock market is that you won't have enough money to reach your goals, and for most people that's retirement, and that's a trade off.
NEUT33|You're just going to have to decide, because if you keep it out of the stock market, keep it in cash or short term bonds, you're really not going to earn very much money, in fact, you.
NEUT34|At these days, you'll earn practically nothing special when you consider taxes and inflation, so that's the trade off if you have other resources.
NEUT35|If you have a good pension, something like that that you'll be able to rely on in retirement, especially if it will cover most of your retirement expenses, then you can play it safer in your investment portfolio.
NEUT36|If you do not have that, then either you have to take a little bit more risk to get that higher return so that you reach retirement goals, or you play it safer for what that means.
NEUT37|Is you will have to save a lot more and do some calculations to make sure that at that virtually no rate of return you'll still meet your goals.
NEUT38|So that's the answer.
