NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX empire."
BULL1|Netflix returned to the 2018 high in the four 20s in April 2020, and broke out.
BULL2|Spent about two months turning back and forth across the breakout level and then took off with one strong rally way that get up almost to the 600 level in July.
BULL3|Well, that's pretty much the highest high in the last eight months after a sturdy pull back to the 50 day moving average.
BEAR4|A lot of action there failed.
BEAR5|Breakout attempt failed breakout attempt in January, another failed breakout attempt.
BEAR6|So now this stock has been pulling back since that January failed breakout attempt coming all the way down to the 200.
BULL7|Moving average for the first time since March of 2020.
NEUT8|Accumulation is just sort of flatlined here.
BULL9|Very tropey with a lot of disagreement and the stock is trading under the 50 day moving average and testing that level following a upgrade from a boutique firm on Tuesday morning.
NEUT10|Now this is a real mixed bag.
BULL11|There's some good things here.
NEUT12|Number one we have these three horizontal loads of scuse me 4 horizontal lines right here in here.
BEAR13|But now we have a higher low here.
BEAR14|A higher low here in a potentially a higher low here now that's.
NEUT15|Sort of stair stepping up.
BULL16|That's a good thing as the especially as the 200 moving average is coming up.
NEUT17|There's still a lot of disagreement what's going to happen with Netflix this year, especially with folks getting out of their homes and getting back into the physical world.
NEUT18|In addition, it looks like a Disney's eating Netflix is lunch right now.
BEAR19|"Taking subscribers directly from them, and if we see any fluctuation in growth here at the next earnings report, the stock could breakdown and head towards the four hundreds or even the three hundreds."""
