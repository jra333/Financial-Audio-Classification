NEUT0|"""As for Moderna, another Monday here Jim with 100% on Sevier, an more discussion that come spring we might have nearly ten of these things to choose from."
NEUT1|Well, this is a rather remarkable moment because it is true.
NEUT2|This is warp speed and warp speeds run by the army and it's going to be run by.
NEUT3|It's going to go to long term care facilities at the same time.
NEUT4|It's going to go to healthcare workers, but I think the good news here.
NEUT5|It's going to go to a lot of people that no one thought they could get to very early.
NEUT6|You shotgun the the entire level when you include Moderna and don't even talk about J&J.
NEUT7|Moderna and Pfizer.
NEUT8|I think that everybody in this country we have the opportunity to be vaccinated by May.
BULL9|I think a lot of people who are in a high risk category will be able to get vaccinated.
NEUT10|January February, March David.
NEUT11|I gotta tell you, I think that warp speed is being run a nonpolitical way.
BULL12|In a way we can be proud of in a way that will make it so that we are headed toward her immunity.
NEUT13|Even if a lot of people decide to opt out really God, you're being very positive.
BULL14|I'm happy to hear it.
BULL15|I hope you're right.
BULL16|May would be a wonderful thing being that we would have then potentially normalization over the summer for so many and people returning to work in a full way.
NEUT17|Jim again, if you're right, what about the transition to the Biden administration?
NEUT18|If you know again there there finally getting I think full briefings and there is real communication going on so you feel more confident that that handoff in terms of warp speed and the distribution of the vaccine is not going to be impeded by the change administration and the lack of communication that is taking place here.
NEUT19|Before I think the military.
NEUT20|Has never been political about this, and this is militarily led.
NEUT21|Yes, it is absolutely, and what it's going to do is it's going to go to CVS.
NEUT22|It's going to go to Walgreens is going to go to Walmart plus a lot of grocery stores.
NEUT23|I think it's you'll be able to, let's say CVS.
NEUT24|Let's talk CVS.
NEUT25|You'll be able to go to CBS's website, get an appointment and you'll be able to get it.
NEUT26|Particularly, we have to find out tomorrow or Wednesday about what the order is.
NEUT27|We don't know what the order is beyond nursing home long term care and then health care workers.
NEUT28|They will be able to get it on site and then it should be able to go to the drug stores, the supermarkets we're going to wait to see what the government says is going to be the reality of what you're going to have.
NEUT29|People who are 65 N rehab, 75 N or we have people with pre-existing but geez, I couldn't believe how exciting this is going to be.
NEUT30|I do hope that people take it.
BEAR31|I think that you're going to feel like if you didn't take it, you may feel left out in the end because this is going to be very easy to get.
NEUT32|It's gonna be two shots you go to your CVS.
NEUT33|You go for one and then three weeks later go for another.
NEUT34|If you don't get the second one, then it doesn't work.
BULL35|You'll be able to get a card, Carl, that shows you that you got it.
NEUT36|It's going to go to your cell phone too, and I think you'll be able to say I am inoculated and it's the way to be able to get back to where we were.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT38|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
