NEUT0|"""Scott, how many shares should you invest in?"
NEUT1|I mean, that's such a good question so you don't need visual companies here.
NEUT2|There's an academic answer, and that's probably the best place to start.
BULL3|And the academic data seems to be updated reasonably regularly.
NEUT4|The current thinking is between 15 and 30 companies is the minimum number to get the maximum benefit of diversification.
NEUT5|Now, diversification doesn't mean two of everything.
NEUT6|The old Noah's Ark approach.
NEUT7|Diversification is managing a spectrum of risk factors across your portfolio.
NEUT8|You want something that's exposed to Australian housing.
NEUT9|Some of this exposed to information technology.
NEUT10|Something is exposed to American manufacturing in ways that change the industry that geography, the currency, the types of risks.
NEUT11|The top substantial returns that are in your portfolio, and the Economic Research suggests that between 15 and 30 is the right number to maximize the value of that diversification.
NEUT12|Now again, it's really important to 15 banks or 15 retailers is not diversification, so.
NEUT13|Is not just the number of companies, but it's the spread of those companies 15 to 30 companies that are broadly representative of the market is the way you maximize the benefit of diversification.
NEUT14|15 companies randomly chosen same thing, just be very, very careful.
NEUT15|Don't own 10 retailers, 10 banks, 10 minors.
NEUT16|That's not diversification, that's just you know, a collection of the same sorts of assets.
NEUT17|So 15 to 30 is the right time for most people.
NEUT18|Generally speaking, we say The Motley Fool.
NEUT19|Get the 15 companies as quickly as you possibly can, because if you are in one company that goes up 50%, you think you're a genius.
BEAR20|If it falls 50%, you probably discovered put off.
NEUT21|You're not going to want to invest, so there's a question of how many.
NEUT22|There's a question of how quickly, and we did.
NEUT23|We still say get to 15 as quickly as you possibly can, just to make sure your portfolio is a diversified and be not necessarily as subject to the the movements of the market.
NEUT24|The ebbs and flows the the shocks of both pessimism and optimism when it comes to investing, you want to have a more stable, secure, diversified portfolio.
NEUT25|Is there such thing as owning too many shares?
NEUT26|There is?
NEUT27|If you can't wait.
NEUT28|Two reasons, if you can't keep track of my own any companies.
NEUT29|I mean we did this for a job I couldn't keep track of any companies more.
NEUT30|Follow my tried I just I physically can't keep across in detail that many companies.
NEUT31|So that's one reason why it might be too many.
NEUT32|If you've got some individual services like our servers that give you advice, all of those companies that can be OK.
NEUT33|But if you're alone in your own ability, time, effort to keep in touch, too many companies welcome.
NEUT34|You can keep track of is too many other thing I would say is be very careful about where you want to put your money.
NEUT35|If you're putting money in your 101st best ID.
NEUT36|There's every chance that you will by passing a whole better idea so, but I get to 3035 forty companies.
NEUT37|You kind of saying, well, hang on if this is my best idea.
NEUT38|There are 13 owner by definition.
BULL39|Not my best idea and you start to diversify almost to mediocrity.
NEUT40|So the right number is not too many that you can't keep track and not so many of you putting money into your 1500 worst idea.
NEUT41|You're concentrating your cash to some degree, not to be too concentrated, but you're investing your best idea at any point in time.
NEUT42|And last question, do you think owning too many can therefore?
NEUT43|Impact your overall returns or the potential of your returns?
NEUT44|Yeah, absolutely, and that's where I'm at in development to mediocrity.
BEAR45|You end up affectively getting a market return, maybe even worse if you're not paying too much attention.
NEUT46|So yeah, you want to be able to concentrate your attention on a diversified portfolio and use both of those terms interchangeably, so making sure you have enough diversification, but not too much somewhere in the range of 15 to 30 stocks.
BULL47|You said it much better than I did.
BULL48|"Excellent, thanks, God, thanks right."""
