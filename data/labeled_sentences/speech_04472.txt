BULL0|"""Multiple expansion is what we saw today when Wall Street got hyped about the best of the best look at what lettuce hired."
NEUT1|Start with Apple.
NEUT2|OK, and it's always fun to start with Apple, 'cause you know how much I like it about you.
NEUT3|Follow Apple.
NEUT4|I follow out Apple.
NEUT5|We all know that they launched a new phone tomorrow and you gotta be under rock, not too.
NEUT6|It's the ultimate non event event because new iPhones come out like clockwork so everyone has on the calendar.
NEUT7|We all know what's going to happen.
NEUT8|We know there will be a mix of positives and negatives about size, weight, cost, color and always is the case that even with 5G in it and then we end up buying it of course.
NEUT9|It's almost a dog bites man story.
BEAR10|Yet that didn't stop Wedbush.
NEUT11|Is Dan Ives nice person publishing a piece titled The Grand Entrance for iPhone 12 begins Cook Kick kicks off Super cycle Tuesday.
BULL12|He calls it the most important launch in six years before describing it as a once in a decade product launch, he points to stepped up demand for components for the larger version, which is true.
BULL13|We know that from Marvel we know that by the way, Skyworks solutions will probably have an upside surprise.
NEUT14|And he says that China is the linchpin of this whole.
NEUT15|Thesis again, dog bites man, let me read you one.
BULL16|Let's say pertinent snippet quote cooking company had the stage set for Supercycle product release which should drive shares further in our opinion and quote.
NEUT17|Well, well, well a super cycle, huh?
NEUT18|Listen when you call something super cycle you're going to catch peoples attention.
NEUT19|Unfortunately, I'm superstitious about super cycles that words the ultimate jinx we heard about the cold super cycle in 2011, right before the entire country crash and burn.
BEAR20|It was a once in a lifetime collapse.
NEUT21|In October 2014, Morgan Stanley quote for a fracking sand supercycle that was almost exactly where the price of oil peaked kick you off a multi year meltdown to sand fracking.
NEUT22|Or fracking sand or whatever.
NEUT23|So in this analyst talks about an iPhone Super super cycle.
NEUT24|I feel like he's tempting fate.
NEUT25|That said, you know I like Apple, I think you should own it, not trade it.
NEUT26|But people are going to buy it today and they're going to sell it tomorrow because it didn't go higher again.
BULL27|We've seen this time and again, the bar is now been set so high going into launch that there's a good chance Apple will disappoint today's buyers.
BULL28|The darn thing rallied more than 6% today.
BULL29|Talk about Great Expectations.
NEUT30|Siri will the stock go still higher?
NEUT31|Here's quizzical.
NEUT32|Then there's Amazon which jumped almost 5% unless you're living under a Rock You know tomorrow's Amazon Prime Day, which is actually two days this year.
NEUT33|Go figure that out, right?
NEUT34|We're in a pandemic, we know there's going to be a ton of shopping, but why not wait?
NEUT35|But that's not how John Blackledge accounts these things.
BULL36|Today he jumped the gun and gave it you a preview that's outrageously bullish on Prime Day and the extended holiday shopping, he's expecting a demand surge, which suggests a permanence of shifting consumer behavior.
BULL37|Yeah, I know.
NEUT38|I know why you like today.
NEUT39|You have to say it.
NEUT40|You have to say today.
NEUT41|I mean again, there's nothing wrong with this piece.
NEUT42|It's just that it brings nothing new to the table.
NEUT43|'cause everybody kind of knows this stuff already.
BEAR44|Personally, I think it's better to say nothing because now the stock is Ward ahead and it'll be harder for Amazon to live up to the Prime Day hype.
