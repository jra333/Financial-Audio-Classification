BULL0|"""Welcome back to the 12 chance of Christmas today."
NEUT1|Let's take a look at the bond market and the critical question when it comes to long dated bonds is how low can yields go.
NEUT2|As you can see, Japanese government bonds have been on the floor for a generation.
BULL3|Now one of the great surprises of 2014 was the full in US.
NEUT4|Long yields suggested that investors weren't so confident for the future, even if other indicators of the US suggested they were, but perhaps most critically.
NEUT5|You can see this collapse in German bunds heels, plainly suggesting great fears about deflation, and that raises a question which we can address with this next chart about what central banks will do.
BULL6|As you can see, the Fed has already very dramatically expanded its balance sheet in an attempt to avert deflation since Abby's been empowering in Japan.
BEAR7|You've seen as very similar move afoot in the Bank of Japan.
BEAR8|What is quite remarkable is that over the last two years, as Europe appears to have been sliding into deflation, the balance sheet of the European Central Bank has actually shrunk.
NEUT9|Everybody, I think expect that at some point during the coming year the ECB will cease to be the old one out and will start trying to raise its balance sheet, possibly while the Fed tries to contract its balance sheet.
NEUT10|It's very reasonable to expect that it's a critical question whether that is actually going to happen.
NEUT11|"Next time we'll take a look at commodities and emerging markets."""
