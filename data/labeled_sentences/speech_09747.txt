NEUT0|"""You share some of your research with us."
NEUT1|You have some pretty lofty price targets for manderlys.
NEUT2|For Kraft Heinz, you also have a very bullish outlook for a company called Simply Foods that puts out kind of healthy snacks going into Q1.
NEUT3|With those twin forces, the vaccine potentially another variant where you see pantry loading.
NEUT4|Where do you see that stocking up on snacks?
NEUT5|We think right now for the industry, we're not really seeing much.
NEUT6|Then we have pantry loading.
NEUT7|You had so much at home demand throughout the year.
BEAR8|There's not really a lot, you know in in folks pantries at this point in time, we think the biggest issue for this industry is just weak sentiment across the board.
BEAR9|And we think these stocks have not recovered from the cost.
NEUT10|Cutting three to five years ago.
NEUT11|Which really you know drug sales.
BULL12|Because across the space you see that in valuations where food stocks traded a 30% discount relative to household products and beverages unforward numbers, that's twice the typical valuation gap.
NEUT13|So we think there's low expectations for growth.
BEAR14|In 2021-2022 low valuation.
NEUT15|We think now is a really good time to be looking at these food stocks.
BEAR16|Overall for total returns in terms of the snacking space, we've seen outsized growth for this category and missing.
NEUT17|You know, for a number of years now.
NEUT18|We like this base quite a bit and we think looking at basically in the US we think healthy snacking is the way to go.
NEUT19|You're looking at the CDC.
BEAR20|You're modeling 40% of US consumers being obese now even with kovid, and you're the worst outcomes for folks are those with with.
NEUT21|Your diabetes and obesity.
NEUT22|We think a big focus going forward will be sugar reduction, much like tobacco with the public health issue for the past 20 years, we think sugar is a health issue going forward.
NEUT23|So in that space we like low carb, low sugar snacking, simply good foods.
NEUT24|As you mentioned in our topic in that healthy snacking space, maker of Atkins Quest Nutrition lot of Runway for growth there on the indulgent side, you indulgent is not going away either.
NEUT25|You mentioned Manderlys Global Leader in that space.
BULL26|You like the opportunity to grow globally there as well, and the double DPS growth.
NEUT27|Yeah, I don't think people are giving up Oreos anytime soon.
NEUT28|Expectations was a word that you used the comps for these companies.
BULL29|They should be pretty favorable up until April.
NEUT30|So before then, what kind of performance do you see for these stocks?
BULL31|And do you think that investors understand that a 7% growth in sales year over year in December is actually really good for this sector?
NEUT32|We did.
BULL33|I mean, we know historically you've seen this industry growth more or less in line population growth once the 2% year to date that we've seen grocery sales up double digits, you know 1012%, even as recently as high single digits 10% in December.
BULL34|Our expectation is that until you laughed at the pantry stocking we saw in March when Covid first hit look continue to see high single digit revenue growth for this space.
NEUT35|In terms of the stocks we imagine will be flattish through March, April.
NEUT36|We think some value investors right now with a 1218 month time Horizon.
BEAR37|Are looking at it saying ya'll low valuations, low expectations, even post covid going forward.
NEUT38|Now is the time to get involved at Yolo valuation so you think you'll value investors more of a multi year time horizon are buying now.
NEUT39|We think you know some of the shorter term pony you know there's gonna be a waiting period until after those those card com cycle in March and April for some of the short term to get back involved in the space.
