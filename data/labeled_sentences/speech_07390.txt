BULL15|Apple Price target raised to one 42142.
NEUT16|I like it.
NEUT17|I like it.
BULL18|Yahoo Price target raised to 153.
NEUT19|Got good stuff all around around Apple.
NEUT20|They are making money of course.
NEUT21|Earnings per share.
NEUT22|3.69 P 33.
BULL23|That's very good.
NEUT24|Apple announced that they are building a massive battery storage project at its California Solar Panel farm using Teslas.
NEUT25|Usually utility scale megapack batteries as a storage system.
NEUT26|Pretty big deal and this is a move towards green energy.
NEUT27|This has been one of the first instances which Wall Street attached a price tag to the Apple Car opportunity as well.
NEUT28|The bank believes, therefore, that that 10% of Apple's equity value in the foreseeable future can be attributed to the autonomous Vehicle segment.
BULL29|This would be enough to make the new car one of Apple's most valuable products from the start as well, with probably quite a bit of long term potential.
NEUT30|On top of that.
NEUT31|So really good news to see an ample taking a look at the chart.
BULL32|Beautiful upward trend apples.
NEUT33|One of my favorite stocks recently we start shot.
BEAR34|Got beat down from the most recent correction.
BULL35|It did break this downward trend.
NEUT36|Held this support at $119 or share.
NEUT37|Now is about 123.
NEUT38|I've gotta buy target on this at 1:22.
BULL39|I think it'll pull back to 122 with a price target at 142.
BULL40|142 on the South side for me and I think that looks fantastic.
NEUT41|So there you go with Apple.
BULL42|This is a good one.
