NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Daniel sent today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about the CU Doctor Peter Incorporated with Sticky Key GP and I'm filming this because you can see volume around 56 million crates yesterday and I really like this rich and an alcoholic stop so because they are stable and they paying dividends and it is simple business I think and you can find here some.
NEUT2|Videos about the same stocks as I have a lots of our products, more than 170 brands and you can see some of them on the screen.
NEUT3|Cannot drive Doctor Pepper crush Sunkist, some juice, Motts and Green Mountain Co here it's all started from this brand and then they buy kuric and in 2018 as they bought Doctor Pepper.
NEUT4|And now have a super big company and also they produce some coffee machines.
NEUT5|I think it is a some kind of diversification.
NEUT6|Here you can see some coffee brands, Green Mountain donut Shop and Krispy Kreme.
NEUT7|I really like this one, flowered the soft drinks like 7 after squared high as Schweppes chin waters and in Russia avian really.
NEUT8|Popular and some juices and energy drinks like venom.
NEUT9|Here you can see some quick overview of 10 Q report and it is brilliant because you can see how they perform versus 2019 and it is really nice.
BULL10|They grow and you know that we have some global situation and it is not a problem for this talk and I think it is a super nice sun.
BULL11|On Gurufocus we can see that they grow.
NEUT12|On a coffee brand and it is nice an now they bought Doctor Pepper is stable company too.
NEUT13|I think this Tucker don't have any problems with the cash and it is absolutely safe long term debt to equity on the 0.5.
NEUT14|It is not a problem at all.
NEUT15|Also we don't have any problems with payout rater or short lot, only two point 4% the price now I think.
NEUT16|OK, nothing suspicious on institutional ownership.
NEUT17|And here on a charter you can see this a doctor pepper.
NEUT18|Buy this stock.
NEUT19|Definitely have something like trend line and it is like this and there's a resume.
NEUT20|I think it is a really nice stock with dividends around 2% with a really nice like eager.
BULL21|They're expecting around 20% profit margin, not really high, only 10%, but on a long term I think it is OK because their sales more than $11 billion per year and over $1,000,000 in income.
BULL22|It is OK.
BULL23|I think this volume spike is some kind of big bye.
NEUT24|Alright, hoping for this, what do you think about Kuryk Doctor Pepper in key?
