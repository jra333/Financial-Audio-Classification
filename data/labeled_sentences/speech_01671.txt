BULL0|"""Welcome to trading nation."
BEAR1|Let's talk bowing down more than 2% on Thursday, but one of the worst sessions in nearly three months.
BULL2|The stock still up 16% year to date.
BULL3|It is more than doubled in the past year.
BULL4|What an incredible run, but should buy more or take some profit.
NEUT5|Mark temper.
NEUT6|Strategic wealth partners.
NEUT7|Airy wall with Oppenheimer Mark.
NEUT8|I don't know if I've seen a run like this from from kind of an older line company.
NEUT9|No offense to billing at all.
NEUT10|They're not, you know, Google.
NEUT11|They're not Netflix.
NEUT12|Their Boeing.
NEUT13|They make planes.
BEAR14|They've got a big backlog, but do you get nervous when a stock like Boeing doubles in a year?
BULL15|I do, I mean, it's it's 114% year over year and over the last five years the stocks up 340% while revenues are only up 12%.
BULL16|Earnings are up 70% over the same timeframe, so the gains have really been driven by multiple expansion because of this expectation of clear skies in the future, the fundamentals are good, you know, demands increasing due to increased passenger and freight traffic.
NEUT17|Last year they project the demand of 39,000 jets.
BULL18|This year it's up to 41,000 jets, so on the margin demands increasing.
BULL19|Most of their growth is going to be coming from their single aisle 737 jets because of the popularity of the low cost airline business.
BULL20|Strong international growth there?
BULL21|I mean, they're seeing that coming out of China and India and from a risk perspective the revenues are spread across 90 countries, so that's all good.
NEUT22|The problem is the valuation you were looking at like 30 times forward earnings.
NEUT23|Facebook that I think 26 Googles at around 2627.
NEUT24|So it's a little rich for us.
NEUT25|We think if you're trying to get in you might be a little too late to the party at this time.
NEUT26|Yeah, I mean what a move here.
NEUT27|Certainly good news, I just don't know if it justifies the double Ry we strip out the emotion.
NEUT28|You look at the chart.
NEUT29|It sits above everything right.
NEUT30|Every moving average.
NEUT31|Everything is it.
NEUT32|Is it overbought?
BULL33|It is overbought an we agree it's it's.
BEAR34|It's late to the party, I just don't think that's a bad thing that I see.
NEUT35|This is a terrific example of the persistence of market leadership and the rules some momentum investing in where momentum investors is to let your winners run.
NEUT36|You gotta make sure you have the big winners to offset your smaller losses.
NEUT37|We'd rather be selling are losers, so if you've been if you're in Boeing.
NEUT38|If you've been in Boeing, there's nothing to do you let it run.
BEAR39|There's been no cracks or.
BEAR40|Breakdowns or signs that leadership is slowing.
NEUT41|If you've been worried about overbought conditions, you've been out of this thing for the last 100%.
NEUT42|If you're putting new money to work, indeed, it's not tactically attractive here, it's extended and I think do for some bit of a pause in the support levels were watching or probably closer to 300 and 3:15 range, so I'd probably like to see a little bit of a correction and some stabilization before putting new money to work, but no signs that this is the top in Boeing.
BULL43|Just yeah, OK technically looks good.
BULL44|Mark says maybe better opportunities elsewhere.
NEUT45|Market area.
BULL46|Thank you both very much.
BULL47|And folks, as always, thank you for tuning in.
