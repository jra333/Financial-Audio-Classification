NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for July 14th, 2015."
NEUT1|I'm Celina, Nicholas, technical analysts at xm.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at crude oil on the daily chart.
BEAR3|Crude oil prices remain on the downside with risk for losses to the key 50 level.
BEAR4|Technical studies support the underlying bearishness, especially since the tank concern line crossed below the Kijun Sen line.
NEUT5|This happened early in July.
BEAR6|Also, the RSI is below 50 in bearish territory.
NEUT7|One when prices fell below Ichimoku cloud.
BEAR8|UN fell outside on July 6th.
BULL9|This reinforced the bears.
NEUT10|The 50.0 level is actually a very critical level, and it's acting as support, so break below.
BEAR11|It would accelerate the fall towards 42.84.
BEAR12|This was the low of March 16th.
BEAR13|To the upside, immediate resistance is seen at 53.79 this weeks high.
NEUT14|Looking at the bigger picture though.
BEAR15|The trend has been bearish since the decline from 107.45.
BEAR16|This was in June 2014 and prices fell all the way down to multi year low of 42.84.
BULL17|Only moved back above 63.59 and above the 200 day moving average.
BULL18|This would weaken the bearish bias and shift it back to the upside.
BULL19|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
