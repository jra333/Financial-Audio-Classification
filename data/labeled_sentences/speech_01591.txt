NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol B Kyi."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, I mean the the obvious but I will anyways.
BULL4|Very nice movement today on this one when you stop and think about the fact that just on Tuesday the price had been all the way down that low and also in the price has worked its way all the way up to that area.
NEUT5|Any rational person would say yeah that's definitely been a very nice move but that does little valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT9|And I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind, and revolves around a single area and that area is right down here at the 64 cent mark.
NEUT11|Why $0.64 important?
NEUT12|I'm not saying this is what's going to actually happen, but let's say that the price were to come down here to 64 and then just keep on going.
NEUT13|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT14|Will from a very literal POV that would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out up and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT15|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength or is on the flip side.
NEUT16|Maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT17|Behave in that manner, then start to work to way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here you have those lows down there.
NEUT19|If you envision each one of those as stair steps, well, hey there we go.
NEUT20|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT21|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT22|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL23|It's going to make progress forward and again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined right there at $0.64.
NEUT24|In the event the price starts to work its way upwards.
NEUT25|Next, key level is going to be right there at the 69 cent mark.
NEUT26|As far as areas of resistance are concerned and that would be followed by where the party stop today in a couple occasions right up there at 73.
NEUT27|But on all any angle you look at things, nice movement today, not just a question of can the price show some signs of progress and build upon this momentum?
NEUT28|Let's see how it plays out on Thursday.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT39|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT40|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT41|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT42|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT43|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
