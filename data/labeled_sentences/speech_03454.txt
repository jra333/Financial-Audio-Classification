NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol GE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very nice follow through from the nice little bounce that occur Dawn Friday.
NEUT5|So certainly some updates here need to be done first thing to do is actually a little house cleaning.
NEUT6|Just get rid of that line right there, that level sure it still pertains, just not relevant right now from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines are very long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, But the first update that needs to be done comes about based on a foundation rule in charge in which states.
BEAR7|One levels of resistance are broken and closed above.
NEUT8|They tend to act as support.
NEUT9|You want to see them act as support so now moving forward right there.
BULL10|Around that 1270 Cent Mark that is going to be the ideal level of support.
NEUT11|But I'm going to go in and adjust this level up to even a better level and that will be up here at 13.
NEUT12|Now let me be very clear if the price falls below 13, that does not imply the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL13|But I mean if the price could somehow managed to actually stay above 13, that would be a very very impressive sign of power.
NEUT14|But again, by no means is it a situation where the price drops below 13.
NEUT15|That implies everything is destroyed.
NEUT16|Now taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT17|That's where the purple line now begins to come into play.
BULL18|That 50 per moving average, which is finally leveled out and is going to start to curl and work its way upwards.
NEUT19|And that's very helpful, because when it comes just gauging the health of the bounce, that right there would be defined as, quote, unquote, the bounce, just watch a purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line, as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health bulls are in full control, having best visualize that that is what is being represented.
NEUT21|So yeah, stand above 13 would be great, but as long as the price is above that purple line, the polls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT22|Next key big battle ground to keep an eye on me right there at about $13.45.
NEUT23|So keep a close eye on 1345, but overall the bounce continues.
NEUT24|The week is young only Monday, so still four days left so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL28|To being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT34|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
