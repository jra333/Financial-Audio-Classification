NEUT0|"""Will this inclusion Dan reshape or change the S&P 500 index?"
NEUT1|Yeah, it's 1% of the market cap when it's all said and done and I think this is look at historic in terms of the magnitude, but also what it says about electric vehicles with tassel is done.
NEUT2|And of course that volatility that sometimes we see in Tessa.
NEUT3|Yeah I think maybe you could see a bit of that more in the S&P but this is something that you know.
NEUT4|It's a feather in the cap from us and tested to get this.
NEUT5|Not just in terms against the S&P 500 and what it means from an institutional ownership and indexing.
BEAR6|It's really bad.
NEUT7|Profitability because that's what it says.
NEUT8|It shows the readings in the rearview mirror that shot of credibility.
BULL9|I think it just shows how far we've come in the last few years, especially in the EV market.
BULL10|You know the ratings agency S&P Global Ratings also bumped up Tesla's credit rating to investment grade today.
NEUT11|What does that do?
NEUT12|What are the implications for Tesla now that that's happened?
NEUT13|Yeah, not me.
NEUT14|Now if you had that called 12 to 13 billion that they've raised and remember.
NEUT15|That was the biggest issue.
NEUT16|With Tesla is about the balance sheet capital structure.
NEUT17|Now in this euphoric rides, they've been able to to monetize that in terms of putting that in the treasure chest and what that's going to do, you know, will get there almost at investment grade, but I think it just shows you they go on the offensive in terms of capital bill that we see in Berlin.
NEUT18|We're going to see it in Austin.
NEUT19|I think eventually we're going to see in India as well as another factor and right now it's an arms race.
BULL20|In the EV market, it's just going to give them more and more flexibility in terms of raising debt as well as potential more equity.
NEUT21|Before we let you go, Tesla is now trading at about $673 a share.
NEUT22|What is your price target on the stock an?
NEUT23|What are you writing it down?
NEUT24|Yeah, base case is 560 in terms of price target, but but ultimately in terms of the bull case, $1000 if they continue to execute in China, that's why that China is so key.
NEUT25|And that's the key really.
NEUT26|Between the base and the bull.
NEUT27|I could tell you the T waves look very bullish coming out of Shanghai, and everything we're seeing in China for EV makers.
NEUT28|Not just Tesla, but Neo X, Ping and others.
NEUT29|I think we're going into a Golden age for EV.
NEUT30|$1000 a share?
NEUT31|When would that happen to your mind at some point next year?
NEUT32|That's a 12 to 18 month Bull case.
NEUT33|If they continue to execute an we see this type of demand.
NEUT34|China is the winch pin to that bull case thesis.
NEUT35|All right, Dan Ives of Wedbush always a pleasure.
BULL36|"Thanks for being with you."""
