BEAR0|"""What's going on in welcome back?"
NEUT1|Two sneaker.
NEUT2|How to.
NEUT3|In today's video, we're going to specifically be talking about whether you should hold our quick flip, the upcoming Air Jordan 4 Tap Hayes.
BULL4|This is a highly requested video from a lot of you guys, mainly from the Fire Red Ford video that we did do back in November where we did tell you guys to hold those sneakers an A lot of you were able to make extra cash an are still holding those sneakers would highly recommend to continue to hold the Fire Red Fours 'cause they are going to continue to increase.
BULL5|That was a really good hold.
NEUT6|And Congrats to you guys that did watch that video now for sale or holds in the future.

NEUT9|You should hold our quick flip, a pair of sneakers, so be sure to subscribe.
NEUT10|Turn post notifications on without further ado guys.
NEUT11|Let's get straight into it.
NEUT12|The expected resale prediction for the Air Jordan 4 Tap Hayes tomorrow is going to be around $300.00 for various sizes.
NEUT13|Now, if resale does hit an, it does spike.
NEUT14|You have access to these stickers tomorrow you have them in hand.
NEUT15|You can sell them and resell is possibly around 350.
NEUT16|I would recommend to go ahead and quick.
NEUT17|Flip that pair of sneakers if you have no intentions of holding the sneaker for at least one year because at $350.00 the sneakers are slightly overvalued because of the hype they have just sold out.
BULL18|They go up to 350 bucks as mill orders and restocks continue to happen.
BEAR19|The price will slowly decrease around that $300 mark.
NEUT20|As expected, now keep in mind these are just predictions for what we do expect to happen for tomorrow's release.
BEAR21|Now, if these do drop below 300 dollars 100%, these are a hold.
NEUT22|I would expect various sizes of the Air Jordan 4 top pays for an estimated resale prediction tomorrow to be around $300.00.
NEUT23|And personally if I do cop any pairs, I'm going to hold 100% for over a year.
NEUT24|And even if these sneakers get to that 350 mark tomorrow, I'm still going to personally hold because I want to sell it for more.
BULL25|And you definitely will be able to after one year.
NEUT26|Another Air Jordan 4 colorways that we have seen in the past.
NEUT27|The bread.
NEUT28|All of them are continuing to appreciate in value over time, so that's going to be the exact same scenario that we will see over time.
NEUT29|For the top Hays Force.
NEUT30|Now if you would like estimated resale predictions for the entire month of March, March is going to be a super crazy month for sneakers.
NEUT31|We have made an extensive calendar for Jordan Yeezy and Nike resale predictions for.
NEUT32|March 1st all the way through March 15th.
