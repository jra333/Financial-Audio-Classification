NEUT0|"""Certainly in conversations with a lot of the people we talked to over more than a year, that is."
NEUT1|That is what people were indicating.
NEUT2|Is that this really cements the shift at Apple from being a kind of design driven company into more of an operations driven company?
NEUT3|I mean, that had been coming for a long time and that have been taking place for a long time, but this is kind of the ultimate example of that.
NEUT4|So who's doing the designing now?
NEUT5|I mean, is it because there's no new products?
BULL6|I mean we even the wearables thing was interesting because it's been a relative success.
NEUT7|But you say inside the company they think they basically haven't had a hit since the iPad.
NEUT8|Look, they have a huge cross to bear.
NEUT9|The iPhone is an enormous product.
NEUT10|They still sell a tremendous amount of them and they still rake in a ton of profits.
BEAR11|I mean, they made $30 billion in the first half of this of their fiscal year, but by the same token, it's hard to replace that iPhone revenue as it begins to slow down.
NEUT12|And that's really what they're wrestling with, and the one big product that they've had is is the watch an.
NEUT13|It's just.
NEUT14|It's not priced at the same level as an iPhone, so.
NEUT15|For each iPhone sale that maybe takes a couple of years longer to sell, a watch isn't going to replace that revenue, and that's really the challenge there inside the company right now.
BEAR16|Sure, an I was personally disappointed in never came out with the charging pad.
BULL17|The wireless charging pad was really looking forward to that.
NEUT18|And you see, that's kind of emblematic of the challenges, but is that anything that has to do with Jony Ive being at fault that it didn't work?
NEUT19|Or is that more of an engineering issue?
NEUT20|That's more of an engineering issue.
BEAR21|They just couldn't meet the design.
NEUT22|It's it's a balance of both, really.
NEUT23|I mean, it's.
NEUT24|It's both the design issue and an engineering issue, and they ran into challenges in meeting the design specs and delivering on the engineering needs of that particular product.
NEUT25|I mean, talking with some people, they compared it to a dorm room hot plate.
NEUT26|If you drop change on it, it would heat up the change and it wouldn't evenly charge the devices that was supposed to and where.
NEUT27|So where does Apple go from here?
NEUT28|You know, do they need new design energy?
NEUT29|Or are they?
NEUT30|Should they double down on this more operational focus?
NEUT31|But it looks like and at first blush based on the announcement last week.
NEUT32|What they plan to do is double down on the operations focus they've they've put Jeff Williams in charge of the design team.
NEUT33|They've put a product designer in charge of the industrial design team that Johnny Long oversaw and worked with closely that it was almost like a family and will continue to be like a family.
NEUT34|That probably designer has been part of that family for a long time.
NEUT35|And then they'll have Allen die.
NEUT36|Who will be working on human interface.
NEUT37|But all of this is a change.
NEUT38|I mean Johnny's been in that role since 1996.
NEUT39|That's a long time.
NEUT40|And he's reeled off a tremendous number of products and a lot of those were, you know, the consequences or or the output of an outgrowth of his collaboration with Steve Jobs.
NEUT41|I mean, they almost had like a Lennon McCartney type of relationship.
NEUT42|And when you lose that, I mean you still get hits, but you don't.
NEUT43|"You don't reel off 20 number ones like The Beatles did."""
